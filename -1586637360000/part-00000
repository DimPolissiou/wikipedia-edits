[[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.\n\nIn 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire. He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 18</ref>  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Netherlands|Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates. Heinrich gave his son a choice\u2014he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious. He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity, which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 56</ref> He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results. Heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.<ref name=\"autogenerated43\">Cartwright (2010). p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 1805, Heinrich died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg. Although it was possible that his death was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.<ref>Safranski (1990), p. 12. \"There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.\"</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 88</ref>  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 4</ref> His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\"/>  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.<ref name=\"autogenerated43\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 90</ref>  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children.

Arthur and his mother were not on good terms.

Some of negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.<ref>Durant, Will, The Story of Philosophy, Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., New York, p. 350</ref>\nArthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.\n\nAfter quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Gotha]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha|de|3=Ernestinum Gotha|lt=Gymnasium illustre zu Gotha}}) in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 128</ref>  He left Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the lecturers.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.<ref name=\"autogenerated129\">Cartwright (2010). p. 129</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nHe moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother, who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.<ref name=\"autogenerated131\">Cartwright (2010). p. 131</ref> Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences. He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 116</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated131\"/> His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative\u2014and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.<ref name=\"autogenerated129\"/> Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater. By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]]. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 134</ref> Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 135</ref> Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 21</ref> In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 25</ref> In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits\u2014but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 22</ref>\n\nHe left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen|University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but G\u00f6ttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 140</ref> Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]]. Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 141\u2013144</ref> He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 144</ref> He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810\u201311 and he left G\u00f6ttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 150</ref>). He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\">Cartwright (2010). p. 170</ref> During his days at G\u00f6ttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 151</ref>\n\nHe arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811\u201312.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success. Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.<ref name=\"autogenerated159\">Cartwright (2010). p. 159</ref> He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms<ref name=\"autogenerated159\"/>\u2014seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 165\u2013169</ref> He also attended the lectures of the famous Protestant theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he also quickly came to dislike.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 174</ref> His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very [[Criticism of religion|critical of religion]] and moving towards [[atheism]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 175</ref> He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\"/> He attended philological courses by [[August B\u00f6ckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 171\u2013174</ref>\n\n=== Early work ===\nSchopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 179</ref> He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig M\u00fcller von Gerstenbergk (1778\u20131838), a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 188</ref> He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]]. Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's. Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements\u2014and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence\u2014soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 247\u2013265</ref> Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 256</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Cartwright (2010). p. 265</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 252</ref>\n\nAnother important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer \u2013 a [[historian of religion]], [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] \u2013 who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}}<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 266</ref> Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}} and put them at par with Plato and Kant.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 268</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Cartwright (2010). p. 272</ref> He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 267</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Schopenhauer held profound respect for [[Indian philosophy]];{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-69}} although he loved [[Hindu texts]] he was more interested in [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=76-77}} which he came to regard as the best religion.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> However, his studies on Hindu and Buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=69}} and the latter were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]].

He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.

As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of perception ===\nIn November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}</ref> He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its a priori character\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}</ref>\n\nBy this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\". Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber, \u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L. Rev., 1989</ref> Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].<ref name=\"Young2005\">{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130\u201347|jstor=43469632}}</ref> After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], \"I have not yet spoken my last word about women.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''On the Basis of Morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''On the Basis of Morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female.

Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.\" ''On the basis of morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref>\n\nHe was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel.

He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n===Intellectual interests and affinities===\n\n====[[Indology]]====\n[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]\n\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the [[Hindu texts|ancient Hindu texts]], the ''[[Upanishads]]'', which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. Schopenhauer considered [[India]] as \"the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom, the place from which Europeans could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways\",{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} and regarded the ''Upanishads'' as \"the most profitable and elevating reading which [...] is possible in the world. It has been the solace of my life, and will be the solace of my death.\"{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}}\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to Anquetil du Perron's Latin translation of the ''Upanishads'' through Friedrich Majer in 1814.{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother, according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\n{{quote|The view of things [...] that all plurality is only apparent, that in the endless series of individuals, passing simultaneously and successively into and out of life, generation after generation, age after age, there is but one and the same entity really existing, which is present and identical in all alike;\u2014this theory, I say, was of course known long before Kant; indeed, it may be carried back to the remotest antiquity.

In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''.

And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added].

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ...

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.

At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.

He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 408\u2013411</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 411\u2013414</ref>  It was his last visit to the country.

She had already had numerous lovers and a son out-of-wedlock, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 403\u2013404</ref> As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to a [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind her young son.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nSchopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin, he had a [[Premonition|prophetic dream]] that urged him to escape the city.<ref name=\"auto4\">Cartwright (2010). p. 436</ref> As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another [[Supernatural|supernatural experience]], an apparition of his dead father and his mother, who was still alive.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 437\u2013452</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 454</ref> He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 454\u2013457</ref> By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 458</ref> Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 460</ref> His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 463</ref>\n\nIn July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 464</ref> He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz. In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.<ref name=\"auto5\">Cartwright (2010). p. 506</ref> Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenst\u00e4dt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 507\u2013508</ref> They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 508</ref> He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nIn 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cartwright (2010). p. 514</ref> Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 465</ref> He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] for restoring order.<ref name=\"auto7\">Cartwright (2010). p. 515</ref>  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 517</ref> As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans\u2014and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]]\nIn 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 524</ref> The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.<ref name=\"auto8\">Cartwright (2010). p. 539</ref>  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,<ref name=\"auto9\">Cartwright (2010). pp. 381\u2013386</ref> or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.<ref name=\"auto9\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 537</ref> Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 525</ref> His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 394</ref> and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 510</ref>\n\nAcademic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]\u2019s very critical essay.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 536</ref> Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]] made a first of his four portraits of him\u2014which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like\u2014that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 540</ref> As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 541</ref>  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 542</ref>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]\nHe remained healthy in his old age, which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 544\u2013545</ref> He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].<ref name=\"auto10\">Cartwright (2010). p. 545</ref> He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''. In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 546</ref> His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and, according to him, Schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn't be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 546\u2013547</ref> He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],<ref>Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: \"Biographical sketch\".</ref> on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch.

Allen & Unwin.</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== The world as representation ===\nSchopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer.

They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of perception ===\nIn November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1.

His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\".

Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''On the Basis of Morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''On the Basis of Morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female.

Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.\" ''On the basis of morality'', \u00a7 19.</ref>\n\nHe was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour.

He was so impressed by their [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. Schopenhauer considered [[India]] as \"the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom, the place from which Europeans could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways\",{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} and regarded the ''Upanishads'' as \"the most profitable and elevating reading which [...] is possible in the world. It has been the solace of my life, and will be the solace of my death.\"{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}}\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to Anquetil du Perron's Latin translation of the ''Upanishads'' through Friedrich Majer in 1814.{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother, according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\n{{quote|The view of things [...] that all plurality is only apparent, that in the endless series of individuals, passing simultaneously and successively into and out of life, generation after generation, age after age, there is but one and the same entity really existing, which is present and identical in all alike;\u2014this theory, I say, was of course known long before Kant; indeed, it may be carried back to the remotest antiquity. It is the alpha and omega of the oldest book in the world, the sacred Vedas, whose dogmatic part, or rather esoteric teaching, is found in the Upanishads.

Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321).

In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol.

He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\" /><ref name=\"Presentation\" />\n\nSchopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.

The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.\n\nIn his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=|page=320}}</ref> The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of K\u00f6nigsberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant:\n\n{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,\n\nAnd there thy flight dissolved from view.\n\nAlone I stayed in the crowd below,\n\nThy word and thy book my only solace. \u2014|sign=|source=}}\n\nSchopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a criticism of the Kantian philosophy.\n\n===Post-Kantian school===\nThe leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]], Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 21.</ref> Rather, they were merely sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own interests and professional advancement. \n\n{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Loong actually compared such challenges to taking the [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] (HKCEE) although Loong never sat for such examinations. This was the only way to survive extension after extension since repeating of titles were not acceptable except for a small number of popular ones during first overseas tour in [[Vietnam]]. Loong said she talked her way out of performing in that first trip but had to perform with Kong<ref name=\"Kong\"/> in [[SE Asia]] the all-time popular title \"Time to Go Home (\u80e1\u4e0d\u6b78)\". The 21-day Singapore trip planned became 66-day stay (77 shows) in 1975. Mentor Yam did not agree to further extension even when approached by Ketra Ayers People's Theatre which had seen 77 full houses, including Buddhist nuns, with overflow at times. Chairs were added in the aisle and front of stage to accommodate the overflow.\n\nLoong's memory power, which, among other qualities in Loong, impressed mentor Yam, served her well in these occasions. Loong was said to have never studied or kept the manuscript at her make-up counter backstage. A manuscript in those days was like a phonebook in size written in [[Classical Chinese]] [[:zh-tw:\u6587\u8a00\u6587|\u6587\u8a00\u6587]] instead of [[Yue Chinese]], the everyday spoken language. Mentor Yam herself was known to \"study\" by just having younger sister to read it out loud for her while busy playing [[Mahjong]]. The general consensus has been that mentor Yam had \"good\" memory power. Yet, Yam was impressed by Loong.\n\n====Repertoire select====\n=====Martial arts=====\nWith the departure of <ref>Girl who chatted her way to job\nThe Straits Times, 5 August 1976, Page 7, credited as Kong Shuet Lo</ref>[http://www.hkmdb.com/db/people/view.mhtml?id=4135&display_set=eng Kong Suet-Liu] in 1976 after the second tour<sup>Issue#125</sup>{{efn-ua|name=fn11|50th Mark}} in [[SE Asia]], Loong could not find a compatible co-star for these three.

Despite objection of film producer (for unknown reason), Loong hired Yip Shiu-Tak ([[:zh-tw:\u8449\u7d39\u5fb7|\u8449\u7d39\u5fb7]]) to adapt it for stage with the support of mentor Yam and godfather [[Luo Pinchao]] whom Loong called Daddad \"\u7239\u7239\" as suggested by Yam. Both, Loong's second parents, were in the audience for debut.\n\n1982 Stage production [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|The Story of Emperor Li]] with the same plot/characters was invited by Mr. Hop Louie Woo, VP of [[Caesars Palace]]. Being the first to perform Cantonese opera in [[Las Vegas]], Loong was welcomed by Mayor [[William H. Briare]] and Mr. [[Harry Wald]]. As a pioneer in Cantonese opera community, Loong was visited by the other active male lead in the 1980s, a keen competitor,<ref name=\"2009-12-29\"/> backstage in the theatre. Local TV station was also on hand to film and interview. This win, golden commemorative shield awarded by Caesars Palace included, as a pioneer also promoted the former 1968 movie and a finale theme song (used in 1982 stage production but not the movie) released in 1964.Since 1998, the 1964 CD has been receiving [[Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong|CASH]] Golden Sail Most Performed Works Awards [http://www.cash.org.hk/en/index.php?main=4&id=28&sub=32 (Chinese Operatic Work)] just about every year. CD of two more theme songs from the stage production was released in 1990. Songs from the 1968 movie were never released in any form or shape for commercial purpose.\n\nYam wore the costume (king's wedding attire) from this movie in her casket while Loong donated her own costume (king's wedding attire) to museum in Hong Kong. Generations of performers continue to use a similar wedding attire as well as all the costume designed specifically for this 1982 stage production, like most of Yam-Loong costumes. These are from a different era compared to regular Cantonese opera costumes. It is a tradition for prot\u00e9g\u00e9e like Loong to copy costume from mentor like Yam as much as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e receiving the mentor's used costume in Cantonese opera community. That's an honor for the younger to be announced as the anointed heir and successor. Loong also appeared to take that honor to heart. Generally, there is no respect for copycats (performers copying the costume) or worse (using a stolen sword once used by a prior generation).\n\nDuring the 1984 North America tour, Mayor of New York honored the troupe she led just like [[Mei Lanfang]] was honored in the 1930s after the performance at Sun Sing Theatre. Loong presented Mayor [[Ed Koch]] with a framed seashell drawing ceremoniously in return.\n*Address: 75 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002\n*Ticket: US($50, $40, $30, $20 and $15)\nNote:-\nFor comparison purpose, ticket price in April 2017 for performance in Bay Area were US($80, $60, $40 and $30).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! 1984 \n!

Since costume covered most of the body, Loong said<ref name=\"programme.rthk.hk\"/> it was \"Thanks to Sin(\u5148) Si(\u5e2b) Wah(\u83ef) Kong(\u5149)!\" that she finished performances already scheduled without being noticed.\n\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=width:50%; background: #f9f9f9; border: 2px #000 solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\"\n|- \n!\u662f\u83ef\u5149\u5e2b\u5085\u4fdd\u7950!\n''Blessing from Sin Si Wah Kong!<ref>[http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/local_festivals/festivals/lunar9/9_3/index.html#&panel1-2 Birthday of Sin Si Wah Kong] The 28th day of 9th month of the Lunar Calendar</ref>''\n|}\n\nIn 2012<ref name=\"programme.rthk.hk\"/> and 2014,<ref name=\"\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\">[http://www.mingpaocanada.com/Tor/htm/News/20141009/HK-mba1_r.htm \u963f\u5228\u5922\u4e2d\u898b\u4efb\u59d0 \u5e2b\u5f92\u751f\u6b7b\u76f8\u5206]\u300c\u5bf6\u7389\u5931\u901a\u9748\u300d\u611f\u8ff7\u832b \u8eab\u9ad4\u6d88\u7626 \u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21 \u4e00\u4e5d\u4e5d\u96f6\u5e74\uff0c\u963f\u5228\u4f9d\u7136\u5fd9\u788c\u65bc\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u8eab\u9ad4\u65e5\u6f38\u6d88\u7626\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u6771\u897f\u90fd\u5403\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u66fe\u8a66\u904e\u4e00\u65e5\u4e4b\u5167\u770b\u56db\u500b\u91ab\u751f\u6aa2\u67e5\u8eab\u9ad4\uff0c\u79d8\u5bc6\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u627e\u4e0d\u51fa\u75c5\u6e90\uff0c\u5c31\u5728\u90a3\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4efb\u59d0\u8457\u5979\u4f11\u606f\u7684\u8a71\uff0c\u958b\u59cb\u5728\u963f\u5228\u8166\u6d77\u4e2d\u8ff4\u65cb\u3002 \u3010\u660e\u5831\u5c08\u8a0a\u30112014.10.09 \u767c\u8868</ref> Loong disclosed her trips seeking medical treatment and other events leading up to her decision. The death of mentor Yam in 1989 was instrumental to her poor health in those days. However, the decision to end the career on stage stemmed from mentor Yam suggestion<ref name=\"\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\"/> in mid-1980 since there were not any good manuscripts in sight. ([[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak]] died in 2009.) Her troupe could only keep staging 'run-of-the-mill' productions from mentor Yam's iconic roles as \"clean-shaven scholars\".\n\n===Must excel===\nTwo brothers who passed away in 1981 and 1985 were musicians who also composed well-known scores for Yam and many others of that generation in 1950\u20131980. Island of Farewell, the inaugural title for Loong, also was composed by the elder brother who was also one of the first music teacher for Loong.\n\nMentor Yam wanted more than just her legacy projects for Loong, the bread-winner<ref name=\"2009-12-29\"/><ref name=\"\u5442\u5927\u5442\"/><ref name=\"\u67f3\u5922\u6885\">[https://www.douban.com/group/topic/9047937/ \u7261\u4e39\u4ead\u4f86\u7684\u7537\u4eba] [[:zh-tw:\u5468\u8000\u8f1d|\u5468\u8000\u8f1d]]\n\u9019\u7bc7\u820a\u6587\uff0c\u539f\u767c\u8868\u65bc1990\u5e743\u670823\u65e5\u300a\u4fe1\u5831\u300b\u6587\u5316\u7248\u3002... \u5979\u8ff7\u4e0a\u7684\u662f\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u9f8d\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u662f\u6232\u4e2d\u7684\u4ed6\uff0c\u662f\u53f0\u4e0a\u90a3\u500b\u7537\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u8c61\u3002</ref> for a troupe with over 100 employees who were mostly paid per number of show instead of a salary. Loong would have been just a promotional tool of her mentor's legacy to keep running for decades that gravy train.\n\n(Over HK$350,000 ticket for one 12-show performance was sold out at 4am, in less than 24 hours, in the 1980s. When the box office opened at [[Sunbeam Theatre]], Loong found lines of anxious customers around the building. She arranged with the theatre all-hands-on-deck, veteran of Art Department fondly remembered in 2012, and box-office not to close until sold out.)\n\n===Structural deficit===\nOther events also explain her exhaustion include the close to 150 a year live productions on stage with only the stage manager, Mr. Leung Hiu-fai, by her side.\n\nAs patriarch of her troupe, Loong used to have two lieutenants from the dancer class of 1960. The two amigos with Loong were known as the three musketeers. They moved on in 1988 when her godfather [[Luo Pinchao]] also left China for the [[United States]].\n\nHer troupe was further re-organized in 1988/9 and two long time veterans also left the troupe. Since 1972, they had been the \"Madame Long\" from The Sword of a Loyal Family and [http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/entertainment/20111122/00282_030.html crew for Vietnam tour]. [[Lang Chi Bak]] [[:zh-tw:\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f|\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f]] (1905-1992) was over 80 years old in 1988. He stayed loyal to Loong's troupe, not taking jobs on the side. [[Lang Chi Bak]], like the uncle of [http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2009-12/04/content_19005955.htm Man] and Chan Kam-Tong, also volunteered to teach Loong and others for debuts, whether he had a role or not, in 1965 (no role), 1969 (no role) and 1972 (yes). They were not always given the credits even when it was due. There were photographs which marked the occasions.\n\nThose replacing these lost members listed above were not as disciplined or loyal. Yam was backstage and in the audience on 20 February 1989, to check on Loong when the troupe performed The Purple Hairpin for Tong Wah (a charity event), according to one veteran audience who kept that ticket as souvenir.\n\n===Last straw===\nMentor Yam managed the '''lid''' by refusing radio interview requested by [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak]] although she couldn't stop someone (related in a way [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yuen]] called 'no divorce mechanism'\u300c\u9640\u540d\u639b\u5b57\u300d) showing up without invitation at [[Kai Tak Airport]] for photo-op with a school age child on a school day to bid her farewell in front of the Press which 'happened' to be there. That resulted magazine cover was the only public photo Yam had with former acquaintance since the December 1969 wedding banquet of a musician. Record speaks volume about the intention. The acquaintance paid Yam a visit backstage for the Press only after movie roles dried up. Prior to such reality, a group photo as one of the \"kids\" in 1968 at [[Kai Tak Airport]] did not happen. Opportunities to work with mentor Yam in a film or on stage were all rejected.\n\nBefore leaving for [[Canada]] on 9 June 1987, Yam was busy talking business with [[Luo Pinchao]] and holding on to Loong as a walking stick, before joining three co-workers of Loong for a press conference. To the Press, however, Yam always kept a distance since 1982 debut of [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|The Story of Emperor Li]]. Her involvement would have otherwise cast a long shadow on \nLoong. Yam named all four (Kong,<ref name=\"Kong\"/> the fifth, left months ago) remaining \"kids\" individually in 1977 to the Press, talking how proud of the box-office they achieved and refusing, too old and weak, to take in more \"kids\". (Records set by all five in SE Asia tours still hold today.) Loong, the assigned messenger, also was keeping the Press posted in all fronts<ref name=\"\u7d30\u8aaa\u4efb\u3001\u9f8d\u3001\u96db\">{{cite web|language=en|title=\u68a8\u5712\u5ba2(1986)|url=http://library.hku.hk/record=b1571134|publisher=\u7d30\u8aaa\u4efb\u3001\u9f8d\u3001\u96db \u9999\u6e2f : \u9999\u6e2f\u5468\u520a\u51fa\u7248\u793e}}</ref><ref name=\"\u7d30\u8aaa\u7576\u5e74\">\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19 - \u7d30\u8aaa\u7576\u5e74 \u5275\u85dd\u6587\u5316\u4f01\u696d\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u51fa\u7248 (Publisher:Chuang Yi Wen Hua Qi Ye You Xian Gong Si)</ref>{{efn-ua|name=fn4|Biography}} and writing a newspaper column called \"\u963f\u5228\u8a71\u4f60\u77e5\" (Translate: Loong \"\u963f\u5228\" tells you) for a while in 1985.\n\nThe Yam MIC (as Eisenhower's MIC) was born on 29 November 1989. All hell broke loose. Book deals, interviews on TV, by the Press in general, academics' researches, former acquaintances, etc. became the livelihood of those not even remotely related to the group. Distractions from performances on stage as predicted long time ago popped up everywhere but mentor Yam cannot rein them in from six feet under. There were enough \"kids\" of Yam to form two soccer teams all of a sudden although Yam did not associate with them at all. 29 August 1982, Yam returned from Europe to Hong Kong with a broken left-wrist. Loong was the one photographed holding/helping (\u670d\u4f8d) the mentor who looked agitated/frightened at [[Kai Tak Airport]].\n\nLoong realized the exhaustion and illness could appear on stage one day. Better be safe than be sorry (\u737b\u919c\u4e0d\u5982\u85cf\u62d9) is Loong's motto. That would bring shame to mentor Yam who is known to care about the reputation as reflected by this ''offspring'' ([[:zh-tw:\u5f92\u5f1f|\u5b50\u4f84]]) shaped by her own two hands and introduced to the wider audience on 24 June 1972, [[TVB]] telethon event that was hosted for the victims in the [[1972 Hong Kong rainstorm disasters|June 18 landslide]].\n\n==Comeback==\nIn November 2004, in commemoration of 15th anniversary of her passing, her mentor Yam Kim Fai, Loong returned to the stage.

This requirement from mentor Yam explains the challenge for Loong to be on stage within a six-month period and provide 40 different (in some way in one or two acts out of total 6 to 8) but still GOOD interpretations without changing the show as a whole. This organic way, to hunt/harvest for the meal instead of \"frozen\" or \"canned\", was the only way acceptable to Yam and therefore set Loong apart from classmates or performers of a generation from early on.\n\nThat makes it worthwhile for those who pay for their tickets<ref name=\"\u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f20091210\">For the 20th anniversary, 10 December 2009 [[RTHK]] radio 1 \u3010Free as the Wind\u3011 \u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u901d\u4e16\u4e8c\u5341\u5468\u5e74\u2212 (\u4e8c\u96f6\u96f6\u4e5d\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u65e5) \u9999\u6e2f\u96fb\u53f0\u7b2c\u4e00\u53f0\uff1a\u300a[http://programme.rthk.hk/channel/radio/programme.php?name=radio1/Free_as_the_wind&p=3173 \u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f]\u300b\u7bc0\u76ee\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba\u76e7\u5049\u529b\u3001\u99ac\u6069\u8cdc\u3001\u5609\u8cd3:\u6f58\u6b65\u91d7\u3001[[:zh-tw:\u962e\u5146\u8f1d|\u962e\u5146\u8f1d]]:\u5929\u5929\u4ee5\u53ca\u5834\u5834\u65b0\u9baefresh \uff0c\u6709\u5167\u6db5Connotation\u800c\u597d\u81ea\u7136natural \uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u53c8\u6709\u5149\u5f69luster \uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6c92\u6709\u65a7\u947f\u75d5\u8de1look effortless\u3002....'''\u4f62\u884c\u51fa\u569f\u5c31\u4fc2\u35ce\u5566\uff0c\u5187\u5f97\u6559\u35ce\u558e\u3002''' To capture attention the way like Loong can is not taught.

However, she did not take in pupils or students, if not for a fee, to elevate herself as many do in the Cantonese opera community. Instead, she called them \"young ladies\" in radio interview (Vancouver, BC) when three of them visited her to get some rehearsals and training done for the 2015/6 event. Loong sat idle waiting for rehearsals back when she worked with female leads who were being trained right in the middle of a rehearsal/review session. Having had those close encounters as a male lead on top of having been trained for other female roles herself performed, though few and far between because of the voice she has, Loong put all those years/months/days/hours of observations/trainings to good use. [[Cherie Chung]] is said to be a fan of Loong because of her (female role) performance in The Handsome Pan'an.\n\n===Excerpts of Cantonese opera by Lung Kim-sang===\nIn 2014,<ref>[http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/entertainment/20141231/bkn-20141231213144582-1231_00862_001.html \u300c\u4efb\u767d\u300d\u5f97\u610f\u9580\u751f\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19\uff08\u963f\u5228\uff09\u6f14\u51fa\u517125\u5834\u300a\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5\u300b\u6298\u5b50\u6232\u5713\u6eff\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u963f\u5228\u5728\u5c3e\u5834\u6dda\u6d78\u6232\u53f0\uff0c\u6559\u4eba\u52d5\u5bb9\u3002\u7206106\u6b72\u6bcd\u89aa\u9577\u58fd\u79d8\u8a23] \u3010on.cc\u6771\u7db2\u5c08\u8a0a\u3011 [http://www.macaodaily.com/html/2014-11/17/content_951764.htm \u5c0d\u5169\u4f4d\u5e74\u8f15\u82b1\u65e6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6b64\u4e43\u5929\u4e0a\u6389\u4e0b\u4f86\u3001\u5343\u8f09\u96e3\u9022\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u4e5f\uff01\u963f\u5228\u98a8\u91c7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203014501/http://www.macaodaily.com/html/2014-11/17/content_951764.htm |date=2014-12-03 }}\u3010\u6fb3\u9580\u65e5\u5831\u3011[http://ent.appledaily.com.tw/enews/article/entertainment/20141118/36213839 \u53f0\u8a9e\u570b\u5bf6x\u7cb5\u5287\u570b\u5bf6 \u6c5f\u8559\u9999\u6e2f\u4ea4\u6d41\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19] \u3010\u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831\u3011</ref> Loong, for the first time, shared stage with and opposite new \"love interests\" to commemorate the quarter of a century since the passing of her mentor Yam.

Loong shared the stage with the original cast in 1968/9 and then the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"\u85aa\u706b\u76f8\u50b3\">[http://operapreview.com/index.php/%E7%B6%B2%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%9C%E8%AA%8C/%E8%88%9E%E5%8F%B0%E5%82%B3%E7%9C%9F/item/464 \u6232\u66f2\u54c1\u5473\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b] \u4eca\u6b21\u6f14\u51fa\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b\u5168\u5287\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u8aaa\u662f\u85aa\u706b\u76f8\u50b3\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u8b93\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u770b\u770b\u548c\u611f\u53d7\u4e00\u4e0b\u5979\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u6f14\u7e79\uff0c\u6642\u9593\u6c38\u9060\u8d70\u5728\u524d\uff0c\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u4eba\u751f\u52a0\u6dfb\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u53c8\u4e00\u6bb5\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u56de\u61b6\u548c\u7121\u9650\u601d\u5ff5\u3002</ref>\n\n===The Peony Pavilion===\n[[The Peony Pavilion]] was one of the five titles mentor Yam shared the stage with Loong and classmates in 1968/69/70. Chu (1972 in orange dress) and Koi (1972 in green dress), instead of Loong, shared the two characters usually played by second male lead in this title. Chu was the '''''emperor''''' while Koi (1941\uff0d2007) was the '''''cousin'''''. They did not have much interaction with Yam on stage. (That may or may not be the reason, as an exception, Loong did not get to play these.) Chu talked about her own experience in an interview as to how to cope with '''''realizing the wrong name out of her mouth''''' and the mentor Yam who could deal with it.\n\nAnother highlight of this title is the major role of second female lead, originally (as well as in 68/69/70) played by Art Director Yam Bing Yee ([[:zh-tw:\u4efb\u51b0\u5152|\u4efb\u51b0\u5152]]), younger sister of mentor Yam. She was part of the main theme of original Act One in 1956 but not since. Audience was not patient to see the first and second female leads on stage for over half an hour before the character played by mentor Yam showed up. The third female lead, the younger '''''nun''''', had scripted interaction with mentor Yam but did not get good review.<sup>Issue#108/116/122</sup>{{efn-ua|name=fn11|50th Mark}}\n\nPutting full version of this title (Chinese: \u9f8d\u528d\u7b19 - \u7261\u4e39\u4ead\u9a5a\u5922\u5168\u5287) on stage in 2017/8 completed the 2014 event in remembrance of mentor Yam.\n\n===A Romance of Pear Blossoms===\nBeing the center of attention in that 1950s troupe at the ''make or break'' moment, Yam delivered and demonstrated her AAA on stage in 1957. Yam's performance over 60 years ago at debut of this title launched or saved the now only known career of her co-star and usual plus-one for decades.\n\nOnly two of the young performers who are in their early 30s and joined Loong in 2014 remain in her team of six pillars; Cheng Nga-ki as the female lead and Lai Yiu-wai (Keith) playing a character created by Lang Chi Bak.\n\nAlso, Wyborn Leung returns to play a character created by [[Leung Sing Bor]], third time in a row. Wyborn and Leung Sing Bor are not relatives but their physiques are very much alike. This is vital for the last few titles of [[Tang Ti-sheng]] who tailored the manuscripts to match the six pillars.\n\nWyborn's father, Leung Hon Wai who was a peer of Loong, worked closely with Leung Sing Bor for over a decade and talked about their regular trips to movie theaters on television. However, Wyborn was not raised to follow the path of a clown like Leung Sing Bor by his father who was very knowledgeable about that acting style, unlike those performers who took these roles only because they are fat and old. Neither did Wyborn have more than fat and old performers to guide him until Loong was looking for kids to work with a few years ago.\n\nThese are \"kids\" to Loong, the same way Yam called Loong and her classmates for years.\n\n===Di N\u00fc Hua===\n13 Shows (28 November - 14 December) in 2019 to commemorate 30 years (1989-2019) since the passing of mentor [[Yam Kim Fai]].\n\n===The Reincarnation of a Beauty===\nThe kids have yet to learn from Loong, the only surviving male lead who worked on stage (day in, day out) with both [[Leung Sing Bor]] and [[Lang Chi Bak]] in this last title of [[Tang Ti-sheng]]. Lang addressed Loong on stage as ''Mr. Pui'' (\u88f4\u751f) in Cantonese. That sounds very similar to Loong's birth name ''Pui Sang'' (\u83e9\u751f).\n\n==AAA on stage==\nAAA (art, acrobatics, acting) and stage presence, eye popping to Yam, described and compared to mentor Yam by Cantonese opera veterans and up-and-coming performers, as:\n\n#With grace or chic ([[:zh-tw:GQ|\u701f\u7051]]) and charm, take the stage (\u4eae\u76f8), ooze charisma and enchant their audiences.<ref name=\"\u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f20091210\"/><ref name=\"\u963f\u5228\u6f14\u7e79\u5e2b\u7236\u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u6d3e\u529f\u592b\uff0c\u513c\u5982\u5e2b\u7236\u4e0a\u8eab\u822c\">{{cite web|language=en|url=http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/entertainment/20160101/bkn-20160101152050007-0101_00862_001.html|title=\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b\u5168\u5287\u3000\u963f\u5228\u6f14\u7e79\u5e2b\u7236\u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u6d3e\u529f\u592b\uff0c\u513c\u5982\u5e2b\u7236\u4e0a\u8eab\u822c|publisher=\u3010on.cc\u6771\u7db2\u5c08\u8a0a\u3011}}</ref><ref>1985 Radio broadcast [http://app4.rthk.hk/special/rthkmemory/details/profile/31 June 15], \u7d05\u4f36\u8a34\u5fc3\u8072\uff1a [[:zh-tw:\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f|\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f]], [[Lang Chi Bak]], the classmate of [[Sit Gok Sin]] and co-worker of both mentor and protegee at one point of their career.</ref><ref>[https://m.facebook.com/hammerout.hk/posts/983525905048208 \u9b45\u529b\u8001\u500c] [[\u660e\u5831]] \u300a\u5de6\u53f3\u98ef\u5c40\u300b[[:zh-tw:\u674e\u6167\u73b2|\u674e\u6167\u73b2]]</ref>\n#Loong's eyes (\u95dc\u76ee) [http://app4.rthk.hk/special/rthkmemory/details/artscritique/228 can talk], according to [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak,]] and communicate emotions to fellow performers and audiences, according to new \"love interests\".

This veteran shared the stage with both Loong (including 2014) and Yam (only once according to himself in 2009 TV interview).\n\nIn 1999, the 10th anniversary of passing of mentor Yam, Loong disclosed the first time on camera, Yam's rule of thumb, \"Be Natural\" ({{zh|links=no|c=\u81ea\u7136\u5c31\u662f\u7f8e}}).\"2015 Talk on the Rendition of Yam Kim Fai\", as just about all those have been speaking publicly since 1999, referred to this term first coined by Loong.\n\nAgain in 2013 to 2016, Loong shared more of her \"heritance\" with up-and-coming performers. For example, the new \"love interests\" were asked to study meticulously the manuscript and to memorize the lines before meeting Loong in September 2013 for rehearsals in Vancouver BC. Moreover, Loong suggested that studying beyond their own lines would give them an advantage on stage generally.\n\nNo painting the town red. As ethical standard, Loong instituted in them ''responsibility to stay warm/eat healthy'' and ''compete only by performance on stage''. (That was the manner Yam preferred, no fighting with classmates, per Chu, '''''\u6731 [https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8A%8D \u528d] \u4e39\u5e2b\u5085'''.)''\n\n==Accolades==\n===1990 Artists of the Year Awards in acting===\nLoong was awarded in 1990 the best actor's award by the Hong Kong Artists Alliance.\n\n===2016 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], DVD \"[[Zi Chai Ji (Quan Ju)]]\" '''\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18(\u5168\u5287)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-16/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2016|title=2016|website=www.ifpihk.org}}</ref>\n\n===2015 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], just received encouragement for her effort to remember her mentor [[Yam Kim Fai]] and pay-it-forward to bring up-and-coming performers onto stage in 2014.\n\nDVD of the event \"[[Ren Yi Sheng Hui Nian Long Qing]]\" ('''\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5'''), one of the '''2015 Best Sales Releases''', Classical and Operatic Works Recording, was '''live recording''' of 2014 stage production.<ref>\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5 [http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-15/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2015 IFPI HKG 2015] List of Best Sales Releases, Classical and Operatic Works Recording (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts)</ref>\n\nLoong was one of \"'''Ten Best Sales Local Artistes'''\" (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts) for the third album after the award for two released in 2012.\n\n===2012 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], DVD \"[[Ren Qu Sheng Yun]]\" ('''[http://blogcity.me/blog/reply_blog_express.asp?f=O6UTGN1KPQ207828&id=519245 \u4efb\u66f2\u7b19\u97fb]''') and \"[[Long Qing Shi Yi Ban Shi Ji]]\" ('''\u9f8d\u60c5\u8a69\u610f\u534a\u4e16\u7d00''').<ref>[http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-11/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2012 IFPI HKG 2012, first year] List of Best Sales Releases, Classical and Operatic Works Recording (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts)</ref>\n\n===2011 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], was awarded The IFPI Hong Kong Award for Excellent Contribution to Cantonese Opera IFPI ('''\u9999\u6e2f\u7cb5\u5287\u8ca2\u737b\u5927\u734e''').<ref>[http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-11/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2011 IFPI HKG 2011] The IFPI Hong Kong Award for Excellent Contribution to Cantonese Opera.</ref>\n\n===1982 Gold Disc award===\n[http://rthk.hk/chineseopera/opera30th/song_19.htm '''\u6d1e\u5ead\u5341\u9001''']<ref name=\"\u67f3\u6bc5\u50b3\u66f8\">[http://www.ifpihk.org/gold-disc-award-presented/1982 1982 Gold Disc Award]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-4}}\n\n===50th mark===\n\n'''\u300a\u6232\u66f2\u54c1\u5473\u6708\u520a\u300b'''\n\nissue 133 -

For example, she showed the \"kids\" a trick, to overcome shyness at 1969 photo shoot, Loong still employed in 2015 to get into her character instantly. However, Yam did not take the bow again at curtain calls, steal thunder from \"kids\" for vanity unlike in 1965 when she had to since no \"kids\" was in charge.

Loong actually compared such challenges to taking the [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] (HKCEE) although Loong never sat for such examinations. This was the only way to survive extension after extension since repeating of titles were not acceptable except for a small number of popular ones during first overseas tour in [[Vietnam]]. Loong said she talked her way out of performing in that first trip but had to perform with Kong<ref name=\"Kong\"/> in [[SE Asia]] the all-time popular title \"Time to Go Home (\u80e1\u4e0d\u6b78)\". The 21-day Singapore trip planned became 66-day stay (77 shows) in 1975. Mentor Yam did not agree to further extension even when approached by Ketra Ayers People's Theatre which had seen 77 full houses, including Buddhist nuns, with overflow at times. Chairs were added in the aisle and front of stage to accommodate the overflow.\n\nLoong's memory power, which, among other qualities in Loong, impressed mentor Yam, served her well in these occasions. Loong was said to have never studied or kept the manuscript at her make-up counter backstage. A manuscript in those days was like a phonebook in size written in [[Classical Chinese]] [[:zh-tw:\u6587\u8a00\u6587|\u6587\u8a00\u6587]] instead of [[Yue Chinese]], the everyday spoken language. Mentor Yam herself was known to \"study\" by just having younger sister to read it out loud for her while busy playing [[Mahjong]]. The general consensus has been that mentor Yam had \"good\" memory power. Yet, Yam was impressed by Loong.\n\n====Repertoire select====\n=====Martial arts=====\nWith the departure of <ref>Girl who chatted her way to job\nThe Straits Times, 5 August 1976, Page 7, credited as Kong Shuet Lo</ref>[http://www.hkmdb.com/db/people/view.mhtml?id=4135&display_set=eng Kong Suet-Liu] in 1976 after the second tour<sup>Issue#125</sup>{{efn-ua|name=fn11|50th Mark}} in [[SE Asia]], Loong could not find a compatible co-star for these three.

Despite objection of film producer (for unknown reason), Loong hired Yip Shiu-Tak ([[:zh-tw:\u8449\u7d39\u5fb7|\u8449\u7d39\u5fb7]]) to adapt it for stage with the support of mentor Yam and godfather [[Luo Pinchao]] whom Loong called Daddad \"\u7239\u7239\" as suggested by Yam. Both, Loong's second parents, were in the audience for debut.\n\n1982 Stage production [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|The Story of Emperor Li]] with the same plot/characters was invited by Mr. Hop Louie Woo, VP of [[Caesars Palace]]. Being the first to perform Cantonese opera in [[Las Vegas]], Loong was welcomed by Mayor [[William H. Briare]] and Mr. [[Harry Wald]]. As a pioneer in Cantonese opera community, Loong was visited by the other active male lead in the 1980s, a keen competitor,<ref name=\"2009-12-29\"/> backstage in the theatre. Local TV station was also on hand to film and interview. This win, golden commemorative shield awarded by Caesars Palace included, as a pioneer also promoted the former 1968 movie and a finale theme song (used in 1982 stage production but not the movie) released in 1964.Since 1998, the 1964 CD has been receiving [[Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong|CASH]] Golden Sail Most Performed Works Awards [http://www.cash.org.hk/en/index.php?main=4&id=28&sub=32 (Chinese Operatic Work)] just about every year. CD of two more theme songs from the stage production was released in 1990. Songs from the 1968 movie were never released in any form or shape for commercial purpose.\n\nYam wore the costume (king's wedding attire) from this movie in her casket while Loong donated her own costume (king's wedding attire) to museum in Hong Kong. Generations of performers continue to use a similar wedding attire as well as all the costume designed specifically for this 1982 stage production, like most of Yam-Loong costumes. These are from a different era compared to regular Cantonese opera costumes. It is a tradition for prot\u00e9g\u00e9e like Loong to copy costume from mentor like Yam as much as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e receiving the mentor's used costume in Cantonese opera community. That's an honor for the younger to be announced as the anointed heir and successor. Loong also appeared to take that honor to heart. Generally, there is no respect for copycats (performers copying the costume) or worse (using a stolen sword once used by a prior generation).\n\nDuring the 1984 North America tour, Mayor of New York honored the troupe she led just like [[Mei Lanfang]] was honored in the 1930s after the performance at Sun Sing Theatre. Loong presented Mayor [[Ed Koch]] with a framed seashell drawing ceremoniously in return.\n*Address: 75 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002\n*Ticket: US($50, $40, $30, $20 and $15)\nNote:-\nFor comparison purpose, ticket price in April 2017 for performance in Bay Area were US($80, $60, $40 and $30).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! 1984 \n!

Since costume covered most of the body, Loong said<ref name=\"programme.rthk.hk\"/> it was \"Thanks to Sin(\u5148) Si(\u5e2b) Wah(\u83ef) Kong(\u5149)!\" that she finished performances already scheduled without being noticed.\n\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=width:50%; background: #f9f9f9; border: 2px #000 solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\"\n|- \n!\u662f\u83ef\u5149\u5e2b\u5085\u4fdd\u7950!\n''Blessing from Sin Si Wah Kong!<ref>[http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/local_festivals/festivals/lunar9/9_3/index.html#&panel1-2 Birthday of Sin Si Wah Kong] The 28th day of 9th month of the Lunar Calendar</ref>''\n|}\n\nIn 2012<ref name=\"programme.rthk.hk\"/> and 2014,<ref name=\"\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\">[http://www.mingpaocanada.com/Tor/htm/News/20141009/HK-mba1_r.htm \u963f\u5228\u5922\u4e2d\u898b\u4efb\u59d0 \u5e2b\u5f92\u751f\u6b7b\u76f8\u5206]\u300c\u5bf6\u7389\u5931\u901a\u9748\u300d\u611f\u8ff7\u832b \u8eab\u9ad4\u6d88\u7626 \u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21 \u4e00\u4e5d\u4e5d\u96f6\u5e74\uff0c\u963f\u5228\u4f9d\u7136\u5fd9\u788c\u65bc\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u8eab\u9ad4\u65e5\u6f38\u6d88\u7626\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u6771\u897f\u90fd\u5403\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u66fe\u8a66\u904e\u4e00\u65e5\u4e4b\u5167\u770b\u56db\u500b\u91ab\u751f\u6aa2\u67e5\u8eab\u9ad4\uff0c\u79d8\u5bc6\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u627e\u4e0d\u51fa\u75c5\u6e90\uff0c\u5c31\u5728\u90a3\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4efb\u59d0\u8457\u5979\u4f11\u606f\u7684\u8a71\uff0c\u958b\u59cb\u5728\u963f\u5228\u8166\u6d77\u4e2d\u8ff4\u65cb\u3002 \u3010\u660e\u5831\u5c08\u8a0a\u30112014.10.09 \u767c\u8868</ref> Loong disclosed her trips seeking medical treatment and other events leading up to her decision. The death of mentor Yam in 1989 was instrumental to her poor health in those days. However, the decision to end the career on stage stemmed from mentor Yam suggestion<ref name=\"\u5165\u9662\u5169\u6b21\"/> in mid-1980 since there were not any good manuscripts in sight. ([[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak]] died in 2009.) Her troupe could only keep staging 'run-of-the-mill' productions from mentor Yam's iconic roles as \"clean-shaven scholars\".\n\n===Must excel===\nTwo brothers who passed away in 1981 and 1985 were musicians who also composed well-known scores for Yam and many others of that generation in 1950\u20131980. Island of Farewell, the inaugural title for Loong, also was composed by the elder brother who was also one of the first music teacher for Loong.\n\nMentor Yam wanted more than just her legacy projects for Loong, the bread-winner<ref name=\"2009-12-29\"/><ref name=\"\u5442\u5927\u5442\"/><ref name=\"\u67f3\u5922\u6885\">[https://www.douban.com/group/topic/9047937/ \u7261\u4e39\u4ead\u4f86\u7684\u7537\u4eba] [[:zh-tw:\u5468\u8000\u8f1d|\u5468\u8000\u8f1d]]\n\u9019\u7bc7\u820a\u6587\uff0c\u539f\u767c\u8868\u65bc1990\u5e743\u670823\u65e5\u300a\u4fe1\u5831\u300b\u6587\u5316\u7248\u3002... \u5979\u8ff7\u4e0a\u7684\u662f\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u9f8d\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u662f\u6232\u4e2d\u7684\u4ed6\uff0c\u662f\u53f0\u4e0a\u90a3\u500b\u7537\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u8c61\u3002</ref> for a troupe with over 100 employees who were mostly paid per number of show instead of a salary. Loong would have been just a promotional tool of her mentor's legacy to keep running for decades that gravy train.\n\n(Over HK$350,000 ticket for one 12-show performance was sold out at 4am, in less than 24 hours, in the 1980s. When the box office opened at [[Sunbeam Theatre]], Loong found lines of anxious customers around the building. She arranged with the theatre all-hands-on-deck, veteran of Art Department fondly remembered in 2012, and box-office not to close until sold out.)\n\n===Structural deficit===\nOther events also explain her exhaustion include the close to 150 a year live productions on stage with only the stage manager, Mr. Leung Hiu-fai, by her side.\n\nAs patriarch of her troupe, Loong used to have two lieutenants from the dancer class of 1960. The two amigos with Loong were known as the three musketeers. They moved on in 1988 when her godfather [[Luo Pinchao]] also left China for the [[United States]].\n\nHer troupe was further re-organized in 1988/9 and two long time veterans also left the troupe. Since 1972, they had been the \"Madame Long\" from The Sword of a Loyal Family and [http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/entertainment/20111122/00282_030.html crew for Vietnam tour]. [[Lang Chi Bak]] [[:zh-tw:\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f|\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f]] (1905-1992) was over 80 years old in 1988. He stayed loyal to Loong's troupe, not taking jobs on the side. [[Lang Chi Bak]], like the uncle of [http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2009-12/04/content_19005955.htm Man] and Chan Kam-Tong, also volunteered to teach Loong and others for debuts, whether he had a role or not, in 1965 (no role), 1969 (no role) and 1972 (yes). They were not always given the credits even when it was due. There were photographs which marked the occasions.\n\nThose replacing these lost members listed above were not as disciplined or loyal. Yam was backstage and in the audience on 20 February 1989, to check on Loong when the troupe performed The Purple Hairpin for Tong Wah (a charity event), according to one veteran audience who kept that ticket as souvenir.\n\n===Last straw===\nMentor Yam managed the '''lid''' by refusing radio interview requested by [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak]] although she couldn't stop someone (related in a way [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yuen]] called 'no divorce mechanism'\u300c\u9640\u540d\u639b\u5b57\u300d) showing up without invitation at [[Kai Tak Airport]] for photo-op with a school age child on a school day to bid her farewell in front of the Press which 'happened' to be there. That resulted magazine cover was the only public photo Yam had with former acquaintance since the December 1969 wedding banquet of a musician. Record speaks volume about the intention. The acquaintance paid Yam a visit backstage for the Press only after movie roles dried up. Prior to such reality, a group photo as one of the \"kids\" in 1968 at [[Kai Tak Airport]] did not happen. Opportunities to work with mentor Yam in a film or on stage were all rejected.\n\nBefore leaving for [[Canada]] on 9 June 1987, Yam was busy talking business with [[Luo Pinchao]] and holding on to Loong as a walking stick, before joining three co-workers of Loong for a press conference. To the Press, however, Yam always kept a distance since 1982 debut of [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|The Story of Emperor Li]]. Her involvement would have otherwise cast a long shadow on \nLoong. Yam named all four (Kong,<ref name=\"Kong\"/> the fifth, left months ago) remaining \"kids\" individually in 1977 to the Press, talking how proud of the box-office they achieved and refusing, too old and weak, to take in more \"kids\". (Records set by all five in SE Asia tours still hold today.) Loong, the assigned messenger, also was keeping the Press posted in all fronts<ref name=\"\u7d30\u8aaa\u4efb\u3001\u9f8d\u3001\u96db\">{{cite web|language=en|title=\u68a8\u5712\u5ba2(1986)|url=http://library.hku.hk/record=b1571134|publisher=\u7d30\u8aaa\u4efb\u3001\u9f8d\u3001\u96db \u9999\u6e2f : \u9999\u6e2f\u5468\u520a\u51fa\u7248\u793e}}</ref><ref name=\"\u7d30\u8aaa\u7576\u5e74\">\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19 - \u7d30\u8aaa\u7576\u5e74 \u5275\u85dd\u6587\u5316\u4f01\u696d\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u51fa\u7248 (Publisher:Chuang Yi Wen Hua Qi Ye You Xian Gong Si)</ref>{{efn-ua|name=fn4|Biography}} and writing a newspaper column called \"\u963f\u5228\u8a71\u4f60\u77e5\" (Translate: Loong \"\u963f\u5228\" tells you) for a while in 1985.\n\nThe Yam MIC (as Eisenhower's MIC) was born on 29 November 1989. All hell broke loose. Book deals, interviews on TV, by the Press in general, academics' researches, former acquaintances, etc. became the livelihood of those not even remotely related to the group. Distractions from performances on stage as predicted long time ago popped up everywhere but mentor Yam cannot rein them in from six feet under. There were enough \"kids\" of Yam to form two soccer teams all of a sudden although Yam did not associate with them at all. 29 August 1982, Yam returned from Europe to Hong Kong with a broken left-wrist. Loong was the one photographed holding/helping (\u670d\u4f8d) the mentor who looked agitated/frightened at [[Kai Tak Airport]].\n\nLoong realized the exhaustion and illness could appear on stage one day. Better be safe than be sorry (\u737b\u919c\u4e0d\u5982\u85cf\u62d9) is Loong's motto. That would bring shame to mentor Yam who is known to care about the reputation as reflected by this ''offspring'' ([[:zh-tw:\u5f92\u5f1f|\u5b50\u4f84]]) shaped by her own two hands and introduced to the wider audience on 24 June 1972, [[TVB]] telethon event that was hosted for the victims in the [[1972 Hong Kong rainstorm disasters|June 18 landslide]].\n\n==Comeback==\nIn November 2004, in commemoration of 15th anniversary of her passing, her mentor Yam Kim Fai, Loong returned to the stage.

This requirement from mentor Yam explains the challenge for Loong to be on stage within a six-month period and provide 40 different (in some way in one or two acts out of total 6 to 8) but still GOOD interpretations without changing the show as a whole. This organic way, to hunt/harvest for the meal instead of \"frozen\" or \"canned\", was the only way acceptable to Yam and therefore set Loong apart from classmates or performers of a generation from early on.\n\nThat makes it worthwhile for those who pay for their tickets<ref name=\"\u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f20091210\">For the 20th anniversary, 10 December 2009 [[RTHK]] radio 1 \u3010Free as the Wind\u3011 \u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u901d\u4e16\u4e8c\u5341\u5468\u5e74\u2212 (\u4e8c\u96f6\u96f6\u4e5d\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u65e5) \u9999\u6e2f\u96fb\u53f0\u7b2c\u4e00\u53f0\uff1a\u300a[http://programme.rthk.hk/channel/radio/programme.php?name=radio1/Free_as_the_wind&p=3173 \u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f]\u300b\u7bc0\u76ee\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba\u76e7\u5049\u529b\u3001\u99ac\u6069\u8cdc\u3001\u5609\u8cd3:\u6f58\u6b65\u91d7\u3001[[:zh-tw:\u962e\u5146\u8f1d|\u962e\u5146\u8f1d]]:\u5929\u5929\u4ee5\u53ca\u5834\u5834\u65b0\u9baefresh \uff0c\u6709\u5167\u6db5Connotation\u800c\u597d\u81ea\u7136natural \uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u53c8\u6709\u5149\u5f69luster \uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6c92\u6709\u65a7\u947f\u75d5\u8de1look effortless\u3002....'''\u4f62\u884c\u51fa\u569f\u5c31\u4fc2\u35ce\u5566\uff0c\u5187\u5f97\u6559\u35ce\u558e\u3002''' To capture attention the way like Loong can is not taught.

However, she did not take in pupils or students, if not for a fee, to elevate herself as many do in the Cantonese opera community. Instead, she called them \"young ladies\" in radio interview (Vancouver, BC) when three of them visited her to get some rehearsals and training done for the 2015/6 event. Loong sat idle waiting for rehearsals back when she worked with female leads who were being trained right in the middle of a rehearsal/review session. Having had those close encounters as a male lead on top of having been trained for other female roles herself performed, though few and far between because of the voice she has, Loong put all those years/months/days/hours of observations/trainings to good use. [[Cherie Chung]] is said to be a fan of Loong because of her (female role) performance in The Handsome Pan'an.\n\n===Excerpts of Cantonese opera by Lung Kim-sang===\nIn 2014,<ref>[http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/entertainment/20141231/bkn-20141231213144582-1231_00862_001.html \u300c\u4efb\u767d\u300d\u5f97\u610f\u9580\u751f\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19\uff08\u963f\u5228\uff09\u6f14\u51fa\u517125\u5834\u300a\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5\u300b\u6298\u5b50\u6232\u5713\u6eff\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u963f\u5228\u5728\u5c3e\u5834\u6dda\u6d78\u6232\u53f0\uff0c\u6559\u4eba\u52d5\u5bb9\u3002\u7206106\u6b72\u6bcd\u89aa\u9577\u58fd\u79d8\u8a23] \u3010on.cc\u6771\u7db2\u5c08\u8a0a\u3011 [http://www.macaodaily.com/html/2014-11/17/content_951764.htm \u5c0d\u5169\u4f4d\u5e74\u8f15\u82b1\u65e6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6b64\u4e43\u5929\u4e0a\u6389\u4e0b\u4f86\u3001\u5343\u8f09\u96e3\u9022\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u4e5f\uff01\u963f\u5228\u98a8\u91c7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203014501/http://www.macaodaily.com/html/2014-11/17/content_951764.htm |date=2014-12-03 }}\u3010\u6fb3\u9580\u65e5\u5831\u3011[http://ent.appledaily.com.tw/enews/article/entertainment/20141118/36213839 \u53f0\u8a9e\u570b\u5bf6x\u7cb5\u5287\u570b\u5bf6 \u6c5f\u8559\u9999\u6e2f\u4ea4\u6d41\u9f8d\u528d\u7b19] \u3010\u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831\u3011</ref> Loong, for the first time, shared stage with and opposite new \"love interests\" to commemorate the quarter of a century since the passing of her mentor Yam.

Loong shared the stage with the original cast in 1968/9 and then the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"\u85aa\u706b\u76f8\u50b3\">[http://operapreview.com/index.php/%E7%B6%B2%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%9C%E8%AA%8C/%E8%88%9E%E5%8F%B0%E5%82%B3%E7%9C%9F/item/464 \u6232\u66f2\u54c1\u5473\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b] \u4eca\u6b21\u6f14\u51fa\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b\u5168\u5287\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u8aaa\u662f\u85aa\u706b\u76f8\u50b3\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u8b93\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u770b\u770b\u548c\u611f\u53d7\u4e00\u4e0b\u5979\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u6f14\u7e79\uff0c\u6642\u9593\u6c38\u9060\u8d70\u5728\u524d\uff0c\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u4eba\u751f\u52a0\u6dfb\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u53c8\u4e00\u6bb5\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u56de\u61b6\u548c\u7121\u9650\u601d\u5ff5\u3002</ref>\n\n===The Peony Pavilion===\n[[The Peony Pavilion]] was one of the five titles mentor Yam shared the stage with Loong and classmates in 1968/69/70. Chu (1972 in orange dress) and Koi (1972 in green dress), instead of Loong, shared the two characters usually played by second male lead in this title. Chu was the '''''emperor''''' while Koi (1941\uff0d2007) was the '''''cousin'''''. They did not have much interaction with Yam on stage. (That may or may not be the reason, as an exception, Loong did not get to play these.) Chu talked about her own experience in an interview as to how to cope with '''''realizing the wrong name out of her mouth''''' and the mentor Yam who could deal with it.\n\nAnother highlight of this title is the major role of second female lead, originally (as well as in 68/69/70) played by Art Director Yam Bing Yee ([[:zh-tw:\u4efb\u51b0\u5152|\u4efb\u51b0\u5152]]), younger sister of mentor Yam. She was part of the main theme of original Act One in 1956 but not since. Audience was not patient to see the first and second female leads on stage for over half an hour before the character played by mentor Yam showed up. The third female lead, the younger '''''nun''''', had scripted interaction with mentor Yam but did not get good review.<sup>Issue#108/116/122</sup>{{efn-ua|name=fn11|50th Mark}}\n\nPutting full version of this title (Chinese: \u9f8d\u528d\u7b19 - \u7261\u4e39\u4ead\u9a5a\u5922\u5168\u5287) on stage in 2017/8 completed the 2014 event in remembrance of mentor Yam.\n\n===A Romance of Pear Blossoms===\nBeing the center of attention in that 1950s troupe at the ''make or break'' moment, Yam delivered and demonstrated her AAA on stage in 1957. Yam's performance over 60 years ago at debut of this title launched or saved the now only known career of her co-star and usual plus-one for decades.\n\nOnly two of the young performers who are in their early 30s and joined Loong in 2014 remain in her team of six pillars; Cheng Nga-ki as the female lead and Lai Yiu-wai (Keith) playing a character created by Lang Chi Bak.\n\nAlso, Wyborn Leung returns to play a character created by [[Leung Sing Bor]], third time in a row. Wyborn and Leung Sing Bor are not relatives but their physiques are very much alike. This is vital for the last few titles of [[Tang Ti-sheng]] who tailored the manuscripts to match the six pillars.\n\nWyborn's father, Leung Hon Wai who was a peer of Loong, worked closely with Leung Sing Bor for over a decade and talked about their regular trips to movie theaters on television. However, Wyborn was not raised to follow the path of a clown like Leung Sing Bor by his father who was very knowledgeable about that acting style, unlike those performers who took these roles only because they are fat and old. Neither did Wyborn have more than fat and old performers to guide him until Loong was looking for kids to work with a few years ago.\n\nThese are \"kids\" to Loong, the same way Yam called Loong and her classmates for years.\n\n===Di N\u00fc Hua===\n13 Shows (28 November - 14 December) in 2019 to commemorate 30 years (1989-2019) since the passing of mentor [[Yam Kim Fai]].\n\n===The Reincarnation of a Beauty===\nThe kids have yet to learn from Loong, the only surviving male lead who worked on stage (day in, day out) with both [[Leung Sing Bor]] and [[Lang Chi Bak]] in this last title of [[Tang Ti-sheng]]. Lang addressed Loong on stage as ''Mr. Pui'' (\u88f4\u751f) in Cantonese. That sounds very similar to Loong's birth name ''Pui Sang'' (\u83e9\u751f).\n\n==AAA on stage==\nAAA (art, acrobatics, acting) and stage presence, eye popping to Yam, described and compared to mentor Yam by Cantonese opera veterans and up-and-coming performers, as:\n\n#With grace or chic ([[:zh-tw:GQ|\u701f\u7051]]) and charm, take the stage (\u4eae\u76f8), ooze charisma and enchant their audiences.<ref name=\"\u8b1b\u6771\u8b1b\u897f20091210\"/><ref name=\"\u963f\u5228\u6f14\u7e79\u5e2b\u7236\u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u6d3e\u529f\u592b\uff0c\u513c\u5982\u5e2b\u7236\u4e0a\u8eab\u822c\">{{cite web|language=en|url=http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/entertainment/20160101/bkn-20160101152050007-0101_00862_001.html|title=\u300a\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u300b\u5168\u5287\u3000\u963f\u5228\u6f14\u7e79\u5e2b\u7236\u4efb\u528d\u8f1d\u6d3e\u529f\u592b\uff0c\u513c\u5982\u5e2b\u7236\u4e0a\u8eab\u822c|publisher=\u3010on.cc\u6771\u7db2\u5c08\u8a0a\u3011}}</ref><ref>1985 Radio broadcast [http://app4.rthk.hk/special/rthkmemory/details/profile/31 June 15], \u7d05\u4f36\u8a34\u5fc3\u8072\uff1a [[:zh-tw:\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f|\u975a\u6b21\u4f2f]], [[Lang Chi Bak]], the classmate of [[Sit Gok Sin]] and co-worker of both mentor and protegee at one point of their career.</ref><ref>[https://m.facebook.com/hammerout.hk/posts/983525905048208 \u9b45\u529b\u8001\u500c] [[\u660e\u5831]] \u300a\u5de6\u53f3\u98ef\u5c40\u300b[[:zh-tw:\u674e\u6167\u73b2|\u674e\u6167\u73b2]]</ref>\n#Loong's eyes (\u95dc\u76ee) [http://app4.rthk.hk/special/rthkmemory/details/artscritique/228 can talk], according to [[Loong Kim Sang#External links|Yip Shiu Tak,]] and communicate emotions to fellow performers and audiences, according to new \"love interests\".

This veteran shared the stage with both Loong (including 2014) and Yam (only once according to himself in 2009 TV interview).\n\nIn 1999, the 10th anniversary of passing of mentor Yam, Loong disclosed the first time on camera, Yam's rule of thumb, \"Be Natural\" (Chinese: \u81ea\u7136\u5c31\u662f\u7f8e).\"2015 Talk on the Rendition of Yam Kim Fai\", as just about all those have been speaking publicly since 1999, referred to this term first coined by Loong.\n\nAgain in 2013 to 2016, Loong shared more of her \"heritance\" with up-and-coming performers. For example, the new \"love interests\" were asked to study meticulously the manuscript and to memorize the lines before meeting Loong in September 2013 for rehearsals in Vancouver BC. Moreover, Loong suggested that studying beyond their own lines would give them an advantage on stage generally.\n\nNo painting the town red. As ethical standard, Loong instituted in them ''responsibility to stay warm/eat healthy'' and ''compete only by performance on stage''. (That was the manner Yam preferred, no fighting with classmates, per Chu, '''''\u6731 [https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8A%8D \u528d] \u4e39\u5e2b\u5085'''.)''\n\n==Accolades==\n===1990 Artists of the Year Awards in acting===\nLoong was awarded in 1990 the best actor's award by the Hong Kong Artists Alliance.\n\n===2016 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], DVD \"[[Zi Chai Ji (Quan Ju)]]\" '''\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18(\u5168\u5287)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-16/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2016|title=2016|website=www.ifpihk.org}}</ref>\n\n===2015 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], just received encouragement for her effort to remember her mentor [[Yam Kim Fai]] and pay-it-forward to bring up-and-coming performers onto stage in 2014.\n\nDVD of the event \"[[Ren Yi Sheng Hui Nian Long Qing]]\" ('''\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5'''), one of the '''2015 Best Sales Releases''', Classical and Operatic Works Recording, was '''live recording''' of 2014 stage production.<ref>\u4efb\u85dd\u7b19\u8f1d\u5ff5\u6fc3\u60c5 [http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-15/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2015 IFPI HKG 2015] List of Best Sales Releases, Classical and Operatic Works Recording (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts)</ref>\n\nLoong was one of \"'''Ten Best Sales Local Artistes'''\" (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts) for the third album after the award for two released in 2012.\n\n===2012 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], DVD \"[[Ren Qu Sheng Yun]]\" ('''[http://blogcity.me/blog/reply_blog_express.asp?f=O6UTGN1KPQ207828&id=519245 \u4efb\u66f2\u7b19\u97fb]''') and \"[[Long Qing Shi Yi Ban Shi Ji]]\" ('''\u9f8d\u60c5\u8a69\u610f\u534a\u4e16\u7d00''').<ref>[http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-11/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2012 IFPI HKG 2012, first year] List of Best Sales Releases, Classical and Operatic Works Recording (Order in Chinese Stroke Counts)</ref>\n\n===2011 IFPI awards===\nLoong, credited as [[Lung Kim Sheng]], was awarded The IFPI Hong Kong Award for Excellent Contribution to Cantonese Opera IFPI ('''\u9999\u6e2f\u7cb5\u5287\u8ca2\u737b\u5927\u734e''').<ref>[http://www.ifpihk.org/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented-01-11/hong-kong-top-sales-music-award-presented/2011 IFPI HKG 2011] The IFPI Hong Kong Award for Excellent Contribution to Cantonese Opera.</ref>\n\n===1982 Gold Disc award===\n[http://rthk.hk/chineseopera/opera30th/song_19.htm '''\u6d1e\u5ead\u5341\u9001''']<ref name=\"\u67f3\u6bc5\u50b3\u66f8\">[http://www.ifpihk.org/gold-disc-award-presented/1982 1982 Gold Disc Award]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-4}}\n\n===50th mark===\n\n'''\u300a\u6232\u66f2\u54c1\u5473\u6708\u520a\u300b'''\n\nissue 133 -

The particle prefix ''me(n)t-'' from the verb <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u03ef}}</big> ''moudi'' ('to speak') forms many abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to \"language\"). The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

Thus, the whole expression literally means 'language of the people of Egypt', or simply 'Egyptian language'.\n\nAnother name by which the language has been called is <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c9b\u0304\u2ca7\u2c95\u2ca9\u2ca1\u2ca7\u2c81\u2c93\u2c9f\u2c9b}}</big> ''/t\u0259m\u0259ntkuptaion/'' from the Copto-[[Greek language|Greek]] form <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c9b\u0304\u2ca7\u2c81\u2c93\u2c85\u2ca9\u2ca1\u2ca7\u2c93\u2c9f\u2c9b}}</big> ''/t\u0259m\u0259ntaigupton/'' ('Egyptian language'). The term ''logos \u0259n aiguptios'' ('Egyptian language') is also attested in Sahidic, but ''logos'' and ''aiguptios'' are both Greek in origin. In the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the name is more officially <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u2c81\u2ca5\u2ca1\u2c93 \u2c9b\u0300\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''tiaspi \u0259nrem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi'', 'the Egyptian language', <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2ca5\u2ca1\u2c93}}</big> ''aspi'' being the Egyptian word for language.\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n{{IPA notice}}\nCoptic is today spoken liturgically in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Catholic Church]] (along with [[Modern Standard Arabic]]). The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}. Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> is grammatically masculine and hence would have been vocalised ''pemsah'' or ''bemsah'' (Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>). Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u2ca7\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u03ef\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>).\n* ''\u1e6d\u016bbah'' {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0648\u0628\u0629}} \"brick\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014d\u014dbe}}; Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014dbi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].\n* ''w\u0101\u1e25ah'' {{lang|ar|\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629}} \"oasis\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u03e9\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouahe}}, Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c89\u03e9\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouehi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}\n\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|baare}}, \"small boat\".\n\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>[https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920 The Transition from Coptic to Arabic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |title=Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] |first= |date=September 2006 |publisher=KONDA |page=19 |format=PDF |chapter=Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue]}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sijpesteijn |first=Petra |title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt |last2=Lennart Sundelin |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13886-5 |location=Leiden, Boston}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward.

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular.

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}\n\n'''Absolute state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93 \u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijimi \u0259mpai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jimi \u0259m-p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Nominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99 \u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijem pai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=NOM:nominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jem p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Pronominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big> - ''Aij\u0259ntf''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=PRONOM:pronominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big>\n|a-i-j\u0259nt{{=}}f\n|PFV-1SG-find.PRONOM{{=}}3MSG\n|'I found him.'}}\n\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{Cite journal |last=Abel |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Abel |year=1855 |title=On the Coptic Language |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61 |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |issue=5 |ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".

Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

The particle prefix ''me(n)t-'' from the verb <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u03ef}}</big> ''moudi'' ('to speak') forms many abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to \"language\"). The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}. Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> is grammatically masculine and hence would have been vocalised ''pemsah'' or ''bemsah'' (Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>). Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u2ca7\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u03ef\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>).\n* ''\u1e6d\u016bbah'' {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0648\u0628\u0629}} \"brick\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014d\u014dbe}}; Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014dbi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].\n* ''w\u0101\u1e25ah'' {{lang|ar|\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629}} \"oasis\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u03e9\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouahe}}, Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c89\u03e9\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouehi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}\n\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|baare}}, \"small boat\".\n\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

However, Coptic [[reborrowing|reborrowed]] some words of Ancient Egyptian origin into its lexicon, via Greek.

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>[https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920 The Transition from Coptic to Arabic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |title=Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] |first= |date=September 2006 |publisher=KONDA |page=19 |format=PDF |chapter=Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue]}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sijpesteijn |first=Petra |title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt |last2=Lennart Sundelin |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13886-5 |location=Leiden, Boston}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward.

It's possible there was also a distinction between short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but if so the functional load was extremely low.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Sahidic stressed vowels\n!\n!

It's difficult to explain <\u03b7>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.\n\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are,\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Sahidic stressed vowels\n|\u03b1||\u03b1\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03bf||\u03c9||\u03c9\u03c9\n|-\n!Mesokemic equivalent\n|\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03b7||\u03b1||\u03bf||\u03c9\n|}\n\nIt's not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they're an imitation of the long Greek vowels <\u03b7, \u03c9>.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAs with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big>. <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> is transcribed as {{angle bracket|j}} in many older Coptic sources and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> as {{angle bracket|\u0261}}{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} or {{angle bracket|\u010d}}. {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}} notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[t\u02b2]}} and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[k\u02b2]}}. {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004|p=22}} suggests that <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}.\n\nThe following chart shows the consonants that are represented in Sahidic Coptic orthography.

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Proclitic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |As suffix\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n!

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}\n\n'''Absolute state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93 \u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijimi \u0259mpai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jimi \u0259m-p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Nominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99 \u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijem pai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=NOM:nominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jem p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Pronominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big> - ''Aij\u0259ntf''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=PRONOM:pronominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big>\n|a-i-j\u0259nt{{=}}f\n|PFV-1SG-find.PRONOM{{=}}3MSG\n|'I found him.'}}\n\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject. The future I {{IPA|/na/}} is a preverbal particle and follows the subject:{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=210}}\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5 \u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''Pecoeis nakrine \u0259nnelaos''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|Pe-coeis '''na'''-krine \u0259n-ne-laos\n|DEF:MASC:SG-lord FUT-judge PREP-DEF:PL-people\n|'The lord will judge the nations.'}}\n\nIn contrast, the perfective {{IPA|/a/}} is a pre-subject particle:\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80 \u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c87\u2c89 \u2c9f\u2c97 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''A tefs\u014dne de ol \u0259nnefk\u0113s''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c87\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2c97}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|'''A''' te-f-s\u014dne de ol \u0259n-ne-f-k\u0113s\n|PFV DEF:F:SG-3MSG-sister {{gcl|PART|particle}} carry.ABS PREP-DEF:PL-3MSG-bone\n|'His sister carried his bones.'}}\n\nThere is some variation in the labels for the tense/aspect/mood categories.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{Cite journal |last=Abel |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Abel |year=1855 |title=On the Coptic Language |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61 |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |issue=5 |ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".
