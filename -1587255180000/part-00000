The crime is still unsolved and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.\n\nThe police initially suspected that the ransom note had been written by JonBen\u00e9t's mother, and that the note and appearance of the child's body had been staged by her parents in order to cover up the crime.

In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 [[grand jury]] had recommended filing charges against JonBen\u00e9t's parents for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation.

From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than she. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director [[John Ford]]'s African-filmed adventure-romance ''[[Mogambo]]'', starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Ava Gardner]], which won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her deglamorized performance in the drama ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1954 Academy Awards: Winners and History |url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa54.html |website=AMC Filmsite}}</ref> Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), with [[Gary Cooper]]; the romance-comedy musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), with Bing Crosby and [[Frank Sinatra]]; and three [[Alfred Hitchcock]] suspense thrillers in rapid succession: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), with [[Ray Milland]]; ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), with [[James Stewart]]; and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), with [[Cary Grant]].  \n\nKelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess of Monaco]]. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. Kelly and Rainier had three children: [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline]], [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert]], and [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco|Princess St\u00e9phanie]].

Saint Bridget's was the East Falls parish where she was baptized and received her earliest education. Founded in 1853 by [[Saint John Neumann]], the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was at that time a relatively young parish, where families were very close to one another. While attending [[Ravenhill Academy]], a reputable Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in ''Don't Feed the Animals'', a play produced by the East Falls Old Academy Players.<ref name=\"leigh\" /> Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens School, a socially prominent private institution in nearby [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]], she acted and danced.

Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Leigh|2007|p=26}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nDespite her parents' initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\".{{r|jacobs201005}} To start her career, she auditioned for the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's ''The Torch-Bearers'' (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nKelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'', alongside [[Raymond Massey]]. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nTelevision producer [[Delbert Mann]] cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday in an adaptation of the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly 60 live television programs.{{r|jacobs201005}} As a theater personality, she was mentioned in ''Theatre World'' magazine as: \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950.\" Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: ''The Father'', ''The Rockingham Tea Set'', ''The Apple Tree'', ''The Mirror of Delusion'', ''Episode'' (for [[Somerset Maugham]]'s tele-serial), among others.{{sfn|Spoto|2010|pages = 51\u201352}}\n\nSuccess on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Impressed by her work in ''The Father'', the director of the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] film ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), [[Henry Hathaway]], offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role, opposite [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], as a young woman contemplating divorce.{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p = 954}} Kelly's co-artist Paul Douglas commented of her acting in this film: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side\u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental cooperative people in the business.\"{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}} Following the release of this film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established. It became popular all over the United States, with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}}\n\nKelly was noticed during a visit to the set of ''Fourteen Hours'' by [[Gary Cooper]], who subsequently starred with her in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). He was charmed by her, and said that she was \"different from all these sexballs we've been seeing so much of\". However, Kelly's performance in ''Fourteen Hours'' was not noticed by critics, and did not lead to her receiving other film acting roles.

From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than she. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director [[John Ford]]'s African-filmed adventure-romance ''[[Mogambo]]'', starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Ava Gardner]], which won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her deglamorized performance in the drama ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1954 Academy Awards: Winners and History |url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa54.html |website=AMC Filmsite}}</ref> Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), with [[Gary Cooper]]; the romance-comedy musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), with Bing Crosby and [[Frank Sinatra]]; and three [[Alfred Hitchcock]] suspense thrillers in rapid succession: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), with [[Ray Milland]]; ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), with [[James Stewart]]; and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), with [[Cary Grant]].  \n\nKelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess of Monaco]]. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. Kelly and Rainier had three children: [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline]], [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert]], and [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco|Princess St\u00e9phanie]].

Saint Bridget's was the East Falls parish where she was baptized and received her earliest education. Founded in 1853 by [[Saint John Neumann]], the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was at that time a relatively young parish, where families were very close to one another. While attending [[Ravenhill Academy]], a reputable Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in ''Don't Feed the Animals'', a play produced by the East Falls Old Academy Players.<ref name=\"leigh\" /> Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens School, a socially prominent private institution in nearby [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]], she acted and danced.

Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Leigh|2007|p=26}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nDespite her parents' initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\".{{r|jacobs201005}} To start her career, she auditioned for the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's ''The Torch-Bearers'' (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nKelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'', alongside [[Raymond Massey]]. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nTelevision producer [[Delbert Mann]] cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday in an adaptation of the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly 60 live television programs.{{r|jacobs201005}} As a theater personality, she was mentioned in ''Theatre World'' magazine as: \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950.\" Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: ''The Father'', ''The Rockingham Tea Set'', ''The Apple Tree'', ''The Mirror of Delusion'', ''Episode'' (for [[Somerset Maugham]]'s tele-serial), among others.{{sfn|Spoto|2010|pages = 51\u201352}}\n\nSuccess on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Impressed by her work in ''The Father'', the director of the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] film ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), [[Henry Hathaway]], offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role, opposite [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], as a young woman contemplating divorce.{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p = 954}} Kelly's co-artist Paul Douglas commented of her acting in this film: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side\u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental cooperative people in the business.\"{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}} Following the release of this film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established. It became popular all over the United States, with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}}\n\nKelly was noticed during a visit to the set of ''Fourteen Hours'' by [[Gary Cooper]], who subsequently starred with her in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). He was charmed by her, and said that she was \"different from all these sexballs we've been seeing so much of\".

As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days).

wrestling]] [[world tag team championship]] contested in [[WWE]] on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Xavier Woods]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 20 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at six, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at six. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

A [[Warfare Officer|warfare officer]] with a predominantly submarine background, he has served in a variety of diesel-electric and nuclear submarines, as well as undertaking a number of surface vessel and Staff appointments.\n\nHe was the first submariner to have completed the inaugural Specialist Navigation course, was awarded the Howard-Johnston Memorial Sword in 1993 and was the top student of his [[Submarine Command Course]] (\"Perisher\") in 1998. He was selected for promotion a year early to Lieutenant Commander in 1996, to Commander in 1999 and to Captain in 2007. He was promoted in post to Commodore in 2014, a year later to Rear Admiral and in 2019 to Vice Admiral.\n\nHe has a wide range of operational experience from tours in Northern Ireland, Kosovo and most recently Iraq in 2009, where as an Acting Commodore he was responsible for the reconstruction of the Iraqi Navy.\n\nHe previously commanded the patrol vessel [[HMS Blackwater|HMS ''Blackwater'']] during the period immediately prior to the Northern Ireland ceasefire in 1995, the first submariner to do so. As the Executive Officer of [[HMS Splendid (S106)|HMS ''Splendid'']] he fired the first Tomahawk missiles from a Royal Navy submarine during operations in Kosovo in 1999, and in Command of the nuclear attack submarine [[HMS Talent (S92)|HMS ''Talent'']] he conducted several specialist patrols throughout 1999-2000.

Ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of Theropoda by the early Jurassic, however, the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the Late Jurassic. According to the majority of the latest research, Ceratosauria includes the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', and ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', found primarily (though not exclusively) in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic [[Coelophysoidea]] and [[Dilophosauridae]], implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a [[clade|natural group]] with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carrano|first=Matthew T.|last2=Sampson|first2=Scott D.|date=2008-01-01|title=The Phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=183\u2013236|doi=10.1017/S1477201907002246|issn=1477-2019|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97ba4ba82753286ee9a105aeec4d97ec2d5fc585}}</ref>\n\nCeratosauria derives its names from the type species, ''[[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus nasicornis]]'', described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, ''Ceratosaurus nasicornis'', was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" />  Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurs]], whereas more basal species such as ''C. nasicornis'' appear more similar to other basal [[Theropoda|theropods]]. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record, means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\n\n=== Historical Phylogeny ===\nCeratosauria was first described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of ''C. nasicornis'' and those of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. Since ''C. nasicornis'' was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near ''Archaeopteryx'' and its related groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=O. C.|title=On the united metatarsal bones of Ceratosaurus.|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=s3-28|issue=164|pages=161\u2013162|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-28.164.161|year=1884|bibcode=1884AmJS...28..161M|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1450068}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the idea of the Ceratosauria was soon contested by Marsh's rival, [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. Cope argued that the taxon was invalid.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Dinosauria|last=...).|first=Weishampel, David B. (1952-|last2=Peter|first2=Dodson|last3=...).|first3=Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka, (1930-|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520242098|oclc=493366196}}</ref>  The idea of the Ceratosauria would regain some support more than thirty years later when Gilmore argued in its favor in 1920. Despite Gilmore's support, few species were added to the group following World War I, and little emphasis was placed on it. In fact, the scientific communities most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of [[Alfred Romer|Romer]], [[Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent|Lapparent]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lavocat|Lavocat]], [[Edwin H. Colbert|Colbert]], and [[Alan J. Charig|Charig]] amongst others.\n\nCeratosauria's fortune changed in 1986 when [[Jacques Gauthier]], in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or [[Tetanurae]]. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and [[Coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds|url=http://biostor.org/reference/110202|journal=Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=8|issn=0885-4629}}</ref>  Gauthier's paper brought Ceratosauria's use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]] had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids.\n\n=== Current Phylogeny ===\nMost paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior the middle Jurassic, and even in the middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]]. Several recent discoveries of possible ceratosaurs have begun reshaping the phylogeny of Ceratosauria by filling in some of these gaps. Specifically, this has allowed paleontologists to begin altering the sub-groups inside Ceratosauria, in an attempt to find their most basal members.\n\nCurrently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria divides into two sub groups, [[Ceratosauridae]] and [[Abelisaur]]oidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polotomy.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

Recently, Rauhut and Carrano have placed Elaphrosaurinae inside Noasauridae while simultaneously moving the previous noasaurs into Noasaurinae.<ref name=\":2\" />  Into their new Noasauridae, they have uniquely included ''[[Deltadromeus]]'' and ''[[Limusaurus]]''.\n\nThe oldest known ceratosaur currently described is ''[[Berberosaurus|Berberosaurus liassicus]]'' at 185 Ma. Some paleontologists believe that ''Berberosaurus'' ''liassicus'', is the most basal ceratosaur currently discovered as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allain|first=Ronan|last2=Tykoski|first2=Ronald|last3=Aquesbi|first3=Najat|last4=Jalil|first4=Nour-Eddine|last5=Monbaron|first5=Michel|last6=Russell|first6=Dale|last7=Taquet|first7=Philippe|date=2007-09-12|title=An abelisauroid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Jurassic of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and the radiation of ceratosaurs|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=610\u2013624|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[610:AADTFT]2.0.CO;2|issn=0272-4634|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/8145/files/monbaron_adt.pdf}}</ref>  The placement of ''B''.

Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astralagus and calcaneum.<ref name=\":1\" />  For less derived members of the group, such as ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of ''C. nasicornis'' was rather similar to the basal [[Theropoda|theropod]] mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary ''[[Allosaurus]]''. ''C. nasicornis'' had larger teeth than ''Allosaurus'', and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey. Abelisaurids, however, carried many of these defining traits to their extremes. Most abelisaurids had largely shortened forelimbs, with ''Carnotaurus'' having shrunk them further than any large theropod.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=Jos\u00e9|last2=Novas|first2=Fernando|last3=Coria|first3=Rodolfo|date=1990|title=Carnotaurus sastrei Bonaparte, the horned, lightly built carnosaur from the Middle Cretaceous of Patagonia.

Ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of Theropoda by the early Jurassic, however, the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the Late Jurassic. According to the majority of the latest research, Ceratosauria includes the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', and ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', found primarily (though not exclusively) in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic [[Coelophysoidea]] and [[Dilophosauridae]], implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a [[clade|natural group]] with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carrano|first=Matthew T.|last2=Sampson|first2=Scott D.|date=2008-01-01|title=The Phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=183\u2013236|doi=10.1017/S1477201907002246|issn=1477-2019|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97ba4ba82753286ee9a105aeec4d97ec2d5fc585}}</ref>\n\nCeratosauria derives its names from the type species, ''[[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus nasicornis]]'', described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, ''Ceratosaurus nasicornis'', was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" />  Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurs]], whereas more basal species such as ''C. nasicornis'' appear more similar to other basal [[Theropoda|theropods]]. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record, means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\n\n=== Historical Phylogeny ===\nCeratosauria was first described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of ''C. nasicornis'' and those of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. Since ''C. nasicornis'' was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near ''Archaeopteryx'' and its related groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=O.

In fact, the scientific communities most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of [[Alfred Romer|Romer]], [[Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent|Lapparent]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lavocat|Lavocat]], [[Edwin H. Colbert|Colbert]], and [[Alan J. Charig|Charig]] amongst others.\n\nCeratosauria's fortune changed in 1986 when [[Jacques Gauthier]], in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or [[Tetanurae]]. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and [[Coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds|url=http://biostor.org/reference/110202|journal=Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=8|issn=0885-4629}}</ref>  Gauthier's paper brought Ceratosauria's use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]] had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids.\n\n=== Current Phylogeny ===\nMost paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior the middle Jurassic, and even in the middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]]. Several recent discoveries of possible ceratosaurs have begun reshaping the phylogeny of Ceratosauria by filling in some of these gaps. Specifically, this has allowed paleontologists to begin altering the sub-groups inside Ceratosauria, in an attempt to find their most basal members.\n\nCurrently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria divides into two sub groups, [[Ceratosauridae]] and [[Abelisaur]]oidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polotomy.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astralagus and calcaneum.<ref name=\":1\" />  For less derived members of the group, such as ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of ''C. nasicornis'' was rather similar to the basal [[Theropoda|theropod]] mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary ''[[Allosaurus]]''. ''C. nasicornis'' had larger teeth than ''Allosaurus'', and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey.

''River City'' follows the lives of the people who live and work in the fictional district of Shieldinch.\n\nThe series is broadcast every Tuesday in an hour-long episode on [[BBC One Scotland]]. ''River City'' is not entered into the [[British Soap Awards]] as it is not broadcast throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 2017, a short crossover episode of the show was made for ''[[Children in Need]]'' and featured several of the show's characters meeting characters from Scottish sitcom ''[[Scot Squad]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/scot-squad-river-city-cin|title=Scot Squad and River City stars join forces for Children In Need mash-up with Pudsey|date=16 November 2017|work=Media Centre|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nRiver City is set in Shieldinch, a fictional district in the west end of [[Glasgow]], the largest city in [[Scotland]]. Shieldinch was founded in 1860 and was known for its shipyard (the local pub is named \"The Tall Ship\", which is a tribute to the areas's shipbuilding heritage). The name is derived from the real districts of [[Whiteinch]] and [[Shieldhall]], located on opposite banks of the [[River Clyde]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rfKqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&dq=shieldinch&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4wZXTnqTkAhUyrXEKHZipARcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=shieldinch&f=false|title=Media in Scotland|page=130|editor=Neil Blain |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780748631827}}</ref>\n\nFilming takes place on a set built specifically for the soap opera in the nearby town of [[Dumbarton]]. Other BBC programmes are filmed on the same set during the summer months, including ''[[Still Game]]'', ''[[Millie Inbetween]]'' and ''[[Shetland (TV series)|Shetland]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of River City characters}}\nThe storylines featured in ''River City'' are based on personal relationships and family life. Community involvement and the ability to come to terms with family issues, distress, and disagreements contribute to the development of each character. One of the original families that River City had been centered on was the Hamilton family that included [[Malcolm Hamilton (River City)|Malcolm Hamilton]]; his daughters; Eileen Donachie, formally called Eileen Henderson; [[Gina Hamilton]], previously known as Gina Buchanan; Gina's daughters; [[Ruth Rossi]]; Green; and [[Joanne Rossi]]. Another family that was integral to River City was the Hendersons. Both of these families have grown as the show has gone on. Eileen had two children, Kirsty and Brian, with her husband Raymond, as well as a stepdaughter Hazel who was her second husband Tommy's daughter from a previous marriage. She later had another son, Stuart, with Raymond that happened by chance. Joannne Rossi's son Franco and Ruth Rossi's daughter Ellie also became part of the show.\n\nThe Hamilton and Adams-Mullen families were the main focus of the plot for several ''River City'' storylines. The Hamiltons played centre stage from the drama's beginnings in 2002, and the Adams\u2013Mullen families from around 2003. Around the start of 2007, the storylines were based around the recently integrated Murdoch clan. In the year 2008 a new couple, the McKees, had been brought into the show when they made a new home in Shieldinch, giving them a big part in several storylines focused on their lives outside Shieldinch and the challenges of coming to a new town. As well as this, 2009 saw the introduction of the students and the hairdressers, consisting of father, daughter and two stylists.\nThe current longest serving character is Bob O'Hara, played by Stephen Purdon who has appeared since Episode 1. He is the longest serving character since Deirdre Davis' (Eileen Donachie) exit in May 2016 (who had also appeared since Episode 1). Sally Howit who plays Scarlett O'Hara is the longest serving female character having appeared since 2003.\n\n==Storylines==\n===2002===\nThe series begins on 24 September 2002 with the wedding of Eileen and Tommy Donachie, who then own the local Tall Ship public house. Eileen's ex-husband (and father of her two children) turns up on her wedding day, apparently unhappy; so is Eileen's old flame, Lewis Cope, who turns up in Shieldinch. Gina Rossi's daughter Joanne has an affair with Cormac (her sister Ruth's partner), who becomes an enemy of Lewis and many others. Eileen has a sordid affair with Lewis, which ends her marriage to Tommy. The underage Kirsty Henderson has a relationship with Russ (angering her father, Raymond). Derek Henderson's mother, Alice, returns after a sixteen-year absence; George, Derek's grandfather, had paid Alice to leave him for good and raised Derek. Although Joanne falls for Nazir Malik (leading to heartache), Shieldinch has a happy Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2002_gallery&photo=image1 |title=River City \u2013 Photo Galleries |publisher=BBC |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306112041/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2002_gallery&photo=image1 |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nTommy is killed by the Shieldinch Strangler, who becomes a recurring character. Revenge became a big part of everyone's lives as an abrupt Ewan injects Lewis with heroin for revenge, and Lewis becomes HIV positive. Shellsuit Bob declares his love for Zara Malik (who has been racially bullied), but their relationship is short-lived. Although Joanne's relationship with Nazir fails, she has his child (a boy) and names him Franco after her late father. Jealous of her husband's relationships with other women, Helen kidnaps Franco twice; the second time, Ewan talks her out of committing suicide with the baby. Gina discovers that Dr. Marcus McKenzie (her new love interest) is a rapist, and becomes one of his victims. Marcus also attempts to rape Heather Bellshaw, who kills him (although Gina's daughter, Joanne, is a suspect). Hazel is kidnapped by the mentally-ill Brian Henderson, who has become obsessed with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2003_gallery&photo=image1 |title=River City \u2013 Photo Galleries |publisher=BBC |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324224018/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2003_gallery&photo=image1 |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2004===\nBrian worsens. He takes his grandmother, Moira, for a joyride and kills her; this draws attention to his mental state. Hazel (kidnapped by Brian) is rescued by Vader, and they fall in love. Trouble begins between Billy Davies and Lewis Cope when Billy loses a poker bet of a night with his wife, Della, to Lewis.

Lenny trusts lawyer Ellie Gunn with Cal's trust fund.\n\nGabriel leaves Shieldinch when Nicole returns and says that she did not do as well as she thought she would. Dan offers Zinnie a one-year internship with Peace Doctors in Nepal; unsure what to do, Angus tries to persuade her to stay. Stevie has doubts about fatherhood and a lifetime with Stella.

Realising what has happened, he orders Caitlin out of the car and tells everyone to keep back. Zinnie, coming out of her flat and unable to react in time, is fatally injured in the explosion. She tells Angus she is sorry before she dies, but he is unsure of what she is apologising for. Lenny is also rushed to hospital and has a heart attack due to his MS, but is stable.

''River City'' follows the lives of the people who live and work in the fictional district of Shieldinch.\n\nThe series is broadcast every Tuesday in an hour-long episode on [[BBC One Scotland]]. ''River City'' is not entered into the [[British Soap Awards]] as it is not broadcast throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 2017, a short crossover episode of the show was made for ''[[Children in Need]]'' and featured several of the show's characters meeting characters from Scottish sitcom ''[[Scot Squad]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/scot-squad-river-city-cin|title=Scot Squad and River City stars join forces for Children In Need mash-up with Pudsey|date=16 November 2017|work=Media Centre|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nRiver City is set in Shieldinch, a fictional district in the west end of [[Glasgow]], the largest city in [[Scotland]]. Shieldinch was founded in 1860 and was known for its shipyard (the local pub is named \"The Tall Ship\", which is a tribute to the areas's shipbuilding heritage). The name is derived from the real districts of [[Whiteinch]] and [[Shieldhall]], located on opposite banks of the [[River Clyde]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rfKqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&dq=shieldinch&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4wZXTnqTkAhUyrXEKHZipARcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=shieldinch&f=false|title=Media in Scotland|page=130|editor=Neil Blain |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780748631827}}</ref>\n\nFilming takes place on a set built specifically for the soap opera in the nearby town of [[Dumbarton]]. Other BBC programmes are filmed on the same set during the summer months, including ''[[Still Game]]'', ''[[Millie Inbetween]]'' and ''[[Shetland (TV series)|Shetland]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of River City characters}}\nThe storylines featured in ''River City'' are based on personal relationships and family life. Community involvement and the ability to come to terms with family issues, distress, and disagreements contribute to the development of each character. One of the original families that River City had been centered on was the Hamilton family that included [[Malcolm Hamilton (River City)|Malcolm Hamilton]]; his daughters; Eileen Donachie, formally called Eileen Henderson; [[Gina Hamilton]], previously known as Gina Buchanan; Gina's daughters; [[Ruth Rossi]]; Green; and [[Joanne Rossi]]. Another family that was integral to River City was the Hendersons. Both of these families have grown as the show has gone on. Eileen had two children, Kirsty and Brian, with her husband Raymond, as well as a stepdaughter Hazel who was her second husband Tommy's daughter from a previous marriage. She later had another son, Stuart, with Raymond that happened by chance. Joannne Rossi's son Franco and Ruth Rossi's daughter Ellie also became part of the show.\n\nThe Hamilton and Adams-Mullen families were the main focus of the plot for several ''River City'' storylines. The Hamiltons played centre stage from the drama's beginnings in 2002, and the Adams\u2013Mullen families from around 2003. Around the start of 2007, the storylines were based around the recently integrated Murdoch clan. In the year 2008 a new couple, the McKees, had been brought into the show when they made a new home in Shieldinch, giving them a big part in several storylines focused on their lives outside Shieldinch and the challenges of coming to a new town. As well as this, 2009 saw the introduction of the students and the hairdressers, consisting of father, daughter and two stylists.\nThe current longest serving character is Bob O'Hara, played by Stephen Purdon who has appeared since Episode 1. He is the longest serving character since Deirdre Davis' (Eileen Donachie) exit in May 2016 (who had also appeared since Episode 1). Sally Howit who plays Scarlett O'Hara is the longest serving female character having appeared since 2003.\n\n==Storylines==\n===2002===\nThe series begins on 24 September 2002 with the wedding of Eileen and Tommy Donachie, who then own the local Tall Ship public house. Eileen's ex-husband (and father of her two children) turns up on her wedding day, apparently unhappy; so is Eileen's old flame, Lewis Cope, who turns up in Shieldinch. Gina Rossi's daughter Joanne has an affair with Cormac (her sister Ruth's partner), who becomes an enemy of Lewis and many others. Eileen has a sordid affair with Lewis, which ends her marriage to Tommy. The underage Kirsty Henderson has a relationship with Russ (angering her father, Raymond). Derek Henderson's mother, Alice, returns after a sixteen-year absence; George, Derek's grandfather, had paid Alice to leave him for good and raised Derek. Although Joanne falls for Nazir Malik (leading to heartache), Shieldinch has a happy Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2002_gallery&photo=image1 |title=River City \u2013 Photo Galleries |publisher=BBC |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306112041/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2002_gallery&photo=image1 |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nTommy is killed by the Shieldinch Strangler, who becomes a recurring character. Revenge became a big part of everyone's lives as an abrupt Ewan injects Lewis with heroin for revenge, and Lewis becomes HIV positive. Shellsuit Bob declares his love for Zara Malik (who has been racially bullied), but their relationship is short-lived. Although Joanne's relationship with Nazir fails, she has his child (a boy) and names him Franco after her late father. Jealous of her husband's relationships with other women, Helen kidnaps Franco twice; the second time, Ewan talks her out of committing suicide with the baby. Gina discovers that Dr. Marcus McKenzie (her new love interest) is a rapist, and becomes one of his victims. Marcus also attempts to rape Heather Bellshaw, who kills him (although Gina's daughter, Joanne, is a suspect). Hazel is kidnapped by the mentally-ill Brian Henderson, who has become obsessed with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2003_gallery&photo=image1 |title=River City \u2013 Photo Galleries |publisher=BBC |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324224018/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/photos/?gallery=2003_gallery&photo=image1 |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2004===\nBrian worsens. He takes his grandmother, Moira, for a joyride and kills her; this draws attention to his mental state. Hazel (kidnapped by Brian) is rescued by Vader, and they fall in love. Trouble begins between Billy Davies and Lewis Cope when Billy loses a poker bet of a night with his wife, Della, to Lewis.

Bob falls in love with Michelle and her baby, Rochelle. Eileen has another affair with Archie Buchanan, her sister's partner.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron). The town was sometimes referred to as La Belle City, a [[franglais]] interpretation of \"The Beautiful City\".<ref name=\"Andrews 1897\">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=J.H. |title=Centennial Souvenir of Steubenville and Jefferson County Ohio 1797\u20131897 |publisher=Herald Publishing Company |year=1897 |location=Steubenville, OH}}</ref>\n\nOn July 29, 1797, [[Jefferson County, Ohio|Jefferson County]] was organized by a proclamation of Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]], and Steubenville was selected as the County seat and was [[plat]]ted in the same year by Bezaliel (Bezaleel) Wells and [[James Ross (Pennsylvania congressman)|James Ross]], the city's co-founders.

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

In 2009, the college expanded its service district by three Ohio counties, and was renamed again: [[Eastern Gateway Community College]].\n\nThe city gained international attention in late 2012 from the events surrounding the [[Steubenville High School rape case]], which occurred in August 2012. The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013. The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html|title=CNN, Fox News, MSNBC Air Name of Steubenville Rape Victim|date=March 18, 2013|last=Fung|first=Katherine|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=nyt20121217>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Rape Case Unfolds on Web and Splits City |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2012|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Macur|first2=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSteubenville is located at {{coord|40|21|30|N|80|37|0|W|type:city}} (40.359, \u221280.614).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The city lies along the [[Ohio River]], with the city spreading west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city.

Corporations such as [[Weirton Steel]] have had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe new Findlay Connector has been built in western [[Pennsylvania]] as a toll-access highway between [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] at [[Interstate 376]] and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]].

Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the [[Seven Ranges]] of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAdjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Ohio Valley Steelworker\" Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the [[Ohio Valley]] [[Steelworkers]].

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets (at $85 each) were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013.

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets (at $85 each) were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue. On November 8, 2006, city residents voted to end the city's speed camera program with a 76.2 percent majority.<ref>\"Steubenville, Ohio Voters Overwhelmingly Reject Speed Cameras.\" 8 November 2006. theNewspaper. 8 November 2006 [http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/14/1433.asp].</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Wells High School (Steubenville) 1911.jpg|thumb|right|Wells High School, 1911]]\n===Colleges and universities===\nSteubenville is home to two institutions of higher education.
