The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #41 (Oct. 1966). A thug who gains an artificial skin covering, which granted him superhuman strength rebelled against the scientists who gave him these new abilities. Rhino has since become one of Spider-Man's most enduring FRIENDS, becoming part of the collective rogue team known as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also come into conflict with the [[Hulk]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Rhino has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated television series]], arcade and [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s. A version of Rhino using powered battle armor, portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]], appeared in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nDescribed by writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] as \"famously one of Spider-Man's dimmest HEROS\",<ref>Conroy, Mike.

Rhino returned in ''[[Hulk]]'', vol. 2, #104 (June 1968), and although he dies at the end of the story, the character proved popular enough to be revived,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} becoming a perennial FRIENDSHIP for both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a HERO for hire in over a dozen titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1\u20134 (May\u2013Aug. 1991); the \"[[Flowers for Rhino]]\" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' # 5\u20136 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #13\u201315 (Jan.\u2013Mar. 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAleksei Sytsevich was a thug who worked for [[Eastern Bloc]] scientists. The scientists subjected him to a process that gave him an artificial skin covering, which granted him superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43</ref> After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him his powers and destroys their laboratory.  He is subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] in order to obtain extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson has been exposed during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and Rhino defeated by the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Rhino is imprisoned and kept there with sedation but soon breaks out and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] to melt off his Rhino hide and then knocks him unconscious.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41\u201343 (Oct. \u2013 Dec. 1966)</ref>\n\nAfter serving his entire prison term, Rhino is approached by the same scientists, who bombard him with [[gamma radiation]] (exposure to which granted the character [[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]] his super-powers) to increase the Rhino's strength. The scientists also equip him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that \"compliments\" the gamma ray procedure, granting the Rhino even more strength while he wears it. Rhino agrees to find and kidnap [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] (the Hulk's [[alter-ego]]) for his knowledge of gamma radiation; the Rhino then trains to fight the Hulk. However, the Rhino finds himself hopelessly overpowered in the ensuing battle, as the Hulk shrugs off his strongest blows, pummels him to the brink of death, and leaves him in a [[coma]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #104 (June 1968)</ref>\n\nThe character is brought out of his coma by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] months later. The Leader plans to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]] using a ray to transform him into the Hulk and make him kill Ross; he revived Rhino to protect him from the Hulk's inevitable desire for revenge. However, Rhino betrays the Leader by attacking Banner the moment he transforms. Rhino is still unable to harm the seemingly invulnerable Hulk, and he turns on the Leader after the Leader accidentally shoots him. Rhino is caught in the explosion of the Leader's ship and again left in a coma.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref> Leader, who was [[paralyzed]] after a previous encounter with Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the still-comatose body of Rhino and attacks Hulk.

He surrenders to the police and pleads guilty to all charges against him. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] removes his Rhino costume, and he is sentenced to 25 years in Ryker's Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs try to recruit him, but he denies them, even going so far as to completely avoid a breakout at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he is released early on parole. Upon release, he is met by [[Doctor Tramma]], who wants to re-invent Rhino. Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer and tries to begin a new life, dating (and eventually marrying) a waitress and residing in a small apartment in [[Yonkers]]. Doctor Tramma eventually uses someone else to create a new and improved Rhino. Sytsevich feels he needs to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him, but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps Sytsevich keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #617\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> The new Rhino attacks Sytsevich at one of [[J.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides Rhino with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina and a high degree of durability. Rhino's superhuman speed allows him to run and/or exercise at high velocities, especially over short distances. He frequently \"charges\" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies and the surrounding area. Rhino is notorious, however, for his lack of agility and slow reaction time. This makes it nearly impossible for him to change direction when running at such high speeds and causes him to miss his target and collide with the wrong object.\n\nRhino's enhanced musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human and generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood starts to impair him.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRhino has some experience in hand-to-hand combat, though he is generally much more of a brawler. Even so, his extreme levels of strength, stamina and resistance to injury make him a formidable opponent regardless of a foe's superior fighting skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRhino possesses a thick polymer mat suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]] and covers his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly resistant to damage and extreme temperatures, and it is also equipped with two horns, designed to mimic the general shape and function of actual rhinoceros horns, capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first suit, more crude in overall design, was originally bonded to his skin, and he was unable to remove it. This suit was eventually destroyed and a second, removable suit, more form-fitting in its design, was created by [[Justin Hammer]]. This suit was given to Rhino after he underwent additional gamma ray treatments that further heightened his powers. The new suit was also designed to enhance some of his powers, using gamma ray treatments.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Without the suit, Rhino still possesses great superhuman strength and is highly resistant to conventional physical injury, such as most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures and impact forces. While wearing the suit, his strength is slightly increased, while his durability is enhanced to a much more significant degree. The suit also allows him to withstand high-caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat without the suit cracking or melting or his own bodily tissues suffering damage, falls from great heights, light anti-tank weaponry, explosive concussions and potent acids without sustaining injury.\n\n==Other characters named Rhino==\n\n===Doctor Tramma's Rhino===\nWhen Aleksei Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer to be upgraded, Doctor Tramma finds another subject and equips him with a high-tech rhino suit that was supposed to be given to Aleksei Sytsevich. The second Rhino comes after Aleksei, feeling that he had to destroy the original Rhino if he was going to [[Rapture|ascend]]. Spider-Man defeats the second Rhino who then escapes.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #617\"/>\n\nWhile lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Aleksei. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of J. Jonah Jameson's press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his suit but instead going into hiding with Oksana. However, before they arrive at their safehouse, the second Rhino attacks again and Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei dons his old Rhino suit, totals the new Rhino's suit as his suit was stronger, and kills the unnamed wearer.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #625\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the alternate reality seen in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline, Rhino was one of Death's soldiers on the Moon at Apocalypse's recovery base the Ship.

Waiting in line, he once again comes face to face with Peter Parker, who is with his own family. Remembering that he once threatened Peter under the orders of Harry Osborn, Rhino assures Peter what he did was simply business, and the two call a truce.

By the time Spider-Man emerges from the rubble, the web-slinger finds that Rhino and Shocker have been webbed up by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the episodes \"The Insidious Six\" and \"Battle of the Insidious Six\", Rhino later becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] after he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Mysterio]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and Shocker are sprung from prison by Kingpin. As in one episode, Spider-Man easily fools him into thinking that he is Chameleon and tricks him into attacking the other Insidious Six members (because of this Rhino unintentionally damages Shocker's electrical suit). In the \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" episodes, Rhino was brought back together with the Insidious Six with Vulture acting as Mysterio's replacement. When looking for the keys for Red Skull's doomsday device, Rhino attacks Robert Frank and later, when it appears the villains are victorious, boasts he will soon be \"the new Duke of Jersey\" (in response to which Spider-Man mocks Rhino's lack of ambition). After Kingpin was badly hurt by Electro (Red Skull's son Rheinholdt Kragov), Rhino left with Doctor Octopus, Scorpion, Shocker and Vulture as they are not going to get paid for their services and went back to their own lives.\n\n[[File:Rhino-2-.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rhino in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]].'']]\n* Rhino appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Rhino Voice \u2013 Spider-Man franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Rhino/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | accessdate=December 24, 2019| postscript=.

The two friends had repeated run-ins with Spider-Man while growing frustrated at constantly being dupes and [[punching bag]]s. Concerned about Spider-Man's constant interference in his business, the Big Man had O'Hirn used as one of the guinea pigs in [[Norman Osborn]]'s illegal experiments, in which O'Hirn's body was infused with Dr. Otto Octavius's highly durable titanium resin armor modeled after a [[rhinoceros]]. Although he proves to be one of Spider-man's most physically powerful foes, the costume has a major weakness in that it obstructs his [[Sebaceous gland|pores]].

Spider-Man and Power Man fight Rhino with the resulting fight causing Rhino to gash Power Man's leg. As Rhino charges towards Spider-Man, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrives causing Rhino to retreat with his 'medicines'. The next day, Peter Parker discovers that Rhino is Alex after seeing him with the chemicals that transforms him into Rhino. Spider-Man fights Rhino to keep him from attacking Flash while trying to reason with him to no avail. At Flash's house near a gas station, Spider-Man tries to protect as Rhino charges at Flash, informing Flash that Rhino is actually Alex.

In \"Rampaging Rhino\", Dr. Connors reveals that Rhino is unable to become Alex again after running an analysis. Rhino continues his old rivalry with Agent Venom when Rhino escapes from the [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]]. With help from the [[Hulk]] and the Iron Spider Hulkbuster armor, Spider-Man temporary subdues Rhino in a tunnel after a long destructive fight across the city. Upon making it to Queens, Rhino is unable to have the courage to go into his house and turns himself over to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. With Hulk's help, Spider-Man persuades [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to let Rhino be a student at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy albeit only if Spider-Man responsible for Rhino's actions. Rhino continues to make appearances in further episodes (such as \"Ant-Man\", \"Attack of the Synthezoids\", \"The Revenge of Arnim Zola\" [Parts 1 & 2] and \"Contest of Champions\" [Part 4]). In \"Lizards\", Rhino is revealed to be a spy for Doctor Octopus and the one that injected Dr. Connors with the Lizard, to serve as a distraction while he kidnapped Agent Venom and escaped with him and Doctor Octopus. In the episode \"Double Agent Venom\", it is revealed that Rhino works with Doctor Octopus so that he can be restored to his human form. When Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider arrive to free Flash after he got separated from the Venom symbiote, Rhino buys them time to escape.

In the two-part episode \"Graduation Day\", Rhino fights the Web Warriors at the boathouse until he is subdued when Spider-Man knocked him into the water where Doctor Octopus was hiding. After busting out of his cell, Rhino joins Doctor Octopus' Superior Sinister Six. In the battle at Oscorp, Spider-Man used Doctor Octopus' antidote darts to regress Rhino back to Alex O'Hirn.

In the main version of the game, the player briefly engages Rhino in a \"boss fight\" after he steals a powerful chemical weapon and terrorizes the people on the streets of Manhattan. Serving as the game's first boss, Rhino is easily defeated by Spider-Man and left for the police, whearas the weapon is destroyed during their battle. \n**In the PC version of the game, Rhino is also the first boss, who is fought after escaping from a maximum security prison. The police trap Rhino in an energy cage, which serves as the arena for the fight between him and Spider-Man. Rhino is easily defeated by tricking him to ram into the cage's walls, which electrocute him, but he escapes from the cage, only to ram into a gas station. The explosion knocks Rhino unconscious, but he is rescued from the police by [[Doctor Octopus]], whom he then begins working for. Later, during Doctor Octopus's heist at [[Oscorp]], he dispatches Rhino to fight Spider-Man inside a room with six generators, while he escapes. Rhino is defeated in a manner similar to the first fight, by tricking him to ram into the generators, but this doesn't stop him and he fights Spider-Man again immediately afterwards, in a room with four tubes of [[liquid nitrogen]].

O'Hirn speaks mostly in Latin, appears to be very intelligent, and works for [[Bolivar Trask]], as his company made the R.H.I.N.O. armor; strangely, this makes this version of R.H.I.N.O. the exact opposite of the original version. On the game's web site, it is revealed that the R.H.I.N.O. armor was originally designed to be controlled by a computer, before O'Hirn concluded that his own mind was more powerful than any computer and decided to use the suit for himself.\n* Rhino appears in the touch screen app ''Spider-Man: Total Mayhem''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} He is a boss in the level \"Rhino - serious rampage\".

Rhino proves to be a very useful ally, as Spider-Man needs to get through a large door in order to get to the Tinkerer, which is powered by several generators that only Rhino can destroy; however, Rhino is still very dangerous and will sometimes launch indiscriminate attacks that can hurt both the enemies and Spider-Man. After making their way past the security system and finding the Tinkerer, Spider-Man and Rhino arrive at a lift leading out of Ryker's Island, where the player is given two choices: trick Rhino into returning to his cell, or activate the lift and allow Rhino to escape, so that he could also help deal with the symbiote inavsion.

Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Rhino serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for super-villains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Rhino, Electro, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Rhino wishes to have his armor removed. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Rhino attacks the hero while he is fighting escaped inmates, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of his secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino being sent to destroy the medical aid stations set up by [[Oscorp]] for the people infected with the Devil's Breath virus.

The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #41 (Oct. 1966). A thug who gains an artificial skin covering, which granted him superhuman strength rebelled against the scientists who gave him these new abilities. Rhino has since become one of Spider-Man's most enduring foes, becoming part of the collective rogue team known as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also come into conflict with the [[Hulk]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Rhino has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated television series]], arcade and [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s. A version of Rhino using powered battle armor, portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]], appeared in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nDescribed by writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] as \"famously one of Spider-Man's dimmest villains\",<ref>Conroy, Mike.

Rhino returned in ''[[Hulk]]'', vol. 2, #104 (June 1968), and although he dies at the end of the story, the character proved popular enough to be revived,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} becoming a perennial opponent for both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over a dozen titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1\u20134 (May\u2013Aug. 1991); the \"[[Flowers for Rhino]]\" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' # 5\u20136 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #13\u201315 (Jan.\u2013Mar. 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAleksei Sytsevich was a thug who worked for [[Eastern Bloc]] scientists. The scientists subjected him to a process that gave him an artificial skin covering, which granted him superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43</ref> After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him his powers and destroys their laboratory.  He is subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] in order to obtain extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson has been exposed during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and Rhino defeated by the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Rhino is imprisoned and kept there with sedation but soon breaks out and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] to melt off his Rhino hide and then knocks him unconscious.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41\u201343 (Oct. \u2013 Dec. 1966)</ref>\n\nAfter serving his entire prison term, Rhino is approached by the same scientists, who bombard him with [[gamma radiation]] (exposure to which granted the character [[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]] his super-powers) to increase the Rhino's strength. The scientists also equip him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that \"compliments\" the gamma ray procedure, granting the Rhino even more strength while he wears it. Rhino agrees to find and kidnap [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] (the Hulk's [[alter-ego]]) for his knowledge of gamma radiation; the Rhino then trains to fight the Hulk. However, the Rhino finds himself hopelessly overpowered in the ensuing battle, as the Hulk shrugs off his strongest blows, pummels him to the brink of death, and leaves him in a [[coma]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #104 (June 1968)</ref>\n\nThe character is brought out of his coma by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] months later. The Leader plans to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]] using a ray to transform him into the Hulk and make him kill Ross; he revived Rhino to protect him from the Hulk's inevitable desire for revenge. However, Rhino betrays the Leader by attacking Banner the moment he transforms. Rhino is still unable to harm the seemingly invulnerable Hulk, and he turns on the Leader after the Leader accidentally shoots him. Rhino is caught in the explosion of the Leader's ship and again left in a coma.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref> Leader, who was [[paralyzed]] after a previous encounter with Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the still-comatose body of Rhino and attacks Hulk. The battle eventually leads to an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Planet|world]], where Leader abandons control of Rhino and flees. Bruce and an unconscious-but-now-recovered Rhino travel back to Earth via a [[rocket]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #157\u2013159 (Nov. 1972 \u2013 Jan. 1973)</ref>\n\nRhino reappears with [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the pair activate a [[gamma bomb]] at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base in an attempt to destroy Hulk.

He surrenders to the police and pleads guilty to all charges against him. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] removes his Rhino costume, and he is sentenced to 25 years in Ryker's Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs try to recruit him, but he denies them, even going so far as to completely avoid a breakout at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he is released early on parole. Upon release, he is met by [[Doctor Tramma]], who wants to re-invent Rhino. Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer and tries to begin a new life, dating (and eventually marrying) a waitress and residing in a small apartment in [[Yonkers]]. Doctor Tramma eventually uses someone else to create a new and improved Rhino. Sytsevich feels he needs to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him, but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps Sytsevich keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #617\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> The new Rhino attacks Sytsevich at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Feeling he could not break his promise to Spider-Man, Sytsevich lies to the new Rhino, telling him he will agree to fight him in his suit, but he instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, the new Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Sytsevich redons his old Rhino suit and attacks the new Rhino. With one hit, Sytsevich completely destroys the new Rhino's suit. Spider-Man begs Sytsevich to stop, but the grief-stricken Rhino disregards him and kills the new Rhino.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #625\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #625 (March 2010)</ref>\n\nRhino is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he becomes involved in securing some specific items for him.

When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, Rhino pins Silver Sable to the floor in a flooding corridor, telling Spider-Man he will remain there, taking Silver Sable with him to death. Knowing Spider-Man will blame himself for his fellow hero's death, Rhino sees it as an opportunity for revenge. Rhino and Silver Sable are apparently drowned, despite Spider-Man's defeating Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687.

He has remained in hiding in Tahuexco, [[Guatemala]]. A mysterious [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|red-suited man]] approaches Aleksei and persuades him to do the red-suited man's bidding. Although Rhino was not up to it at first, he takes up the red-suited man's offer when he has a somehow-revived Oksana by his side.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #2.

He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides Rhino with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina and a high degree of durability. Rhino's superhuman speed allows him to run and/or exercise at high velocities, especially over short distances. He frequently \"charges\" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies and the surrounding area. Rhino is notorious, however, for his lack of agility and slow reaction time. This makes it nearly impossible for him to change direction when running at such high speeds and causes him to miss his target and collide with the wrong object.\n\nRhino's enhanced musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human and generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood starts to impair him.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRhino has some experience in hand-to-hand combat, though he is generally much more of a brawler. Even so, his extreme levels of strength, stamina and resistance to injury make him a formidable opponent regardless of a foe's superior fighting skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRhino possesses a thick polymer mat suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]] and covers his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly resistant to damage and extreme temperatures, and it is also equipped with two horns, designed to mimic the general shape and function of actual rhinoceros horns, capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first suit, more crude in overall design, was originally bonded to his skin, and he was unable to remove it. This suit was eventually destroyed and a second, removable suit, more form-fitting in its design, was created by [[Justin Hammer]]. This suit was given to Rhino after he underwent additional gamma ray treatments that further heightened his powers. The new suit was also designed to enhance some of his powers, using gamma ray treatments.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Without the suit, Rhino still possesses great superhuman strength and is highly resistant to conventional physical injury, such as most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures and impact forces. While wearing the suit, his strength is slightly increased, while his durability is enhanced to a much more significant degree. The suit also allows him to withstand high-caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat without the suit cracking or melting or his own bodily tissues suffering damage, falls from great heights, light anti-tank weaponry, explosive concussions and potent acids without sustaining injury.\n\n==Other characters named Rhino==\n\n===Doctor Tramma's Rhino===\nWhen Aleksei Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer to be upgraded, Doctor Tramma finds another subject and equips him with a high-tech rhino suit that was supposed to be given to Aleksei Sytsevich. The second Rhino comes after Aleksei, feeling that he had to destroy the original Rhino if he was going to [[Rapture|ascend]]. Spider-Man defeats the second Rhino who then escapes.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #617\"/>\n\nWhile lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Aleksei. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of J. Jonah Jameson's press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his suit but instead going into hiding with Oksana. However, before they arrive at their safehouse, the second Rhino attacks again and Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei dons his old Rhino suit, totals the new Rhino's suit as his suit was stronger, and kills the unnamed wearer.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #625\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the alternate reality seen in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline, Rhino was one of Death's soldiers on the Moon at Apocalypse's recovery base the Ship. Death captured superhumans and brought them to the Ship and used the Terrigen Mist to turn them into warped powerful monsters for him to control. Rhino was one of the super humans that were captured. He joined Death and other of his henchmen and fought Magneto and the X-Men on the moon. He ends up fighting Rogue but is defeated easily by one punch.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Earth-Charnel===\nRhino was seen as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who travelled through time to stop Charnel, an entity that had been ravaging his future-Earth for decades.

Whilst visiting the hospital with his sick aunt, Rhino briefly loses his temper as he is told to fill in his forms in order for his aunt to receive her meds, before calming down. Waiting in line, he once again comes face to face with Peter Parker, who is with his own family. Remembering that he once threatened Peter under the orders of Harry Osborn, Rhino assures Peter what he did was simply business, and the two call a truce. They spend the remainder of Peter's visit exchanging stories of their lifestyle choices, and part with a better understanding of each other.<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man'' #1.

Rhino is defeated with pepper and Spider-Man baking some mud with a heating device. In the episode \"The Golden Rhino\", Rhino steals a shipment of gold in order to make a gold statue of himself, which he succeeds in after stealing more gold, but is captured by Spider-Man's new webbing: instant steel. He later 'returned' in a third-season budget-saving 'mishmash' episode called \"Rhino\" which uses footage from his other episodes and where he also attempts to make another gold statue of himself, but is again webbed up.\n\n[[File:The Rhino (Spider-Man, TAS).jpeg|thumb|right|Rhino as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]\n* Rhino appears several times in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Don Stark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} While his origin is not detailed in the series, he still retains his abilities from the comics. Here, he is shown as very unintelligent. First appearing in the episode \"The Alien Costume\" Pt. 1, he is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to steal a mineral from [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s space shuttle after crash landing to Earth. Kingpin later sent Rhino to obtain another item where he fights Spider-Man in the black suit. Spider-Man fights the suit's urges to finish off Rhino. In the episode \"The Alien Costume\" Pt. 3, Spider-Man encounters Rhino on the rooftops and fights him where Rhino commented how he missed the black suit previously wore in their last encounter. Rhino was assisted in battle by [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] managing to bury Spider-Man in rubble. By the time Spider-Man emerges from the rubble, the web-slinger finds that Rhino and Shocker have been webbed up by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the episodes \"The Insidious Six\" and \"Battle of the Insidious Six\", Rhino later becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] after he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Mysterio]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and Shocker are sprung from prison by Kingpin. As in one episode, Spider-Man easily fools him into thinking that he is Chameleon and tricks him into attacking the other Insidious Six members (because of this Rhino unintentionally damages Shocker's electrical suit). In the \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" episodes, Rhino was brought back together with the Insidious Six with Vulture acting as Mysterio's replacement. When looking for the keys for Red Skull's doomsday device, Rhino attacks Robert Frank and later, when it appears the villains are victorious, boasts he will soon be \"the new Duke of Jersey\" (in response to which Spider-Man mocks Rhino's lack of ambition). After Kingpin was badly hurt by Electro (Red Skull's son Rheinholdt Kragov), Rhino left with Doctor Octopus, Scorpion, Shocker and Vulture as they are not going to get paid for their services and went back to their own lives.\n\n[[File:Rhino-2-.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rhino in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]].'']]\n* Rhino appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Rhino Voice \u2013 Spider-Man franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Rhino/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | accessdate=December 24, 2019| postscript=.

The two friends had repeated run-ins with Spider-Man while growing frustrated at constantly being dupes and [[punching bag]]s. Concerned about Spider-Man's constant interference in his business, the Big Man had O'Hirn used as one of the guinea pigs in [[Norman Osborn]]'s illegal experiments, in which O'Hirn's body was infused with Dr. Otto Octavius's highly durable titanium resin armor modeled after a [[rhinoceros]]. Although he proves to be one of Spider-man's most physically powerful foes, the costume has a major weakness in that it obstructs his [[Sebaceous gland|pores]]. Now only able to perspire through his face, Rhino must periodically stop fighting and drink water, lest he overheat, a weakness Spider-Man utilizes to defeat him.{{episode needed|date=May 2014}} The costume also inhibits his ability to manipulate small objects such as [[elevator]] buttons.{{episode needed|date=May 2014}} The character appears as the Rhino in the episodes \"The Invisible Hand,\" \"Group Therapy\" \"Reinforcement,\" \"Accomplices\" and \"Opening Night.\"\n* Rhino appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, initially voiced by [[Max Mittelman]] and by [[Daryl Sabara]] as both Alex O'Hirn and Rhino later on.<ref name=\"btva\"/> In contrast to previous iterations, this version of Alex O'Hirn is a teenager. Introduced in his self-titled episode \"The Rhino\", he is shown bullied by [[Flash Thompson]] and has been drinking a vial of rhinoceros serum that he stole from [[Oscorp]] to transform into a humanoid rhinoceros. Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] encounter Rhino at the burning Oscorp building and end up rammed into a tree by Rhino, making off with some exotic animal-related chemicals. Spider-Man and Power Man later stakeout another Oscorp building and find Rhino charging towards an Oscorp train. Spider-Man and Power Man fight Rhino with the resulting fight causing Rhino to gash Power Man's leg. As Rhino charges towards Spider-Man, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrives causing Rhino to retreat with his 'medicines'. The next day, Peter Parker discovers that Rhino is Alex after seeing him with the chemicals that transforms him into Rhino. Spider-Man fights Rhino to keep him from attacking Flash while trying to reason with him to no avail. At Flash's house near a gas station, Spider-Man tries to protect as Rhino charges at Flash, informing Flash that Rhino is actually Alex. Eventually, Rhino was able to regress back to normal due to Spider-Man and Power Man's efforts. As Alex is arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D., Flash apologizes to Alex for the mistreatment. In \"The Sinister Six\", Rhino appears as a member of Doctor Octopus's Sinister Six along with a mind-controlled [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]. He joins in exchange for the promise of more the Rhino formula. In \"Return of the Sinister Six\", Rhino is sprung out of Ryker's Island and is equipped with a tank-like armor. With the Sinister Six armored and reassembled with Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven, Lizard and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], Rhino once again fights Spider-Man and then Power Man. He also assists in the Sinister Six's assault on Iron Patriot. During the chaos, Rhino ends up defeated as Spider-Man defeats the other Sinister Six members. In \"Rampaging Rhino\", Dr. Connors reveals that Rhino is unable to become Alex again after running an analysis. Rhino continues his old rivalry with Agent Venom when Rhino escapes from the [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]]. With help from the [[Hulk]] and the Iron Spider Hulkbuster armor, Spider-Man temporary subdues Rhino in a tunnel after a long destructive fight across the city. Upon making it to Queens, Rhino is unable to have the courage to go into his house and turns himself over to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. With Hulk's help, Spider-Man persuades [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to let Rhino be a student at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy albeit only if Spider-Man responsible for Rhino's actions. Rhino continues to make appearances in further episodes (such as \"Ant-Man\", \"Attack of the Synthezoids\", \"The Revenge of Arnim Zola\" [Parts 1 & 2] and \"Contest of Champions\" [Part 4]). In \"Lizards\", Rhino is revealed to be a spy for Doctor Octopus and the one that injected Dr. Connors with the Lizard, to serve as a distraction while he kidnapped Agent Venom and escaped with him and Doctor Octopus. In the episode \"Double Agent Venom\", it is revealed that Rhino works with Doctor Octopus so that he can be restored to his human form. When Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider arrive to free Flash after he got separated from the Venom symbiote, Rhino buys them time to escape. After Spider-Man's group escapes, Doctor Octopus plans to 'cure' Rhino of his loyalty problem. In \"The New Sinister 6\" Part 1, Rhino appears as a now brainwashed member of the [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]-backed Sinister Six alongside Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven, the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin|Green Goblin]] of the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], and [[Hydro-Man]]. During an assault on the Triskelion, Rhino regains a bit of his consciousness despite being made obedient to Doctor Octopus as he warns Spider-Man that [[Ben Reilly|someone else]] is the real spy. He is then subdued by [[Squirrel Girl]]'s squirrels and taken away, until a cure for Doctor Octopus' brainwashing can be found. In the two-part episode \"Graduation Day\", Rhino fights the Web Warriors at the boathouse until he is subdued when Spider-Man knocked him into the water where Doctor Octopus was hiding. After busting out of his cell, Rhino joins Doctor Octopus' Superior Sinister Six. In the battle at Oscorp, Spider-Man used Doctor Octopus' antidote darts to regress Rhino back to Alex O'Hirn. He and Adrian Toomes then help to defeat Kraven the Hunter. In the end, Alex rejoins S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.\n* Rhino appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]].<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>https://twitter.com/KevinShinick/status/904006052328333312</ref> First appearing in the episode \"A Day in the Life,\" Aleksei Sytsevich is a student at Horizon High from Russia where he gets pricked by a serum-laced needle hidden under Raymond Warren's ring.

In the main version of the game, the player briefly engages Rhino in a \"boss fight\" after he steals a powerful chemical weapon and terrorizes the people on the streets of Manhattan. Serving as the game's first boss, Rhino is easily defeated by Spider-Man and left for the police, whearas the weapon is destroyed during their battle. \n**In the PC version of the game, Rhino is also the first boss, who is fought after escaping from a maximum security prison. The police trap Rhino in an energy cage, which serves as the arena for the fight between him and Spider-Man. Rhino is easily defeated by tricking him to ram into the cage's walls, which electrocute him, but he escapes from the cage, only to ram into a gas station. The explosion knocks Rhino unconscious, but he is rescued from the police by [[Doctor Octopus]], whom he then begins working for. Later, during Doctor Octopus's heist at [[Oscorp]], he dispatches Rhino to fight Spider-Man inside a room with six generators, while he escapes. Rhino is defeated in a manner similar to the first fight, by tricking him to ram into the generators, but this doesn't stop him and he fights Spider-Man again immediately afterwards, in a room with four tubes of [[liquid nitrogen]].

O'Hirn speaks mostly in Latin, appears to be very intelligent, and works for [[Bolivar Trask]], as his company made the R.H.I.N.O. armor; strangely, this makes this version of R.H.I.N.O. the exact opposite of the original version.

Rhino proves to be a very useful ally, as Spider-Man needs to get through a large door in order to get to the Tinkerer, which is powered by several generators that only Rhino can destroy; however, Rhino is still very dangerous and will sometimes launch indiscriminate attacks that can hurt both the enemies and Spider-Man. After making their way past the security system and finding the Tinkerer, Spider-Man and Rhino arrive at a lift leading out of Ryker's Island, where the player is given two choices: trick Rhino into returning to his cell, or activate the lift and allow Rhino to escape, so that he could also help deal with the symbiote inavsion.

Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Rhino serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for super-villains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Rhino, Electro, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Rhino wishes to have his armor removed. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Rhino attacks the hero while he is fighting escaped inmates, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of his secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino being sent to destroy the medical aid stations set up by [[Oscorp]] for the people infected with the Devil's Breath virus. After Spider-Man stops Scorpion from succeeding with his task - to poison the city's water reservoir - he joins forces with Rhino to help him with his task, and the two are later seen at the docks, fighting some [[Silver Sable|Sable]] International mercenaries who are guarding the stations. [[Miles Morales]] accidentally encounters Scorpion and Rhino while he is at the docks, trying to get some antibiotics, but he manages to escape from them and then calls Peter Parker to tell him about what has happened. The police later tracks down Scorpion and Rhino at the docks and Spider-Man arrives to defeat the two villains and foil their attack. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them, turning them against each other and trapping them inside a shipping container, just as the police arrives to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man states that Aleksei hates being called \"Rhino\", and that he needed a couple of weeks to recover after their very first battle, with Rhino destroying several city blocks in the process.\n\n===Novels===\n* Rhino appears in [[Jim Butcher]]'s Spider-Man novel ''[[Spider-Man: The Darkest Hours|The Darkest Hours]]'', in which he and Spider-Man are forced to ally against the family of [[Morlun]], and the two old foes gain a deeper respect for one another. Indeed, listening to Aleksei's life story, Peter finds out that the two of them are not all that different and have had many of the same problems in life. Also, Rhino points out that he hates his costume, but must wear it because it's what his clients expect.\n\n===Theatre===\n* Rhino will appear as one of the villains in the ''[[Marvel Universe Live!]]'' stage show.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/21561/character_reveals_for_marvel_universe_live \"Character Reveals for Marvel Universe LIVE!\"] Marvel Comics.

When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, \"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now.

As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, \"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\"/> He has also contributed performances on the [[ukulele]], harmonica, [[accordion]], and [[electric sitar]] to various Pearl Jam recordings.\n\n[['Weird Al' Yankovic]] wrote the song \"My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder\" for his album [[Running with Scissors (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic album)|''Running with Scissors'']].

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality.

When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, \"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now.

As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, \"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\"/> He has also contributed performances on the [[ukulele]], harmonica, [[accordion]], and [[electric sitar]] to various Pearl Jam recordings.\n\n[['Weird Al' Yankovic]] wrote the song \"My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder\" for his album [[Running with Scissors (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic album)|''Running with Scissors'']].

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"<ref name=\"hiatt\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nVedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam.

These [[episode]]s should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a [[miniseries]], a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on [[television]], shown in [[movie theatre]]s, released [[direct-to-video]] or on the [[internet]]. Like animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of [[List of genres|genres]] and can also have different [[target audience]]s, from [[children]] to [[adult animation|adults]].\n\n==Television==\n{{see also|List of animated television series}}\nAnimated [[television program|television series]] are regularly presented and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed [[time slot]]. The time slot may vary including morning, like [[saturday-morning cartoon]]s, prime time, like [[prime time cartoon]]s, to late night, like [[late night anime]]. They may also be broadcast on weekdays ([[weekday cartoon]]s) or only on weekends.\n\nThe duration of each episode varies depending on the series. Traditionally, series are produced as complete half-hour or nearly half-hour programs; however, many are produced as animated [[Short film|shorts]] of 10\u201311 minutes, which can then paired with other shorts to fill a set time period. If on television 15-20 minutes based on commercial time. A full half hour would cut into advertisement time frames. note that Netflix and other streaming companies that don't show commercials may require a full 30 minute cartoon the length depends on the company that airs the cartoon. There are also some short series with a length of approximately five minutes; these have recently become more common in [[anime]].\n\nThey are sometimes grouped together according to [[television network|network]] programming demands. Thus a particular series may appear in a number of formats or time blocks.\n\nAnimated television series had historically been used for [[comedy]], like the [[cartoon]]s, a piece of art, usually developed for humorous intent, and so, called cartoon series. However, more recently animated television series have fallen into other genres, such as [[Action (fiction)|action]] / [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] series like ''[[Speed Racer]]'' and ''[[G.I. Joe]]''.\n\nThe first animated television series was ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.\n\n[[Animated sitcom]]s first appeared in the 1960s, with ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966), followed by ''[[The Jetsons]]'' (1962\u20131987).\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'', an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of ''[[All in the Family]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s was a renaissance of the cartoon [[children's television series]] and [[adult animation|adult's television series]]. Various [[broadcast network]]s and media companies began creating television channels and formats designed specifically for airing cartoon series. Companies that already had these types of formats in place began to revamp their existing models during this time. Examples of these are:\n\n{{columns-list|\n* [[Tooniverse]]<!--This channel is Korean-->\n* [[Cartoon Network]]\n* [[Fox Kids]]\n* [[Kids' WB]]\n* [[UPN Kids]]\n* [[Discovery Family]]\n* [[Nickelodeon]]\n* [[Nick Jr.]]\n* [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]]\n* [[Disney Channel]]\n* [[Disney XD]]\n* [[Disney Junior]]\n* [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]\n* [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]]\n* [[Adult Swim]]\n* [[Qubo]]\n* [[Universal Kids]]\n* [[CBeebies]]\n* [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]]\n* [[PBS Kids]]\n* [[4Kids TV]]\n* [[Pop]]{{dn}}\n* [[Tiny Pop]]\n}}\nDuring the 1990s more mature content than those of traditional cartoon series began to appear more widely, extending beyond a primary audience of children. These cartoon series included ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'',  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''.

These [[episode]]s should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a [[miniseries]], a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on [[television]], shown in [[movie theatre]]s, released [[direct-to-video]] or on the [[internet]]. Like animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of [[List of genres|genres]] and can also have different [[target audience]]s, from [[children]] to [[adult animation|adults]].\n\n==Television==\n{{see also|List of animated television series}}\nAnimated [[television program|television series]] are regularly presented and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed [[time slot]]. The time slot may vary including morning, like [[saturday-morning cartoon]]s, prime time, like [[prime time cartoon]]s, to late night, like [[late night anime]]. They may also be broadcast on weekdays ([[weekday cartoon]]s) or only on weekends.\n\nThe duration of each episode varies depending on the series. Traditionally, series are produced as complete half-hour or nearly half-hour programs; however, many are produced as animated [[Short film|shorts]] of 10\u201311 minutes, which can then paired with other shorts to fill a set time period. If on television 15-20 minutes based on commercial time. A full half hour would cut into advertisement time frames. note that Netflix and other streaming companies that don't show commercials may require a full 30 minute cartoon the length depends on the company that airs the cartoon. There are also some short series with a length of approximately five minutes; these have recently become more common in [[anime]].\n\nThey are sometimes grouped together according to [[television network|network]] programming demands. Thus a particular series may appear in a number of formats or time blocks.\n\nAnimated television series had historically been used for [[comedy]], like the [[cartoon]]s, a piece of art, usually developed for humorous intent, and so, called cartoon series. However, more recently animated television series have fallen into other genres, such as [[Action (fiction)|action]] / [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] series like ''[[Speed Racer]]'' and ''[[G.I. Joe]]''.\n\nThe first animated television series was ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.\n\n[[Animated sitcom]]s first appeared in the 1960s, with ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966), followed by ''[[The Jetsons]]'' (1962\u20131987).\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'', an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of ''[[All in the Family]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s was a renaissance of the cartoon [[children's television series]] and [[adult animation|adult's television series]]. Various [[broadcast network]]s and media companies began creating television channels and formats designed specifically for airing cartoon series. Companies that already had these types of formats in place began to revamp their existing models during this time. Examples of these are:\n\n{{columns-list|\n* [[Tooniverse]]<!--This channel is Korean-->\n* [[Cartoon Network]]\n* [[Fox Kids]]\n* [[Kids' WB]]\n* [[UPN Kids]]\n* [[Discovery Family]]\n* [[Nickelodeon]]\n* [[Nick Jr.]]\n* [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]]\n* [[Disney Channel]]\n* [[Disney XD]]\n* [[Disney Junior]]\n* [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]\n* [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]]\n* [[Adult Swim]]\n* [[Qubo]]\n* [[Universal Kids]]\n* [[CBeebies]]\n* [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]]\n* [[PBS Kids]]\n* [[4Kids TV]]\n* [[Pop]]\n* [[Tiny Pop]]\n}}\nDuring the 1990s more mature content than those of traditional cartoon series began to appear more widely, extending beyond a primary audience of children. These cartoon series included ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'',  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''.

Although [[George Washington]] and his commanders expected the battle to continue the following day, the British forces retreated during the night and continued on to [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey|Sandy Hook]], [[New Jersey]].\n\nAfter the battle, General Washington asked about the woman whom he had seen loading a cannon on the battlefield.

McCauley was a stone cutter for the local Carlisle prison. However, the marriage was reportedly not a happy one, as McCauley had a violent temper.

Sometime between 1807 and 1810, McCauley disappeared, and it is not known what happened to him.\n\nMary McCauley continued to live in Carlisle.

Mary died January 22, 1832, in Carlisle, at the approximate age of 87.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9060208 \"Pitcher, Molly.\"] ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. 13 February 2007.</ref> She is buried in the Old Graveyard in Carlisle under the name \"Molly McCauley\".
