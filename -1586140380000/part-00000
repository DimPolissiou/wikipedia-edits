McIntyre regularly defended the title until 11 June, when Tyler Reks (the former Gabe Tuft) won the title in his second attempt.<ref name=\"fcwh\"/> Later that month, McIntyre failed to win a 14-man battle royal for a chance to regain the title. On 25 June, McIntyre was set to team with O'Shaunessy against the returning Hennig and DJ Gabriel (the aforementioned \"Sterling Jack\" Gabriel), but when neither team would work together a four-way was booked, which O'Shaunessy won. McIntyre and O'Shaunessy both failed to win back the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship in mid-July from Reks. McIntyre received a singles opportunity the next day with the same result.<ref name=\"fcw09\"/>\n\n==== The Chosen One (2009\u20132010) ====\n[[File:Drew mcintyre.jpg|thumb|left|McIntyre in a match against [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]]]\nOn 28 August 2009, McIntyre re-debuted on the SmackDown brand, disregarding his previous time on WWE television, and established himself as a villain by attacking [[R-Truth]] as he entered the ring, using his new [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Double underhook DDT|double underhook DDT]] finishing move, the ''Scot Drop'' (soon renamed the ''Future Shock'').<ref name=\"sd2808\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/font_color_770000_KELLER_S_TAKE_font_11/article_34872.shtml|title=WWE SmackDown Report 8/28: Results, star ratings, thoughts, observations, nitpicks, quotebook|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=29 August 2009|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref> McIntyre continued to attack Truth over the following weeks, claiming to be on the show to wrestle not to party like R-Truth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1253405895.php|publisher=Wrestle View|title=Smackdown Results \u2013 9/18/09|date=19 September 2009|accessdate=23 October 2009|first=Mike|last=Tedesco}}</ref> On 18 September, while Charlie Haas was waiting to face R-Truth, McIntyre came to the ring to explain that R-Truth had been injured backstage, and then attacked Haas.<ref name=\"sd189\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09182009/mainarticle|title=Consumed in controversy|last=Burdick|first=Michael|date=18 September 2009|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref> On 25 September, WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon#Professional wrestling|Mr. McMahon]] introduced McIntyre as a \"future world champion\" that he had personally signed, after which Truth made a return attack against McIntyre.<ref name=\"sd269\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/09/26/11135656.html|title=Smackdown: Punk escapes 'Taker's grasp|last=Sidhu|first=Manraj|date=26 September 2009|work=Slam!

Rukia is one of the [[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach|Soul Reapers]], soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the {{nihongo4|Soul Society|\u5c38\u9b42\u754c {{small|(\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30fb\u30bd\u30b5\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3)}}||lit. \"Dead Spirit World\"}}\u2014the afterlife realm from which she originates\u2014and with fighting [[List of Hollows in Bleach|Hollows]], monstrous lost souls who can harm both ghosts and humans. When she is severely wounded defending Ichigo from a Hollow she is pursuing, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo so that he may fight in her stead while she recovers her strength. Rukia is thereby trapped in an ordinary human body, and must advise Ichigo as he balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and attending high school. For aid in hunting the Hollows, the pair ally with a trio of other spiritually empowered teenagers: Ichigo's high school classmate [[Orihime Inoue]], best friend [[Yasutora Sado|Yasutora \"Chad\" Sado]] and the Quincy\u2014humans who can fight Hollows\u2014[[Ury\u016b Ishida]].\n\nEventually, Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death for the illegal act of transferring her powers into a human. Ichigo and friends enlist the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist [[Kisuke Urahara]], who also enables Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers, to enter Soul Society and rescue Rukia. Shortly after the party's arrival in the Soul Society, conflict arises among the captains of the 13 Court Squads when the captain of the fifth company, [[S\u014dsuke Aizen]], is apparently murdered, which causes the Soul Reapers to begin fighting amongst themselves. However, as Ichigo is almost successful in rescuing Rukia, and Soul Society is on the verge of civil war, Aizen reappears and reveals his intention to obtain the {{nihongo4|H\u014dgyoku|\u5d29\u7389||lit. \"Crumbling Orb\"}}\u2014an orb of immense power\u2014that Kisuke planted in Rukia's human vessel by faking his death and arranging Rukia's execution. Aizen is accompanied by his fellow conspirators, [[Gin Ichimaru]] and Kaname T\u014dsen who are the third and ninth company's captains, as they use Hollows to cover their escape into the Hollows' realm, {{nihongo4|Hueco Mundo|\u865a\u570f {{small|(\u30a6\u30a7\u30b3\u30e0\u30f3\u30c9)}}||lit. \"Hollow World\"}}. Afterwards, Ichigo and Rukia reconcile with the Soul Reapers, who view the former as a powerful ally and designate him as an official substitute Soul Reaper.\n\nIchigo soon finds himself and his friends in escalating skirmishes with Aizen's army of humanoid Hollows, the [[List of Hollows in Bleach#Arrancar|Arrancar]], as they are joined by the [[List of Bleach characters#Vizards|Vizards]]\u2014Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen's experiments in creating Soul Reaper/Hollow hybrids. When one of the Espada\u2014Aizen's 10 most powerful Arrancars\u2014kidnaps Orihime, Ichigo and his allies enter Hueco Mundo to invade Aizen's palace. However, as Ichigo rescues Orihime, Aizen reveals her abduction was a distraction as he launches an attack on Karakura Town in order to sacrifice the souls of the living and create a key to the Soul King's Palace so he can kill the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. When the Vizards join the remaining Soul Reapers to face their mutual enemy, Gin reveals his own agenda of assassinating Aizen. However, the latter then uses the H\u014dgyoku to become a Hollow-like being and overpower everyone. Ichigo ultimately succeeds in subduing Aizen at the cost of his powers and reverts to a normal human.\n\nMonths later, preparing for life after high school, Ichigo is called back into action when [[List of Bleach characters#Xcution|Xcution]], a gang of Fullbringers\u2014supernaturally aware humans like Chad\u2014manipulate him and his loved ones in a scheme to siphon his Fullbring abilities. After his Soul Society allies restore his Soul Reaper powers, learning that Xcution's leader Ginjo Kujo was his predecessor, and that the substitute Soul Reapers are not fully trusted, Ichigo defeats Ginjo while resolving to continue fighting with the Soul Society.\n\nAfter Ichigo regained his powers, an army of Quincies known as the {{nihongo4|[[List of Bleach characters#Wandenreich|Wandenreich]]|\u898b\u3048\u3056\u308b\u5e1d\u56fd {{small|(\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30d2)}}||lit. \"Invisible Empire\"}} appear and declare their own war on the Soul Society, after enslaving the Arrancars. The group is led by Yhwach, the ancient progenitor of the Quincies who seeks to kill the Soul King and rid the world of the fear of death. In their first invasion, the Wandenreich kill many Soul Reapers including the head-captain. Ury\u016b joins the Wandenreich as a means to get close to Yhwach, who was responsible for the death of his mother among other Quincies. Later on, Ichigo and his friends aid the Soul Society in fighting the Wandenreich's second invasion, but Yhwach proceeds to slay the Soul King. In the final battle, Yhwach returns to the Soul Society to conquer it, but with the help of Ury\u016b's father, Ichigo and Ury\u016b defeat the Quincy leader.\n\nYears later, Rukia becomes the new captain of the thirteenth company and has a daughter, an apprentice Soul Reaper named Ichika, with her childhood friend [[Renji Abarai]]. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who is also training to become a Soul Reaper.\n\n==Production==\n''Bleach'' was first conceived from [[Tite Kubo]]'s desire to draw a [[Shinigami]] (Soul Reaper) in a [[kimono]], which formed the basis for the design of the Soul Reapers in the series.<ref name=\"About 1\">{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistinterviews/a/TiteKubo.htm|title=Interview: Tite Kubo (page 1)|author=Deb Aoki|publisher=About.com|accessdate=September 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28|title=Creator Tite Kubo surprised by 'Bleach' success|author=Charles Solomon|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|archivedate=April 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423115417/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28}}</ref> At first, Kubo thought that the Soul Reapers should use guns, so the first title for the series was \"Snipe\" (as in \"sniper\"); however, this was changed with the inclusion of swords.<ref name=\"SJ 71\">{{cite journal | journal=Shonen Jump #71 | publisher=Viz Media | volume=6 | issue=11 | date=November 2008 | title=Tite Kubo's Big Comic-Con Adventure! | pages=18\u201320}}</ref> After that, the series was meant to be named \"Black\" due to the color of the Soul Reapers' clothes, but Kubo thought the title was too generic.

Many of the names for swords and spells used by Soul Reapers were inspired by ancient [[Japanese literature]]. Hollows and Arrancars use [[Spanish language|Spanish]] terms. Fullbringers use [[English language|English]] vocabulary, with names referencing rock music, and finally, both Quincy and Bounts draw on the [[German language]].

A Japanese [[Bleach (2018 film)|live-action film adaptation]] produced by [[Warner Bros.]] was released in 2018.\n\nEnglish-language releases of ''Bleach'' are coordinated by [[Viz Media]], which has released several volumes of the manga each year since 2004, and published chapters of ''Bleach'' in its ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'' magazine since November 2007. Viz Media secured foreign television and home video distribution rights to the ''Bleach'' anime in 2006. [[Adult Swim]] began airing dubbed episodes of ''Bleach'' in the United States that fall, and [[Hulu]] later began to stream subtitled versions of the anime a week after each episode aired in Japan. Viz Media has also released each of the four ''Bleach'' feature films in English.\n\n''Bleach'' received the [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for the ''sh\u014dnen'' demographic (teenage males) in 2005, and is among the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga]] in both Japan and the United States.

Rukia is one of the [[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach|Soul Reapers]], soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the {{nihongo4|Soul Society|\u5c38\u9b42\u754c {{small|(\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30fb\u30bd\u30b5\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3)}}||lit. \"Dead Spirit World\"}}\u2014the afterlife realm from which she originates\u2014and with fighting [[List of Hollows in Bleach|Hollows]], monstrous lost souls who can harm both ghosts and humans. When she is severely wounded defending Ichigo from a Hollow she is pursuing, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo so that he may fight in her stead while she recovers her strength. Rukia is thereby trapped in an ordinary human body, and must advise Ichigo as he balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and attending high school. For aid in hunting the Hollows, the pair ally with a trio of other spiritually empowered teenagers: Ichigo's high school classmate [[Orihime Inoue]], best friend [[Yasutora Sado|Yasutora \"Chad\" Sado]] and the Quincy\u2014humans who can fight Hollows\u2014[[Ury\u016b Ishida]].\n\nEventually, Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death for the illegal act of transferring her powers into a human. Ichigo and friends enlist the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist [[Kisuke Urahara]], who also enables Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers, to enter Soul Society and rescue Rukia. Shortly after the party's arrival in the Soul Society, conflict arises among the captains of the 13 Court Squads when the captain of the fifth company, [[S\u014dsuke Aizen]], is apparently murdered, which causes the Soul Reapers to begin fighting amongst themselves. However, as Ichigo is almost successful in rescuing Rukia, and Soul Society is on the verge of civil war, Aizen reappears and reveals his intention to obtain the {{nihongo4|H\u014dgyoku|\u5d29\u7389||lit. \"Crumbling Orb\"}}\u2014an orb of immense power\u2014that Kisuke planted in Rukia's human vessel by faking his death and arranging Rukia's execution. Aizen is accompanied by his fellow conspirators, [[Gin Ichimaru]] and Kaname T\u014dsen who are the third and ninth company's captains, as they use Hollows to cover their escape into the Hollows' realm, {{nihongo4|Hueco Mundo|\u865a\u570f {{small|(\u30a6\u30a7\u30b3\u30e0\u30f3\u30c9)}}||lit. \"Hollow World\"}}. Afterwards, Ichigo and Rukia reconcile with the Soul Reapers, who view the former as a powerful ally and designate him as an official substitute Soul Reaper.\n\nIchigo soon finds himself and his friends in escalating skirmishes with Aizen's army of humanoid Hollows, the [[List of Hollows in Bleach#Arrancar|Arrancar]], as they are joined by the [[List of Bleach characters#Vizards|Vizards]]\u2014Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen's experiments in creating Soul Reaper/Hollow hybrids. When one of the Espada\u2014Aizen's 10 most powerful Arrancars\u2014kidnaps Orihime, Ichigo and his allies enter Hueco Mundo to invade Aizen's palace. However, as Ichigo rescues Orihime, Aizen reveals her abduction was a distraction as he launches an attack on Karakura Town in order to sacrifice the souls of the living and create a key to the Soul King's Palace so he can kill the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. When the Vizards join the remaining Soul Reapers to face their mutual enemy, Gin reveals his own agenda of assassinating Aizen. However, the latter then uses the H\u014dgyoku to become a Hollow-like being and overpower everyone. Ichigo ultimately succeeds in subduing Aizen at the cost of his powers and reverts to a normal human.\n\nMonths later, preparing for life after high school, Ichigo is called back into action when [[List of Bleach characters#Xcution|Xcution]], a gang of Fullbringers\u2014supernaturally aware humans like Chad\u2014manipulate him and his loved ones in a scheme to siphon his Fullbring abilities. After his Soul Society allies restore his Soul Reaper powers, learning that Xcution's leader Ginjo Kujo was his predecessor, and that the substitute Soul Reapers are not fully trusted, Ichigo defeats Ginjo while resolving to continue fighting with the Soul Society.\n\nAfter Ichigo regained his powers, an army of Quincies known as the {{nihongo4|[[List of Bleach characters#Wandenreich|Wandenreich]]|\u898b\u3048\u3056\u308b\u5e1d\u56fd {{small|(\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30d2)}}||lit. \"Invisible Empire\"}} appear and declare their own war on the Soul Society, after enslaving the Arrancars. The group is led by Yhwach, the ancient progenitor of the Quincies who seeks to kill the Soul King and rid the world of the fear of death. In their first invasion, the Wandenreich kill many Soul Reapers including the head-captain. Ury\u016b joins the Wandenreich as a means to get close to Yhwach, who was responsible for the death of his mother among other Quincies. Later on, Ichigo and his friends aid the Soul Society in fighting the Wandenreich's second invasion, but Yhwach proceeds to slay the Soul King. In the final battle, Yhwach returns to the Soul Society to conquer it, but with the help of Ury\u016b's father, Ichigo and Ury\u016b defeat the Quincy leader.\n\nYears later, Rukia becomes the new captain of the thirteenth company and has a daughter, an apprentice Soul Reaper named Ichika, with her childhood friend [[Renji Abarai]]. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who is also training to become a Soul Reaper.\n\n==Production==\n''Bleach'' was first conceived from [[Tite Kubo]]'s desire to draw a [[Shinigami]] (Soul Reaper) in a [[kimono]], which formed the basis for the design of the Soul Reapers in the series.<ref name=\"About 1\">{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistinterviews/a/TiteKubo.htm|title=Interview: Tite Kubo (page 1)|author=Deb Aoki|publisher=About.com|accessdate=September 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28|title=Creator Tite Kubo surprised by 'Bleach' success|author=Charles Solomon|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|archivedate=April 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423115417/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28}}</ref> At first, Kubo thought that the Soul Reapers should use guns, so the first title for the series was \"Snipe\" (as in \"sniper\"); however, this was changed with the inclusion of swords.<ref name=\"SJ 71\">{{cite journal | journal=Shonen Jump #71 | publisher=Viz Media | volume=6 | issue=11 | date=November 2008 | title=Tite Kubo's Big Comic-Con Adventure! | pages=18\u201320}}</ref> After that, the series was meant to be named \"Black\" due to the color of the Soul Reapers' clothes, but Kubo thought the title was too generic.

North of I-295, US 1 enters a commercial area with multiple furniture stores, with an intersection with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]]. A 1/2 mile northwest is an interchange with I-95.\n\nA few miles north, US 1 intersects Sunbeam Road (County Road 116), which connects to [[Florida State Road 13|State Road 13]]. It then heads to [[Florida State Road 152|State Road 152]], locally known as Baymeadows Road. As US 1 heads towards the heart of Jacksonville, it intersects with [[Florida State Road 202|State Road 202]], locally known as JTB Boulevard, a freeway through eastern Jacksonville. US 1 then heads towards Bowden Road, providing access to southbound I-95, followed one block later by [[Florida State Road 109|State Road 109]], locally known as University Boulevard. A few miles north, it intersects Emerson Street, signed as [[U.S. Highway 1 Alternate (Jacksonville, Florida)|U.S. Highway 1 Alternate]] to the east and  [[Florida State Road 126|State Road 126]] to the west. It then intersects St. Augustine Road and Philips Highway ends at I-95 exit 348.\n\n[[File:Main Street Bridge Jacksonville southbound approach.jpg|thumb|left|[[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]] from [[Downtown Jacksonville]] ]]\nNorth of Philips Highway, US 1 continues as Kings Avenue, running within a block of I-95. One block north of I-95, it intersects [[U.S. Route 90 (Florida)|U.S. Route 90]], and starts a concurrency as the two highways head north. After crossing under I-95, the road intersects [[Florida State Road 13|State Road 13]] twice, heading towards the [[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]], crossing the [[St. Johns River]]. North of the bridge, the road becomes a [[one-way pair]], named Ocean Street northbound and Main Street southbound. It then intersects [[Florida State Road 228|State Road 228]], starting a concurrency. Several blocks north, it ends the US 90 concurrency and begins a concurrency with US 90 Alternate. It then intersects with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]], and the national southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 23 (Florida)|U.S. Route 23]]. It also ends the concurrencies of US 90 Alternate and SR&nbsp;228. It also starts a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 17 (Florida)|U.S. Route 17]]. At that point, the one-way pair ends, and US 1 leaves downtown as Main Street. It then intersects US 1 Alternate, and the road heads west on the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (Jacksonville)|Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway]], ending the concurrency with US 17, which heads north. At this point, US 1 changes its unsigned state road from SR&nbsp;5 to [[Florida State Road 15|State Road 15]].\n\nU.S. 1 then intersects I-95 one last time on a cloverleaf interchange on exit 354A; the two highways will not meet again until Virginia. U.S. 1 continues west, with the parkway ending with an intersection of [[U.S. Route 23 (Florida)|U.S. Route 23]], which US 1 shares a concurrency with from here to the Georgia state line. The road continues northwest, intersecting [[Florida State Road 111|State Road 111]], and crossing the [[Ribault River]] just north of that intersection. US 1 then intersects [[Florida State Road 115A|State Road 115A]]. Just south of the I-295 West Beltway, it passes west of the Little Trout River. It then has an interchange with the I-295 West Beltway, followed by an intersection with Trout River Boulevard. US 1 then crosses the [[Trout River (Florida)|Trout River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[St. Johns River]], and intersects [[Florida State Road 104|State Road 104]] immediately north of the river. The road then heads towards the Thomas Creek Conversation Area, leaving Duval County at the Thomas Creek Bridge.\n\n===Nassau County===\nNorth of the Thomas Creek Conservation Area, it enters Nassau County, and [[Nassau Village-Ratliff, Florida|Nassau Village-Ratliff]]. It next heads to [[Callahan, Florida|Callahan]], where it intersects with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]]. At the center part of town, it intersects the northern terminus of [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]] and [[Florida State Road 200|State Road 200]], as well as starting a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 301 (Florida)|U.S. Route 301]] that continues beyond the Georgia state line. Just north of Callahan, US 1 intersects County Road 115. US 1 heads north towards [[Hilliard, Florida|Hilliard]], which contains an intersection with [[County Road 108 (Nassau County, Florida)|CR 108]]. Heading north towards Georgia, it passes by a [[welcome center]] on the southbound side in [[Boulogne, Florida|Boulogne]], followed by an intersection with [[County Road 121 (Nassau County, Florida)|CR 121]]/Lake Hampton Road, the last intersection before US 1 crosses the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Marys River]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state line.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Historical US&nbsp;1 route markers\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = US 1 Florida 1926.svg\n| alt1      = US 1 route marker\n| caption1  = 1926 design\n| image2    = US 1 Florida 1948.svg\n| alt2      = US 1 route marker\n| caption2  = 1948 design\n| image3= US 1 (FL).svg\n| alt3= US 1 route marker\n| caption3 =1956-1993, red highway shields\n| image4    = US 1.svg\n| alt4      = US 1 route marker\n| caption4  = Modern design\n}}\nUS 1 was designated nationwide on November 11, 1926, running from [[Miami, Florida]], north to [[Fort Kent, Maine]].<ref>{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth298433/m1/1/zoom/ |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[University of North Texas Libraries]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref> The label was generally applied to the [[Atlantic Highway (United States)|Atlantic Highway]], except between [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and [[Augusta, Georgia]], where a more inland route was chosen. In Florida, US 1 was designated along the full length of [[Florida State Road 4 (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4]]. South of Jacksonville, this was both the Atlantic Highway and the eastern division of the [[Dixie Highway]]; the route from Jacksonville northwest into Georgia was a Jacksonville\u2013[[Macon, Georgia]] Dixie Highway connector.\n\n[[File:Photograph of a road sign along the highway in Key West, Florida, announcing the beginning of U.S. Route 1 to Fort... - NARA - 200542.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of US 1 as of March 1951]]\nWith the [[Overseas Highway]] completed in 1938, US 1 was extended from Miami over the [[Overseas Highway]] (SR&nbsp;4A) to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] shortly afterward, where it still ends today.\n\nThe section of US 1 between Miami and Jacksonville has been replaced by [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] for most through traffic.\n\nIn Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway, the \"shield\" for US 1 was red. Florida began using the colored shields in 1956, but during the 1980s the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] was revised to specify only a black and white color scheme for [[U.S. Highway shield]]s. As such, Federal funds were no longer available to maintain the colored signs. On August 27, 1993, the decision was made to no longer produce colored signs. Since then, the remaining colored signs have been replaced gradually by black-and-white signs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{for|a complete list of intersections and bridges in the [[Florida Keys]]|Overseas Highway}}{{jcttop|state=FL|length_ref=<ref name=sld>[http://www2.dot.state.fl.us/Straight-linesOnlineGIS/ FDOT straight line diagrams], accessed January 2014</ref>}}\n{{FLint\n|county=Monroe\n|cspan=20\n|location=Key West\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.000\n|road=Fleming Street\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=3.927\n|road={{jct|state=FL|SR|A1A|dir1=south|name1=Roosevelt Boulevard|location1=[[Key West International Airport|Airport]]|extra=airport|location2=Beaches}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Key West segment of SR&nbsp;A1A\n}}\n<!--4.531=0-->\n{{FLint\n|location=Stock Island<!--looks like the Key West city limits are the north ROW line-->\n|mile=4.586\n|road=MacDonald Drive\n|notes=Former [[Florida State Road 4A (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4A]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Boca Chica Key\n|mile=8.08\n|road=[[Naval Air Station Key West]]\n|notes=Interchange\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=East Rockland Key\n|mile=9.183\n|road=Rockland Drive&nbsp;\u2013 [[NAS Key West|NAS]] Truck Entrance\n|notes=Former US&nbsp;1 south\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Coppitt Key\n|mile=10.691\n|road=Boca Chica Road ([[County Road 941 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;941]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;941 (former [[Florida State Road 941|SR&nbsp;941]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Lower Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=16.955\n|road=Sugarloaf Boulevard ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former [[Florida State Road 939|SR&nbsp;939]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=19.970\n|road=State Road 939B<!--yes, that's the street name--> ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former SR&nbsp;939)\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Summerland Key\n|mile=25.197\n|road=East Shore Drive ([[County Road 942 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;942]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;942 (former [[Florida State Road 942|SR&nbsp;942]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Pine Key\n|mile=30.527\n|road=Key Deer Boulevard ([[County Road 940 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;940]] north)&nbsp;\u2013 [[National Key Deer Visitor Center]]\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;940 (former [[Florida State Road 940|SR&nbsp;940]])\n}}<!--31.079=0-->\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Bahia Honda Channel]]\n|mile=35.272\n|mile2=36.544\n|bridge=[[Bahia Honda Bridge]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Moser Channel]]\n|mile=40.011\n|mile2=46.804\n|bridge=[[Seven Mile Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Marathon\n|lspan=2\n|mile=48.059\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|931|county1=Monroe|dir1=north|name1=20th Street}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former [[Florida State Road 931|SR&nbsp;931]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=49.965\n|road=Sombrero Beach Road ([[County Road 931 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;931]] south)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sombrero Beach]]\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former SR&nbsp;931)\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Long Key Channel]]\n|mile=63.140\n|mile2=65.446\n|bridge=[[Long Key Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Islamorada\n|lspan=4\n|mile=84.344\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|905|county1=Monroe|dir1=north}}<!--no CR&nbsp;905 shields, but it's the street name-->\n|notes=Former SR&nbsp;4A;

As Biscayne Boulevard, US 1 becomes a one-way pair at an intersection with [[Florida State Road 970|State Road 970]]. Two blocks north, it reaches [[Florida State Road 968|State Road 968]] (Flagler Street), the north\u2013south baseline for most of Miami-Dade County. US 1 then passes by the western end of [[Bayfront Park]], and then intersects Port Boulevard (NE 6th Street), providing access to the [[Port of Miami]], with the [[American Airlines Arena]] at the northeastern end of the intersection. For the next few blocks, it passes by [[Bicentennial Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park]], with [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|Interstate 395]] at the northern end, which also marks the national southern terminus of US 41. US 1 continues through midtown Miami, intersecting with the national southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|U.S. Route 27]] one block south of [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|Interstate 195]] next to the Julia Tuttle Causeway. North of I-195, the road continues through Miami as a residential road, intersecting [[Florida State Road 944|State Road 944]], [[Florida State Road 934|State Road 934]], and [[Florida State Road 915|State Road 915]] before leaving Miami. Moving further inland, the Boulevard replaces East Sixth Avenue at 61st Street. It enters the village of [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]] at North 87th Street. Crossing the Biscayne Canal, Miami Shores becomes [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]]. In North Miami, it intersects [[Florida State Road 922|State Road 922]], leading to the Broad Causeway and [[Florida State Road 916|State Road 916]]. In [[North Miami Beach, Florida|North Miami Beach]], it intersects [[Florida State Road 826|State Road 826]], and [[Florida State Road 860|State Road 860]]. The road enters [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] at [[Greynolds Park]]. It continues north-northeast through the city of Aventura, curving due north at North 187th Street and northeast at North 203rd Street. In Aventura, it intersects [[Florida State Road 856|State Road 856]] at the southwest of the [[Aventura Mall]], and after intersecting the former [[Florida State Road 854|State Road 854]], it leaves Miami-Dade County.\n\n===Broward County===\n[[File:Ft Laud FL New River Tunnel north01.jpg|thumb|New River Tunnel, going north]]\nEntering [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] near [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]], US 1 first intersects [[Florida State Road 858|State Road 858]]. Next it meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 824|State Road 824]], which provides access to [[Miramar, Florida|Miramar]] and [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]]. Entering [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 820|State Road 820]] in a [[traffic circle]] around Anniversary Park. In [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], it meets [[Florida State Road 822|State Road 822]] and [[Florida State Road 848|State Road 848]]. Here [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]] also begins running concurrently with the road just south of [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]] for a few miles. Near the southeastern corner of the airport, US 1 meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 818|State Road 818]]. It then proceeds to run around the eastern edge of the airport. On the northeastern corner, US 1 meets [[Interstate 595 (Florida)|I-595]].

In Florida, US 1 was designated along the full length of [[Florida State Road 4 (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4]]. South of Jacksonville, this was both the Atlantic Highway and the eastern division of the [[Dixie Highway]]; the route from Jacksonville northwest into Georgia was a Jacksonville\u2013[[Macon, Georgia]] Dixie Highway connector.\n\n[[File:Photograph of a road sign along the highway in Key West, Florida, announcing the beginning of U.S. Route 1 to Fort... - NARA - 200542.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of US 1 as of March 1951]]\nWith the [[Overseas Highway]] completed in 1938, US 1 was extended from Miami over the [[Overseas Highway]] (SR&nbsp;4A) to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] shortly afterward, where it still ends today.\n\nThe section of US 1 between Miami and Jacksonville has been replaced by [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] for most through traffic.\n\nIn Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway, the \"shield\" for US 1 was red.

As such, Federal funds were no longer available to maintain the colored signs. On August 27, 1993, the decision was made to no longer produce colored signs. Since then, the remaining colored signs have been replaced gradually by black-and-white signs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{for|a complete list of intersections and bridges in the [[Florida Keys]]|Overseas Highway}}{{jcttop|state=FL|length_ref=<ref name=sld>[http://www2.dot.state.fl.us/Straight-linesOnlineGIS/ FDOT straight line diagrams], accessed January 2014</ref>}}\n{{FLint\n|county=Monroe\n|cspan=20\n|location=Key West\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.000\n|road=Fleming Street\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=3.927\n|road={{jct|state=FL|SR|A1A|dir1=south|name1=Roosevelt Boulevard|location1=[[Key West International Airport|Airport]]|extra=airport|location2=Beaches}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Key West segment of SR&nbsp;A1A\n}}\n<!--4.531=0-->\n{{FLint\n|location=Stock Island<!--looks like the Key West city limits are the north ROW line-->\n|mile=4.586\n|road=MacDonald Drive\n|notes=Former [[Florida State Road 4A (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4A]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Boca Chica Key\n|mile=8.08\n|road=[[Naval Air Station Key West]]\n|notes=Interchange\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=East Rockland Key\n|mile=9.183\n|road=Rockland Drive&nbsp;\u2013 [[NAS Key West|NAS]] Truck Entrance\n|notes=Former US&nbsp;1 south\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Coppitt Key\n|mile=10.691\n|road=Boca Chica Road ([[County Road 941 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;941]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;941 (former [[Florida State Road 941|SR&nbsp;941]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Lower Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=16.955\n|road=Sugarloaf Boulevard ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former [[Florida State Road 939|SR&nbsp;939]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=19.970\n|road=State Road 939B<!--yes, that's the street name--> ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former SR&nbsp;939)\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Summerland Key\n|mile=25.197\n|road=East Shore Drive ([[County Road 942 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;942]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;942 (former [[Florida State Road 942|SR&nbsp;942]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Pine Key\n|mile=30.527\n|road=Key Deer Boulevard ([[County Road 940 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;940]] north)&nbsp;\u2013 [[National Key Deer Visitor Center]]\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;940 (former [[Florida State Road 940|SR&nbsp;940]])\n}}<!--31.079=0-->\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Bahia Honda Channel]]\n|mile=35.272\n|mile2=36.544\n|bridge=[[Bahia Honda Bridge]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Moser Channel]]\n|mile=40.011\n|mile2=46.804\n|bridge=[[Seven Mile Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Marathon\n|lspan=2\n|mile=48.059\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|931|county1=Monroe|dir1=north|name1=20th Street}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former [[Florida State Road 931|SR&nbsp;931]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=49.965\n|road=Sombrero Beach Road ([[County Road 931 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;931]] south)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sombrero Beach]]\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former SR&nbsp;931)\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Long Key Channel]]\n|mile=63.140\n|mile2=65.446\n|bridge=[[Long Key Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Islamorada\n|lspan=4\n|mile=84.344\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|905|county1=Monroe|dir1=north}}<!--no CR&nbsp;905 shields, but it's the street name-->\n|notes=Former SR&nbsp;4A;

De Anda gave new impetus to the word circa 2004 when she began to use it in her blog, ''Plaqueta'', and to jokingly describe her left-leaning friends.<ref name=Milenio />\n\nIn 2005, while de Anda attended the [[Facultad de Ciencias Pol\u00edticas y Sociales]], she created a satirical documentary titled ''Los Chairos'' which consisted of interviews with the \"chairos\" of Mexico City.<ref name=Chilango /> The popularity of her blog helped increase views for the video and helped disseminate the term. ''Chairo'' then began to deform from describing something cool and fun to a word used to indicate and mock those who were demonstrating against the system.<ref name=Chilango /> De Anda self-describes as a ''chaira'' and has expressed discontent with the word's usage to denigrate dissenting views.<ref name=Chilango />\n\n== Stereotype ==\nThe term has been further popularized by [[social media]] and now encompasses a large array of attributes. Most commonly seen as a 20-something college student, the term has also been extended to journalists, academics, writers and artists.\n\nCommon traits attributed to the ''chairo'' include: an expansive leftist-[[anarchist]] ideology, some sort of [[nationalist]] view (sometimes grounded on [[indigenismo]]), being indignant and fighting \"[[The Man|the System]]\" and [[globalization]].<ref name=Milenio /> They may be against what they believe to be \"[[Zionism]]\" and \"[[American imperialism]]\".<ref name=Milenio /> A ''chairo'' is sometimes seen as a radical that sympathizes with [[Socialism]] that is in line with [[Chavismo]].<ref name=Milenio /> On [[2006 Mexican general election|2006]] and [[2012 Mexican general election|2012 elections]] were stolen from [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]] through electoral fraud by the out going Mexican Presidents, in his swear in speech he thanked Pe\u00f1a Nieto for not doing the same.<ref name=Milenio /> The media outlets ''[[La Jornada]]'' and ''Aristegui Noticias'' (see [[Carmen Aristegui]]) .<ref name=Milenio /> are in favor of the group because  they live under a [[Fascist]] dictatorship.<ref name=Milenio />\n\nOther stereotypes include wearing [[Che Guevara shirt]]s and smoking [[marijuana]] or ingesting [[peyote]].<ref name=Chilango /> As well as adhering to the philosophy of [[Noam Chomsky]] and reading the works of [[Eduardo Galeano]].<ref name=Milenio />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Diccionario del espa\u00f1ol de M\u00e9xico]]'', compiled by the [[Colegio de M\u00e9xico]], a ''chairo'' is an offensive adjective used to describe individuals that defend social and political causes that are in contrast with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]], however they lack real commitment to the causes defended; an individual that is autosatisfied with their own attitudes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Define Colmex a los \"chairos\"|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/sociedad/2017/06/26/define-colmex-los-chairos|website=El Universal|accessdate=26 June 2017|language=es}}</ref><ref>Diccionario del Espa\u00f1ol de M\u00e9xico (DEM) http://dem.colmex.mx, El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, A.C.

is the second [[album]] by [[Ben Folds Five]], released in 1997. A [[remaster]] was made available on March 22, 2005. All of the extra tracks had been previously released (as b-sides, soundtrack contributions, etc.) except for a cover of [[the Buggles]] song \"[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]\", which is a staple of Ben Folds Five's live show.\n\n==Title, recording and cover==\n===Title===\nWhile recording the album, Folds told the ''Sheffield Electronic Press'' in November 1996 that the album would likely either be titled ''Cigarette'' or ''The Little Girl With Teeth''.<ref name=\"sheffield\">michaelbluejay.com: \"[http://michaelbluejay.com/bf5/i-sheffield.html Sheffield Electronic Press], Nov 1996.</ref> The title ''Whatever and Ever Amen'' comes from a line in the song \"[[Battle of Who Could Care Less]].\"{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Cover===\nThe album's original cover featured individual photos of Folds, Sledge, and Jessee, along with a hand-drawn Ben Folds Five logo, and a hand-drawn \"Whatever and Ever Amen.\" The cover of the 2005 remastered version moved the album\u2019s title from the top left corner to the center and added a fourth photo of all three bandmates sitting together.\n\n===Recording===\nThe album was recorded in the front room of a house in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Folds said, \"You can't go for perfection in a house. The spiritual comet of the song comes by every so often and lots of technical things are going to be going wrong when that happens. Our producer, Caleb is very good at knowing when the ghost blew through the house. People don't buy records for the accuracy.\" The first release for their new label, Epic, Folds said the record company did not get to hear the recording until it was finished, saying, \"they knew what they were getting into\".<ref>{{cite web| work= [[Rock's Backpages]] | title=Interview with Ben Folds (December 1997)|author=Kit Aitken | url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/interview-with-ben-folds-december-1997}}{{subscription required|s}}</ref>\n\n==Track notes==\nNear the end of the Nerdist podcast #132, Folds mentioned that the lyrics for \"Cigarette\" were taken from a newspaper article about a man who sought a divorce from his wife after finding out she had a brain tumour, on the basis that she was not the same person he had married. The \"sequel\" track, \"Fred Jones Part Two\", is on Folds' first solo album, ''[[Rockin' the Suburbs]]''.\n\nThe track \"Steven's Last Night in Town\" was written about Ben Folds' friend [[Stephen Short (record producer)|Stephen Short]], a Grammy-Award-winning record producer and manager.<ref name=\"nuvo\">''Nuvo'' article: \"[http://www.nuvo.net/MusicBlog/archives/2011/10/28/review-ben-folds-with-the-iso Review: Ben Folds with the ISO] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130222060337/http://www.nuvo.net/MusicBlog/archives/2011/10/28/review-ben-folds-with-the-iso |date=February 22, 2013 }}.\"</ref>\n\nAn early mix of \"Song for the Dumped\" appeared on the soundtrack album for the movie \"[[Mr. Wrong]]\", but the song did not actually appear in the movie.  The soundtrack was released on February 6, 1996, a full year before the release of \"Whatever and Ever Amen\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Mr-Wrong-Music-From-The-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/3230945|title=Various - Mr. Wrong (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|website=Discogs|accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Hidden tracks===\nThe first pressing of ''Whatever and Ever Amen'' features a clip of an actual argument in the studio between Folds, Sledge and Jessee, inserted between \"Brick\" and \"Song For the Dumped\". Speaking to ''The Shrubbery'' in 1999, Folds said that the clip \"was a painfully documented real argument that kept bringing up bad feelings. We decided to get rid of it and let the first pressings be collectors&nbsp;... Better to keep the band together. It was ugly.\"<ref name=\"shrub\">''The Shrubbery'': \"[http://www.theshrubbery.com/0599/ben.html The Big, Exciting Interview with Ben Folds].</ref>\n\nThe first pressing featured another [[hidden track]], on the album's last track, \"Evaporated\", and in the [[Pregap#Hidden Audio Tracks|negative space]] of track 1 on the Digitally Remastered version.
