The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web\n  |author=Indiana Code\n  |url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html\n  |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3\n  |accessdate=2008-09-16\n  |publisher=Government of Indiana|author-link=Indiana Code\n }}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web\n  |author=Indiana Code\n  |url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf\n  |title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2\n  |accessdate=2008-09-16\n  |publisher=Government of Indiana|author-link=Indiana Code\n }}</ref>\n\nThe executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>\n\nThe county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nThe county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>\n\nEach of the townships has a [[Indiana Township Trustee|trustee]] who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief, manages cemetery care, and performs farm assessment, among other duties.  The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board.  The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://unitedtownships.org/?page_id=95\n  |title=Government\n  |publisher=United Township Association of Indiana\n  |accessdate=2011-01-06\n}}</ref>\n\nDaviess County is part of [[Indiana's 8th congressional district]]; [[Indiana Senate]] districts 39 and 48;<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3006.htm\n  |title=Indiana Senate Districts\n  |publisher=State of Indiana\n  |accessdate=2011-01-23\n}}</ref> and [[Indiana House of Representatives]] districts 45, 63 and 64.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3005.htm\n  |title=Indiana House Districts\n  |publisher=State of Indiana\n  |accessdate=2011-01-23\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-05-14}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 The family comes back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet.
