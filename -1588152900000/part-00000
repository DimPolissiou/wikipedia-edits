[[Passendale|Passchendaele]] lies on the last ridge east of Ypres, {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Roulers (now [[Roeselare]]) junction of the [[Bruges]] (Brugge) to [[Kortrijk]] railway. The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]]. Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured, the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout (now [[Torhout]]) to Couckelaere ([[Koekelare]]).\n\nFurther operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport ([[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]), combined with an amphibious landing ([[Operation Hush]]), were to have reached [[Bruges]] and then the Dutch frontier. The resistance of the 4th Army, unusually wet weather in August, the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]], enabled the Germans to avoid the general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October. The campaign ended in November, when the [[Canadian Corps]] captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year. The [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] (Fourth Battle of Ypres) and the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] of 1918, were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.\n\nA campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. The British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], opposed the offensive, as did General [[Ferdinand Foch]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Army]]. [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July. Matters of dispute by the participants, writers and historians since 1917 include the wisdom of pursuing an offensive strategy in the wake of the [[Nivelle Offensive]], rather than waiting for the arrival of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) in France.\n\nThe choice of Flanders, its climate, the selection of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Hubert Gough]] and the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] to conduct the offensive, debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives, remain controversial. The time between the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] {{nowrap|(7\u201314 June)}} and the first Allied attack (the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]], 31 July), the extent to which the [[1917 French Army mutinies|internal troubles]] of the French armies influenced the British, the effect of the exceptional weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human costs of the campaign, are also debated.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Flanders===\n\n====1914====\n\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\n\nBelgium had been recognised in the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] (1839) as a sovereign and neutral state after the secession of the southern provinces of the Netherlands in 1830. The [[German invasion of Belgium]] on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the treaty, was the British ''[[casus belli]]'' against Germany.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|pp=414, 504}} British military operations in Belgium began with the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) at [[Mons]] on 22 August. Operations in [[Flanders]] began during the [[Race to the Sea]], reciprocal attempts by the French and German armies to turn their opponents' northern flank, through [[Picardy]], [[Artois]] and Flanders. On 10 October, Lieutenant-General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the [[German General Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]}} (OHL, supreme army command), ordered an attack towards Dunkirk and Calais, followed by a turn south behind the Allied armies, to gain a decisive victory.{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=102}} On 16 October, the Belgians and some French reinforcements began the defence of western Belgium and the French [[English Channel|Channel]] ports, at the [[Battle of the Yser]]. When the German offensive failed, Falkenhayn ordered the capture of [[Ypres]] to gain a local advantage.

Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=2}}\n\n====1916====\n\n{{main|Battle of Verdun|Battle of the Somme}}\n{{Campaignbox The Actions of Spring 1916}}\n\nMinor operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from the preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later attempts to divert Allied resources from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinghe and on 14 February at [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]] and Sanctuary Wood.

Haig had reservations and on 6 January Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to a breakthrough, the operations would be stopped and the British could move their forces north for the Flanders offensive, which was of great importance to the British government.{{sfn|Edmonds|Wynne|2010|p=14}} On 23 January, Haig wrote that it would take six weeks to move British troops and equipment to Flanders and on 14 March, noted that the Messines Ridge operation could begin in May.

The main French took place from 9 April to 9 May and failed to achieve a breakthrough.

After a brief period of success from 1 to 19 July, the Russian offensive was contained by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, which counter-attacked and forced the Russian armies to retreat. On the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast from 1 to 5 September 1917, the Germans attacked with their strategic reserve of six divisions and captured [[Riga]]. In [[Operation Albion]] (September\u2013October 1917), the Germans took the [[West Estonian Archipelago|islands]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The British and French commanders on the Western Front had to reckon on the German western army ({{lang|de|Westheer}}) being strengthened by reinforcements from the {{lang|de|Ostheer}} on the Eastern Front by late 1917.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=234}} Haig wished to exploit the diversion of German forces in Russia for as long as it continued and urged the British War Cabinet to commit the maximum amount of manpower and munitions to the battle in Flanders.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=290\u2013297}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Ypres salient===\n\nYpres is overlooked by [[Kemmelberg|Kemmel Hill]] in the south-west and from the east by a line of low hills running south-west to north-east Wytschaete ([[Wijtschate]]) and [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]] are to the east of Verbrandenmolen, [[Hooge, Ypres|Hooge]], [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]] and Passchendaele ([[Passendale]]). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, {{convert|7000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} from Ypres, while at [[Hollebeke]] the ridge is {{convert|4000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} distant and recedes to {{convert|7000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the plain; on the Ypres\u2013Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of [[Zonnebeke]], which has a gradient of {{nowrap|1:33.}} From Hooge and further east, the slope is {{nowrap|1:60 and}} near Hollebeke, it is {{nowrap|1:75; the}} heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-east to Messines ([[Mesen]]) with a gentle slope on the east side and a {{nowrap|1:10 decline}} westwards. Further south, is the muddy valley of the River Douve, [[Ploegsteert Wood]] (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem ([[Spanbroekmolen]]) Spur and on the east side, the Oosttaverne Spur, which is also parallel to the main ridge. The general aspect south and east of Ypres, is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele, into a featureless plain.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nPossession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres, gives an army ample scope for ground observation, [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade fire]] and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size, like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and [[Sanctuary Wood]]. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks tangled with barbed wire and more wire festooning the ground, which was full of shell-holes; fields in the gaps between the woods, were {{convert|800|\u2013|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and devoid of cover. The main road to Ypres from [[Poperinge]] to [[Vlamertinge]] is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. A century ago, roads in the area were unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses dotted along them. The lowland west of the ridge, was a mixture of meadow and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and a network of drainage ditches emptying into canals.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=129\u2013131}}\n\n=== Topography ===\n[[File:USMA - Third Battle of Ypres.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The progression of the battle and the general disposition of troops}}]]\nIn Flanders, sands, gravels and [[marl]]s predominate, covered by [[silt]]s in places. The coastal strip is sandy but a short way into the hinterland, the ground rises towards the Vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=140\u2013158}} Ypres is {{convert|20|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} above sea level; Bixschoote {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north is at {{convert|8.5|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

There is a low ridge from Messines, {{convert|80|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} at its highest point, running north-east past Clapham Junction at the west end of Gheluvelt plateau ({{frac|2|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{convert|65|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} and Gheluvelt, above {{convert|50|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} to Passchendaele, ({{frac|5|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{convert|50|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} declining from there to a plain further north.

Since 1914 much of the drainage had been destroyed, though some parts were restored by land drainage companies from England. The British considered the area drier than [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and Plugstreet Wood further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=125}} A study of weather data recorded at Lille, {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Ypres from {{nowrap|1867\u20131916,}} published in 1989, showed that August was more often dry than wet, that there was a trend towards dry autumns (September\u2013November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased since the 1860s.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nPreparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck\u2013Ypres rail line and the building of a new line from Bergues to Proven, which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917, gave the area the most efficient supply system of the BEF.{{sfn|Henniker|2009|p=273}} Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916, the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=3\u20134}} On 14 February 1917, Colonel [[Norman MacMullen]] of GHQ proposed that the plateau be taken by a mass tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel]] found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=25}}\n\nOn 9 February, Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army, suggested that Messines Ridge could be taken in one day and that the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau should be fundamental to the attack further north. He suggested that the southern attack from St Yves to Mont Sorrel should come first and that Mont Sorrel to Steenstraat should be attacked within {{nowrap|48\u201372 hours.}} After discussions with Rawlinson and Plumer and the incorporation of Haig's changes, Macmullen submitted his memorandum on 14 February. With amendments the memorandum became the ''GHQ 1917'' plan.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=17\u201319}} A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig gave his objectives to his army commanders, the wearing out the enemy, securing the Belgian coast and connecting with the Dutch frontier by capturing Passchendaele ridge, followed by an advance on Roulers and Operation Hush, an attack along the coast with a combined amphibious landing. If manpower and artillery were insufficient, only the first part of the plan might be fulfilled. On 30 April, Haig told Gough, the Fifth Army commander, that he would lead the Northern Operation and the coastal force, although Cabinet approval for the offensive was not granted until 21 June.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|pp=227\u2013231}}{{efn|After mutinies had begun in the French armies, the British cabinet felt compelled to endorse the Flanders offensive, in the hope that more refusals to fight could be \"averted by a great [military] success\".

Construction of a {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}} east of Menin northwards to Moorslede was also begun. From July 1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by the front position, the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}} (second position), {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} (fourth position), {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}} (fifth position) and {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}}, the sixth position (incomplete).

On 30 June, the army group Chief of Staff, [[General von Kuhl]], suggested a withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} along Passchendaele ridge, meeting the old front line in the north near Langemarck and Armenti\u00e8res in the south. Such a withdrawal would avoid a hasty retreat from Pilckem Ridge and force the British into a time-consuming redeployment. Lo\u00dfberg disagreed, believing that the British would launch a broad front offensive, that the ground east of the {{lang|de|Sehnenstellung}} was easy to defend and that the Menin road ridge could be held if it was made the {{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}} (point of main effort) of the German defensive system. Pilckem Ridge deprived the British of ground observation over the Steenbeek Valley, while the Germans could see the area from Passchendaele Ridge, allowing German infantry to be supported by observed artillery-fire.

The X Corps commander proposed an attack northward from In de Ster into the southern flank of the Germans opposite I Anzac Corps. The 7th Division commander objected, due to uncertainty about the situation and the many casualties suffered by the 21st Division on the right flank and Plumer changed his mind again.

Heavy rain and mud again made movement difficult and little artillery could be brought closer to the front. Allied troops were exhausted and morale had fallen. After a modest British advance, German counter-attacks recovered most of the ground lost opposite Passchendaele, except for an area on the right of the Wallemolen spur. North of Poelcappelle, the XIV Corps of the Fifth Army advanced along the Broembeek some way up the Watervlietbeek and the Stadenrevebeek streams and the Guards Division captured the west end of the Vijwegen spur, gaining observation over the south end of Houthulst Forest.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=341\u2013344}} There were {{nowrap|13,000 Allied}} casualties, including {{nowrap|2,735 New}} Zealanders, {{nowrap|845 of}} whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man's-land; it was one of the worst days in New Zealand military history.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=285}}<!--including {{nowrap|about 3,700 New}} Zealanders, {{nowrap|842 of}} whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man's-land;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/western-front-1917#heading5|title=1917: Arras, Messines and Passchendaele \u2013 1917: Arras, Messines and Passchendaele \u2013 NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>need printed sources for this if possible-->\n\nAt a conference on 13 October, Haig and the army commanders agreed that attacks would stop until the weather improved and roads could be extended, to carry more artillery and ammunition forward.

The attack was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank of the 35th Division and was intended to obstruct a possible German counter-attack on the left flank of the Canadian Corps as it attacked Passchendaele and the ridge. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division reached the fringe of Houthulst Forest but was outflanked and pushed back in places. German counter-attacks made after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October \u2013 10 November 1917).{{sfn|Perry|2014|pp=475\u2013486}}\n\n====Battle of La Malmaison====\n\n{{Main article|Battle of La Malmaison}}\n\nAfter numerous requests from Haig, Petain began the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by the Sixth Army (General [[Paul Maistre]]).

The 4th Canadian Division captured its objectives but was forced slowly to retire from Decline Copse, against German counter-attacks and communication failures between the Canadian and Australian units to the south.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=320}}\n\nThe second stage began on 30 October, to complete the previous stage and gain a base for the final assault on Passchendaele. The attackers on the southern flank quickly captured Crest Farm and sent patrols beyond the final objective into Passchendaele. The attack on the northern flank again met with exceptional German resistance. The 3rd Canadian Division captured Vapour Farm on the corps boundary, Furst Farm to the west of Meetcheele and the crossroads at Meetcheele but remained short of its objective. During a seven-day pause, the Second Army took over another section of the Fifth Army front adjoining the Canadian Corps. Three rainless days from {{nowrap|3\u20135 November}} eased preparation for the next stage, which began on the morning of 6 November, with the 1st Canadian Division and the [[2nd Canadian Division]].

The area was subjected to constant German artillery bombardments and its vulnerability to attack led to a suggestion by Brigadier C. F. Aspinall, that either the British should retire to the west side of the Gheluvelt Plateau or advance to broaden the salient towards Westroosebeke. Expanding the salient would make the troops in it less vulnerable to German artillery-fire and provide a better jumping off line for a resumption of the offensive in the spring of 1918. The British attacked towards Westroozebeke on the night of 1/2 December but the plan to mislead the Germans by not bombarding the German defences until eight minutes after the infantry began their advance came undone. The noise of the British assembly and the difficulty of moving across muddy and waterlogged ground had also alerted the Germans. In the moonlight, the Germans had seen the British troops when they were still {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} away. Some ground was captured and about {{nowrap|150 prisoners}} were taken but the attack on the redoubts failed and observation over the heads of the valleys on the east and north sides of the ridge was not achieved.{{sfn|LoCicero|2011|pp=155\u2013338}}\n\n====Action on the Polderhoek Spur====\n\n{{main|Action on the Polderhoek Spur}}\n\nThe attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917, was a local operation by the British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] (renamed from the Second Army on 8 November). Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|2nd New Zealand Brigade]] of the [[New Zealand Division]] attacked the low ridge, from which German observers could view the area from Cameron Covert to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. A New Zealand advance of {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} front, would shield the area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers on the Gheluvelt spur. Heavy artillery bombarded the ruins of Polderhoek Ch\u00e2teau and the pillboxes in the grounds to mislead the defenders and the attack was made in daylight as a ruse to surprise the Germans, who would be under cover sheltering from the routine bombardments. Smoke and gas bombardments on the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs on the flanks and the infantry attack began at the same time as the \"routine\" bombardment. The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders and the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge. A strong west wind ruined the smoke screens and the British artillery failed to suppress the German machine-guns. New Zealand machine-gunners repulsed a counter-attack but the New Zealand infantry were {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and the arrival of German reinforcements.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=304\u2013314}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n=== Analysis ===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+German casualties{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1956|p=96}}{{efn|German casualties were counted in ten-day periods.

By blaming  an individual, the rest of the German commanders were exculpated, which gave a false impression that OHL operated in a rational manner, when Ludendorff imposed another defensive scheme on 7 October. Boff wrote that this narrative was facile and that it avoided the problem faced by the Germans in late 1917. OHL had issued orders to change tactics again days before Lo\u00dfberg was blamed for giving new orders to the 4th Army. Boff also doubted that all of the divisions in Flanders could act on top-down changes. The 119th Division was in the front line from 11 August to 18 October and replied that new tactics were difficult to implement due to lack of training. The tempo of British attacks and the effect of attrition meant that although six divisions were sent to the 4th Army by 10 October, they were either novice units deficient in training or veteran formations with low morale after earlier defeats; good divisions had been diluted with too many replacements. Boff wrote that the Germans consciously sought tactical changes for an operational dilemma for want of an alternative. On 2 October, Rupprecht had ordered the 4th Army HQ to avoid over-centralising command, only to find that Lo\u00dfberg had issued an artillery plan detailing the deployment of individual batteries.{{sfn|Boff|2018|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\nAt a British conference on 13 October, a Third Army (General [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]]) scheme for an attack in mid-November was discussed.

Each brigade spent four days in the front line, four in support and four in reserve. The area was quiet apart from artillery-fire and in December the weather turned cold and snowy, which entailed a great effort to prevent [[trench foot]]. In January, spells of freezing cold were followed by warmer periods, one beginning on 15 January with torrential rain and gale-force winds, washing away plank roads and [[duckboard]] tracks.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|pp=167\u2013168}} Conditions in the salient improved with the completion of transport routes and the refurbishment of German pillboxes.

Worn-out divisions from the south had been sent to Flanders to recuperate closer to the coast. On 11 April, Plumer authorised a withdrawal of the southern flank of the Second Army. On 12 April, the VIII Corps HQ ordered the infantry retirement to begin that night and the 59th Division was replaced by part of the 41st Division and transferred south. The II Corps had begun to withdraw its artillery at the same time as VIII Corps on the night of 11/12 April and ordered the 36th and 30th divisions to conform to the VIII Corps retirement, which were completed by 13 April, without German interference.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=113\u2013114, 245, 275}} On 13 April, Plumer agreed to a retirement in the south side of the salient to a line from Mt Kemmel to Voormezeele [{{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Ypres], White Ch\u00e2teau [{{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Ypres] and Pilckem Ridge.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=299\u2013300, 319, 316, 326}} The 4th Army diary recorded that the withdrawal was discovered at {{nowrap|4:40 a.m.}} Next day, at the [[Battle of Merckem]], the Germans attacked from Houthulst Forest, north-east of Ypres and captured Kippe but were forced out by Belgian counter-attacks, supported by the II Corps artillery. On the afternoon of 27 April, the south end of the Second Army outpost line was driven in near Voormezeele and another British outpost line was established north-east of the village.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=337\u2013338, 342, 443}}\n\n===Commemoration===\n\n[[File:View from top of Tyne Cot.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Tyne Cot Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery and Memorial to the Missing}}]]\nThe [[Menin Gate|Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing]] commemorates those of all Commonwealth nations (except New Zealand) who died in the Ypres Salient and have no known grave. In the case of the United Kingdom only casualties before 16 August 1917 are commemorated on the memorial.

The British ''Battles Nomenclature Committee'' Report of 1922 called the Flanders Offensive of 1917 \"The Battle of Messines 1917\" {{nowrap|(7\u201314 June)}} and \"The Battles of Ypres 1917\" {{nowrap|(31 July \u2013 10 November).}} The battles are known to the British as the Battle of Messines 1917 {{nowrap|(7\u201314 June),}} the Battle of Pilckem Ridge {{nowrap|(31 July \u2013 2 August),}} the Battle of Langemarck {{nowrap|(16\u201318 August),}} the Battle of Menin Road Ridge {{nowrap|(20\u201325 September),}} the Battle of Polygon Wood {{nowrap|(26 September \u2013 3 October)}} the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October), the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October), the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October) and the Second Battle of Passchendaele {{nowrap|(26 October \u2013 10 November).}} In German works it is the ({{lang|de|Kampf um den Wijtschatebogen}}) (The Battle of the Wijtschate Salient) and the ({{lang|de|Flandernschlacht}}) (Battle of Flanders) in five periods, First Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(31 July \u2013 9 August),}} Second Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(9\u201325 August),}} Third Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(20 September \u2013 8 October)}} Fourth Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(9\u201321 October)}} and the Fifth Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(22 October \u2013 5 December).}}{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=1991|1p=iii|2a1=Sheldon|2y=2007|2p=xiv}}}} The battle took place on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], from July to November 1917, for control of the ridges south and east of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] city of [[Ypres]] in [[West Flanders]], as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917. [[Passendale|Passchendaele]] lies on the last ridge east of Ypres, {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Roulers (now [[Roeselare]]) junction of the [[Bruges]] (Brugge) to [[Kortrijk]] railway. The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]]. Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured, the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout (now [[Torhout]]) to Couckelaere ([[Koekelare]]).\n\nFurther operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport ([[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]), combined with an amphibious landing ([[Operation Hush]]), were to have reached [[Bruges]] and then the Dutch frontier. The resistance of the 4th Army, unusually wet weather in August, the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]], enabled the Germans to avoid the general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October. The campaign ended in November, when the [[Canadian Corps]] captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year. The [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] (Fourth Battle of Ypres) and the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] of 1918, were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.\n\nA campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. The British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], opposed the offensive, as did General [[Ferdinand Foch]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Army]]. [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July. Matters of dispute by the participants, writers and historians since 1917 include the wisdom of pursuing an offensive strategy in the wake of the [[Nivelle Offensive]], rather than waiting for the arrival of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) in France.\n\nThe choice of Flanders, its climate, the selection of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Hubert Gough]] and the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] to conduct the offensive, debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives, remain controversial. The time between the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] {{nowrap|(7\u201314 June)}} and the first Allied attack (the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]], 31 July), the extent to which the [[1917 French Army mutinies|internal troubles]] of the French armies influenced the British, the effect of the exceptional weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human costs of the campaign, are also debated.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Flanders===\n\n====1914====\n\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\n\nBelgium had been recognised in the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] (1839) as a sovereign and neutral state after the secession of the southern provinces of the Netherlands in 1830. The [[German invasion of Belgium]] on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the treaty, was the British ''[[casus belli]]'' against Germany.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|pp=414, 504}} British military operations in Belgium began with the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) at [[Mons]] on 22 August. Operations in [[Flanders]] began during the [[Race to the Sea]], reciprocal attempts by the French and German armies to turn their opponents' northern flank, through [[Picardy]], [[Artois]] and Flanders. On 10 October, Lieutenant-General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the [[German General Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]}} (OHL, supreme army command), ordered an attack towards Dunkirk and Calais, followed by a turn south behind the Allied armies, to gain a decisive victory.{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=102}} On 16 October, the Belgians and some French reinforcements began the defence of western Belgium and the French [[English Channel|Channel]] ports, at the [[Battle of the Yser]]. When the German offensive failed, Falkenhayn ordered the capture of [[Ypres]] to gain a local advantage. By 18 November, the [[First Battle of Ypres]] had also ended in failure, at a cost of {{nowrap|160,000 German}} casualties.{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=104}} In December 1914, the [[British Admiralty]] began discussions with the [[War Office]], for a combined operation to re-occupy the Belgian coast but were obliged to conform to French strategy and participate in offensives further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=2}}\n\n====1915====\n\nLarge British offensive operations in Flanders were not possible in 1915, due to a lack of resources.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=137}} The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] (22 April \u2013 15 May 1915), making the Ypres [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] more costly to defend.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=1}} [[Sir Douglas Haig]] succeeded [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December 1915.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=12\u201313}} A week after his appointment, Haig met Vice-Admiral Sir [[Reginald Bacon]], who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by [[Flanders U-boat flotillas|German U-boats]]. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=2}}\n\n====1916====\n\n{{main|Battle of Verdun|Battle of the Somme}}\n{{Campaignbox The Actions of Spring 1916}}\n\nMinor operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from the preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later attempts to divert Allied resources from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinghe and on 14 February at [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]] and Sanctuary Wood. There were actions from {{nowrap|14\u201315 February}} and {{nowrap|1\u20134 March}} at [[The Bluff, Ypres|The Bluff]], {{nowrap|27 March \u2013 16}} April at the [[Sint-Elooi|St Eloi Craters]] and the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]] from {{nowrap|2\u201313 June.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|pp=163\u2013245}} In January 1917, the Second Army (General [[Herbert Plumer]]) with the II Anzac, IX, X and VIII corps, held the Western Front in Flanders from Laventie to Boesinghe, with eleven divisions and up to two in reserve. There was much trench mortaring, mining and raiding by both sides and from January to May, the Second Army had {{nowrap|20,000 casualties.}} In May, reinforcements began arriving to Flanders from the south; the II Corps headquarters and {{nowrap|17 divisions}} had arrived by the end of the month.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\nIn January 1916, Plumer began to plan offensives against [[Messines Ridge]], [[Lille]] and Houthulst Forest.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=31}} General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]] was also ordered to plan an attack from the Ypres Salient on 4 February; planning continued but the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme took up the rest of the year.{{sfn|Terraine |1977|pp=14\u201315}} In November 1916, Haig, the French commander-in-chief [[Joseph Joffre]] and the other Allies met at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]]. The commanders agreed on a strategy of simultaneous attacks, to overwhelm the [[Central Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]], [[Eastern Front of World War I|Eastern]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian]] fronts, by the first fortnight of February 1917.{{sfn|Hart|Steel|2001|p=30}} A meeting in London of the Admiralty and the General Staff urged that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917 and Joffre replied on 8 December, agreeing to a Flanders campaign after the spring offensive.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=21}} The plan for a year of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] offensives on the Western Front, with the main effort to be made in the summer by the BEF, was scrapped by the new French Commander-in-Chief [[Robert Nivelle]] in favour of a return to a strategy of decisive battle.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n===Allied strategy===\n\n{{see also|Western Front (World War I)|Nivelle Offensive}}\n\nNivelle planned preliminary offensives to pin German reserves by the British at [[Arras]] and the French between the Somme and the [[Oise]], then a French breakthrough offensive on the [[Aisne]], followed by pursuit and exploitation. Haig had reservations and on 6 January Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to a breakthrough, the operations would be stopped and the British could move their forces north for the Flanders offensive, which was of great importance to the British government.{{sfn|Edmonds|Wynne|2010|p=14}} On 23 January, Haig wrote that it would take six weeks to move British troops and equipment to Flanders and on 14 March, noted that the Messines Ridge operation could begin in May. On 21 March, he wrote to Nivelle that it would take two months to prepare the offensive from Messines to Steenstraat but that the Messines operation could be ready in five or six weeks. The main French took place from 9 April to 9 May and failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 16 May, Haig wrote that he had divided the Flanders operation into two phases, one to take Messines Ridge and the main attack several weeks later.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=31, 55, 94}} British determination to clear the Belgian coast took on more urgency, after the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=15}} On 1 May 1917, Haig wrote that the Nivelle Offensive had weakened the German army but that an attempt at a decisive blow would be premature.{{sfn|Powell|2004|p=169}} The wearing-out process would continue on a front where the Germans had no room to retreat.

After a brief period of success from 1 to 19 July, the Russian offensive was contained by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, which counter-attacked and forced the Russian armies to retreat. On the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast from 1 to 5 September 1917, the Germans attacked with their strategic reserve of six divisions and captured [[Riga]]. In [[Operation Albion]] (September\u2013October 1917), the Germans took the [[West Estonian Archipelago|islands]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The British and French commanders on the Western Front had to reckon on the German western army ({{lang|de|Westheer}}) being strengthened by reinforcements from the {{lang|de|Ostheer}} on the Eastern Front by late 1917.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=234}} Haig wished to exploit the diversion of German forces in Russia for as long as it continued and urged the British War Cabinet to commit the maximum amount of manpower and munitions to the battle in Flanders.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=290\u2013297}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Ypres salient===\n\nYpres is overlooked by [[Kemmelberg|Kemmel Hill]] in the south-west and from the east by a line of low hills running south-west to north-east Wytschaete ([[Wijtschate]]) and [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]] are to the east of Verbrandenmolen, [[Hooge, Ypres|Hooge]], [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]] and Passchendaele ([[Passendale]]). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, {{convert|7000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} from Ypres, while at [[Hollebeke]] the ridge is {{convert|4000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} distant and recedes to {{convert|7000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the plain; on the Ypres\u2013Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of [[Zonnebeke]], which has a gradient of {{nowrap|1:33.}} From Hooge and further east, the slope is {{nowrap|1:60 and}} near Hollebeke, it is {{nowrap|1:75; the}} heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-east to Messines ([[Mesen]]) with a gentle slope on the east side and a {{nowrap|1:10 decline}} westwards. Further south, is the muddy valley of the River Douve, [[Ploegsteert Wood]] (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem ([[Spanbroekmolen]]) Spur and on the east side, the Oosttaverne Spur, which is also parallel to the main ridge. The general aspect south and east of Ypres, is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele, into a featureless plain.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nPossession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres, gives an army ample scope for ground observation, [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade fire]] and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size, like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and [[Sanctuary Wood]]. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks tangled with barbed wire and more wire festooning the ground, which was full of shell-holes; fields in the gaps between the woods, were {{convert|800|\u2013|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and devoid of cover. The main road to Ypres from [[Poperinge]] to [[Vlamertinge]] is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. A century ago, roads in the area were unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses dotted along them. The lowland west of the ridge, was a mixture of meadow and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and a network of drainage ditches emptying into canals.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=129\u2013131}}\n\n=== Topography ===\n[[File:USMA - Third Battle of Ypres.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The progression of the battle and the general disposition of troops}}]]\nIn Flanders, sands, gravels and [[marl]]s predominate, covered by [[silt]]s in places. The coastal strip is sandy but a short way into the hinterland, the ground rises towards the Vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=140\u2013158}} Ypres is {{convert|20|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} above sea level; Bixschoote {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north is at {{convert|8.5|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}}. To the east the land is at {{convert|20|\u2013|25|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} for several miles, with the Steenbeek river at {{convert|15|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} near St Julien. There is a low ridge from Messines, {{convert|80|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} at its highest point, running north-east past Clapham Junction at the west end of Gheluvelt plateau ({{frac|2|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{convert|65|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} and Gheluvelt, above {{convert|50|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} to Passchendaele, ({{frac|5|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{convert|50|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} declining from there to a plain further north. Gradients vary from negligible, to {{nowrap|1:60}} at Hooge and {{nowrap|1:33}} at Zonnebeke.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=141}}\n\nUnderneath the soil is [[London clay]], sand and silt; according to the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] categories of ''sand'', ''sandy soils'' and ''well-balanced soils'', Messines ridge is well-balanced soil and the ground around Ypres is sandy soil.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=142}} The ground is drained by many streams, canals and ditches, which need regular maintenance. Since 1914 much of the drainage had been destroyed, though some parts were restored by land drainage companies from England. The British considered the area drier than [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and Plugstreet Wood further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=125}} A study of weather data recorded at Lille, {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Ypres from {{nowrap|1867\u20131916,}} published in 1989, showed that August was more often dry than wet, that there was a trend towards dry autumns (September\u2013November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased since the 1860s.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nPreparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck\u2013Ypres rail line and the building of a new line from Bergues to Proven, which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917, gave the area the most efficient supply system of the BEF.{{sfn|Henniker|2009|p=273}} Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916, the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=3\u20134}} On 14 February 1917, Colonel [[Norman MacMullen]] of GHQ proposed that the plateau be taken by a mass tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel]] found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=25}}\n\nOn 9 February, Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army, suggested that Messines Ridge could be taken in one day and that the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau should be fundamental to the attack further north. He suggested that the southern attack from St Yves to Mont Sorrel should come first and that Mont Sorrel to Steenstraat should be attacked within {{nowrap|48\u201372 hours.}} After discussions with Rawlinson and Plumer and the incorporation of Haig's changes, Macmullen submitted his memorandum on 14 February. With amendments the memorandum became the ''GHQ 1917'' plan.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=17\u201319}} A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig gave his objectives to his army commanders, the wearing out the enemy, securing the Belgian coast and connecting with the Dutch frontier by capturing Passchendaele ridge, followed by an advance on Roulers and Operation Hush, an attack along the coast with a combined amphibious landing. If manpower and artillery were insufficient, only the first part of the plan might be fulfilled. On 30 April, Haig told Gough, the Fifth Army commander, that he would lead the Northern Operation and the coastal force, although Cabinet approval for the offensive was not granted until 21 June.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|pp=227\u2013231}}{{efn|After mutinies had begun in the French armies, the British cabinet felt compelled to endorse the Flanders offensive, in the hope that more refusals to fight could be \"averted by a great [military] success\".

On 9 June, [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Crown Prince Rupprecht]] proposed a withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line east of Messines. Construction of defences began but was terminated after [[Fritz von Lo\u00dfberg]] was appointed Chief of Staff of the 4th Army.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=282\u2013283}} Lo\u00dfberg rejected the proposed withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line and ordered that the front line east of the ''Oosttaverne'' line be held rigidly. The {{lang|de|Flandernstellung}} (Flanders Position) along Passchendaele Ridge, in front of the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line, would become {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} and a new position, {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}}, would run west of Menin, northwards to Passchendaele. Construction of a {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}} east of Menin northwards to Moorslede was also begun. From July 1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by the front position, the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}} (second position), {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} (fourth position), {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}} (fifth position) and {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}}, the sixth position (incomplete). Between the German defences lay villages such as Zonnebeke and Passchendaele, which were fortified and prepared for all-round defence.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=284}}\n\nOn 25 June, [[Erich Ludendorff]], the First Quartermaster General, suggested to Crown Prince Rupprecht that Group Ypres should withdraw to the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}}, leaving only outposts in the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}}. On 30 June, the army group Chief of Staff, [[General von Kuhl]], suggested a withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} along Passchendaele ridge, meeting the old front line in the north near Langemarck and Armenti\u00e8res in the south. Such a withdrawal would avoid a hasty retreat from Pilckem Ridge and force the British into a time-consuming redeployment. Lo\u00dfberg disagreed, believing that the British would launch a broad front offensive, that the ground east of the {{lang|de|Sehnenstellung}} was easy to defend and that the Menin road ridge could be held if it was made the {{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}} (point of main effort) of the German defensive system. Pilckem Ridge deprived the British of ground observation over the Steenbeek Valley, while the Germans could see the area from Passchendaele Ridge, allowing German infantry to be supported by observed artillery-fire.

The attack was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank of the 35th Division and was intended to obstruct a possible German counter-attack on the left flank of the Canadian Corps as it attacked Passchendaele and the ridge. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division reached the fringe of Houthulst Forest but was outflanked and pushed back in places. German counter-attacks made after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October \u2013 10 November 1917).{{sfn|Perry|2014|pp=475\u2013486}}\n\n====Battle of La Malmaison====\n\n{{Main article|Battle of La Malmaison}}\n\nAfter numerous requests from Haig, Petain began the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by the Sixth Army (General [[Paul Maistre]]).

The attackers on the southern flank quickly captured Crest Farm and sent patrols beyond the final objective into Passchendaele. The attack on the northern flank again met with exceptional German resistance. The 3rd Canadian Division captured Vapour Farm on the corps boundary, Furst Farm to the west of Meetcheele and the crossroads at Meetcheele but remained short of its objective. During a seven-day pause, the Second Army took over another section of the Fifth Army front adjoining the Canadian Corps.

The area was subjected to constant German artillery bombardments and its vulnerability to attack led to a suggestion by Brigadier C. F. Aspinall, that either the British should retire to the west side of the Gheluvelt Plateau or advance to broaden the salient towards Westroosebeke. Expanding the salient would make the troops in it less vulnerable to German artillery-fire and provide a better jumping off line for a resumption of the offensive in the spring of 1918. The British attacked towards Westroozebeke on the night of 1/2 December but the plan to mislead the Germans by not bombarding the German defences until eight minutes after the infantry began their advance came undone. The noise of the British assembly and the difficulty of moving across muddy and waterlogged ground had also alerted the Germans. In the moonlight, the Germans had seen the British troops when they were still {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} away. Some ground was captured and about {{nowrap|150 prisoners}} were taken but the attack on the redoubts failed and observation over the heads of the valleys on the east and north sides of the ridge was not achieved.{{sfn|LoCicero|2011|pp=155\u2013338}}\n\n====Action on the Polderhoek Spur====\n\n{{main|Action on the Polderhoek Spur}}\n\nThe attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917, was a local operation by the British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] (renamed from the Second Army on 8 November). Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|2nd New Zealand Brigade]] of the [[New Zealand Division]] attacked the low ridge, from which German observers could view the area from Cameron Covert to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. A New Zealand advance of {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} front, would shield the area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers on the Gheluvelt spur. Heavy artillery bombarded the ruins of Polderhoek Ch\u00e2teau and the pillboxes in the grounds to mislead the defenders and the attack was made in daylight as a ruse to surprise the Germans, who would be under cover sheltering from the routine bombardments. Smoke and gas bombardments on the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs on the flanks and the infantry attack began at the same time as the \"routine\" bombardment. The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders and the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge. A strong west wind ruined the smoke screens and the British artillery failed to suppress the German machine-guns. New Zealand machine-gunners repulsed a counter-attack but the New Zealand infantry were {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and the arrival of German reinforcements.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=304\u2013314}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n=== Analysis ===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+German casualties{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1956|p=96}}{{efn|German casualties were counted in ten-day periods.

By blaming  an individual, the rest of the German commanders were exculpated, which gave a false impression that OHL operated in a rational manner, when Ludendorff imposed another defensive scheme on 7 October. Boff wrote that this narrative was facile and that it avoided the problem faced by the Germans in late 1917. OHL had issued orders to change tactics again days before Lo\u00dfberg was blamed for giving new orders to the 4th Army. Boff also doubted that all of the divisions in Flanders could act on top-down changes. The 119th Division was in the front line from 11 August to 18 October and replied that new tactics were difficult to implement due to lack of training. The tempo of British attacks and the effect of attrition meant that although six divisions were sent to the 4th Army by 10 October, they were either novice units deficient in training or veteran formations with low morale after earlier defeats; good divisions had been diluted with too many replacements. Boff wrote that the Germans consciously sought tactical changes for an operational dilemma for want of an alternative. On 2 October, Rupprecht had ordered the 4th Army HQ to avoid over-centralising command, only to find that Lo\u00dfberg had issued an artillery plan detailing the deployment of individual batteries.{{sfn|Boff|2018|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\nAt a British conference on 13 October, a Third Army (General [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]]) scheme for an attack in mid-November was discussed.

The II Corps had begun to withdraw its artillery at the same time as VIII Corps on the night of 11/12 April and ordered the 36th and 30th divisions to conform to the VIII Corps retirement, which were completed by 13 April, without German interference.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=113\u2013114, 245, 275}} On 13 April, Plumer agreed to a retirement in the south side of the salient to a line from Mt Kemmel to Voormezeele [{{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Ypres], White Ch\u00e2teau [{{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Ypres] and Pilckem Ridge.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=299\u2013300, 319, 316, 326}} The 4th Army diary recorded that the withdrawal was discovered at {{nowrap|4:40 a.m.}} Next day, at the [[Battle of Merckem]], the Germans attacked from Houthulst Forest, north-east of Ypres and captured Kippe but were forced out by Belgian counter-attacks, supported by the II Corps artillery. On the afternoon of 27 April, the south end of the Second Army outpost line was driven in near Voormezeele and another British outpost line was established north-east of the village.{{sfn|Edmonds|Davies|Maxwell-Hyslop|1995|pp=337\u2013338, 342, 443}}\n\n===Commemoration===\n\n[[File:View from top of Tyne Cot.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Tyne Cot Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery and Memorial to the Missing}}]]\nThe [[Menin Gate|Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing]] commemorates those of all Commonwealth nations (except New Zealand) who died in the Ypres Salient and have no known grave. In the case of the United Kingdom only casualties before 16 August 1917 are commemorated on the memorial. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at [[Tyne Cot Cemetery]]. There is a New Zealand Memorial marking where New Zealand troops fought at Gravenstafel Ridge on 4 October, located on Roeselarestraat.{{sfn|NZG|nd|nopp=y}} There are numerous tributes and memorials in Australia and New Zealand to Anzac soldiers who died in the battle, including plaques at the [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]] railway stations. The Canadian Corps' participation in the Second Battle of Passchendaele is commemorated with the [[Passchendaele Memorial]] at site of the Crest Farm on the south-west fringe of Passchendaele village.{{sfn|Vance|1997|p=66}}\n\nOne of the newest monuments to be dedicated to the fighting contribution of a group is the [[Celtic Cross]] memorial, commemorating the Scottish contribution to the fighting in Flanders during the Great War. This memorial is on Frezenberg Ridge where the 9th (Scottish) Division and the 15th (Scottish) Division fought during the Third Battle of Ypres. The monument was dedicated by [[Linda Fabiani]], the Minister for Europe of the [[Scottish Parliament]], during the late summer of 2007, the 90th anniversary of the battle.{{sfn|SG|2007|nopp=y}} In July 2017 a two-day event was organised in Ypres to mark the centenary of the battle. Members of the [[British royal family|British Royal family]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] joined the ceremonies, which started in the evening of 30 July with the service at Menin Gate, followed by ceremonies at the Market Square. On the following day, a ceremony was held at Tyne Cot cemetery, headed by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]].{{sfn|DT|2017|nopp=y}}{{sfn|DT|2017a|nopp=y}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War I}}\n* ''[[Passchendaele (film)|Passchendaele]]'', a 2008 Canadian film with the battle as a backdrop.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Albertini|1952}}\n|title=The Origins of the War of 1914 |volume=III |last=Albertini |first=L. |authorlink=Luigi Albertini |year=2005 |orig-year=1952 |publisher=Enigma Books |location=New York |edition=repr. |isbn=978-1-929631-33-9}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Atkinson|2009}}\n|title=The Seventh Division 1914\u20131918 |last=Atkinson |first=C.

This makes the Guard Hussars one of the oldest regiment of [[hussar]]s in the world still operational, it is also the only hussars in mounted parade uniform to still wear the slung and braided [[pelisse]] which was formerly characteristic of this class of cavalry. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the [[Den Kongelige Livgarde]]) to be classed as 'Guards'; in this case, the [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron|Mounted Squadron]] perform the same role as the [[Household Cavalry]] do in the [[British Army]].\n\nFrom 1961 to 1972 the regiment was responsible for two armoured battalions, one recon battalion. From 1972\u20132000 the regiment was responsible for one armoured, one mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and one infantry battalions. From 2000\u20132004 the regiment was responsible for two armoured, two mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and two infantry battalions. From 1992\u20132004 the regiment also had to form two light Reconnaissance Squadrons assigned to the [[1st Zealand Brigade]] and [[Danish International Brigade]].\n\n=== 2001 amalgamation===\n\nAs part of the [[Danish Defence Agreement 2000\u201304|Defence Agreement 2000\u201304]], it was decided to merge the Guard Hussar Regiment with the [[Zealand Life Regiment]] and the [[Danish Life Regiment]]. With this amalgamation of the three infantry regiments; the name and history of the new regiment had to be decided. This led to what the media called \"the Colonels' War\" ({{lang-da|Oberstkrigen}}), with the three colonels fighting for their regiment's name and history to survive.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Br\u00f8ndum |first1=Christian |title=Dronningen fejrer tvivlsomt jubil\u00e6um |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/samfund/dronningen-fejrer-tvivlsomt-jubilaeum |website=b.dk |publisher=Berlingske Media |accessdate=28 September 2018 |language=Danish |date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Br\u00f8ndum |first1=Christian |editor1-last=Bauneh\u00f8j |editor1-first=Birgit |title=Forsvaret g\u00e5r ikke med rygm\u00e6rker |journal=Forsvarsavisen |date=November 2016 |volume=5 |issue=8 |page=7 |url=https://www2.forsvaret.dk/omos/publikationer/forsvarsavisen/Documents/Forsvarsavisen%2008%202016%20small.pdf |accessdate=21 November 2018 |publisher=V\u00e6rnsf\u00e6lles Forsvarskommando}}</ref>\nThe Chief of Defence, [[Christian Hvidt]], ordered the old insignia removed, which was not customary.

This makes the Guard Hussars one of the oldest regiment of [[hussar]]s in the world still operational, it is also the only hussars in mounted parade uniform to still wear the slung and braided [[pelisse]] which was formerly characteristic of this class of cavalry. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the [[Den Kongelige Livgarde]]) to be classed as 'Guards'; in this case, the [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron|Mounted Squadron]] perform the same role as the [[Household Cavalry]] do in the [[British Army]].\n\nFrom 1961 to 1972 the regiment was responsible for two armoured battalions, one recon battalion. From 1972\u20132000 the regiment was responsible for one armoured, one mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and one infantry battalions. From 2000\u20132004 the regiment was responsible for two armoured, two mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and two infantry battalions. From 1992\u20132004 the regiment also had to form two light Reconnaissance Squadrons assigned to the [[1st Zealand Brigade]] and [[Danish International Brigade]].\n\n=== 2001 amalgamation===\n\nAs part of the [[Danish Defence Agreement 2000\u201304|Defence Agreement 2000\u201304]], it was decided to merge the Guard Hussar Regiment with the [[Zealand Life Regiment]] and the [[Danish Life Regiment]]. With this amalgamation of the three infantry regiments; the name and history of the new regiment had to be decided. This led to what the media called \"the Colonels' War\" ({{lang-da|Oberstkrigen}}), with the three colonels fighting for their regiment's name and history to survive.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Br\u00f8ndum |first1=Christian |title=Dronningen fejrer tvivlsomt jubil\u00e6um |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/samfund/dronningen-fejrer-tvivlsomt-jubilaeum |website=b.dk |publisher=Berlingske Media |accessdate=28 September 2018 |language=Danish |date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Br\u00f8ndum |first1=Christian |editor1-last=Bauneh\u00f8j |editor1-first=Birgit |title=Forsvaret g\u00e5r ikke med rygm\u00e6rker |journal=Forsvarsavisen |date=November 2016 |volume=5 |issue=8 |page=7 |url=https://www2.forsvaret.dk/omos/publikationer/forsvarsavisen/Documents/Forsvarsavisen%2008%202016%20small.pdf |accessdate=21 November 2018 |publisher=V\u00e6rnsf\u00e6lles Forsvarskommando}}</ref>\nThe Chief of Defence, [[Christian Hvidt]], ordered the old insignia removed, which was not customary.

A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]].

Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.\n*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.\n*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]].

[[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.\n\nThe energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels.

Allison]], who first described Willamette Silt soil in 1953 and noted its similarity to soils on the floor of former [[Lake Lewis]] in Eastern Washington. Allison is also known for his work in the 1930s documenting the hundreds of non-native boulders (called [[Glacial erratic|erratics]]) washed down by the floods, rafted on [[iceberg]]s and deposited on the valley bottom and in a ring around the lower hills surrounding the Willamette Valley. One of the most prominent of these is the [[Erratic Rock State Natural Site|Bellevue Erratic]], just off [[Oregon Route 18]] west of McMinnville.<ref name=Cataclysms/>\n\nIt is also believed that the [[Willamette Meteorite]] was rafted by flood and ice to the location near [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]] where it was found in 1902.\n\n==Geography==\nThe valley may be loosely defined as the broad plain of the Willamette, bounded on the west by the Oregon Coast Range and on the east by the Cascade Range. It is bounded on the south by the Calapooya Mountains, which separate the headwaters of the Willamette from the [[Umpqua River]] valley about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} south of [[Hidden Valley, Oregon|Hidden Valley]].  [[Interstate 5]] runs the length of the valley, linking its major communities.\n\nBecause of differing cultural and political interests, the [[Portland metropolitan area]] and [[Tualatin Valley|Tualatin River valley]] are often not included in the local use of the term.  Additionally, the east slopes of the Coast Ranges and the west slopes of the Cascade Range from [[Oakridge, Oregon|Oakridge]] to [[Detroit Lake]] can be considered part of the Willamette Valley in a cultural sense, despite being mountainous areas.\n\nCities in the valley include, from south to north, [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]], Eugene, Corvallis, [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], [[Dallas, Oregon|Dallas]], Salem, Keizer, McMinnville, and [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. Parts of the following counties, from south to north, lie within the valley: [[Douglas County, Oregon|Douglas]], [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane]], [[Linn County, Oregon|Linn]], [[Benton County, Oregon|Benton]], [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]], [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion]], [[Yamhill County, Oregon|Yamhill]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]]. Sometimes the area around Albany and Corvallis and surrounding Benton and Linn counties is referred to locally as the Mid-Valley.<ref name=MVOnline>{{cite news |url= http://www.mvourtown.com/ |title= Mid-Valley Our Town |newspaper= [[Albany Democrat-Herald]] |accessdate= September 4, 2008}}</ref> Marion, Polk, and other counties are sometimes included in the definition of the Mid-Valley.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Willamette Valley fog.JPG|left|thumb|240px|alt=Fog in valley|Light fog in the southern valley]]\nThe climate of the Willamette Valley is a temperate oceanic '''climate''' (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfb''), which features cool summers, and wet winters with frequent overcast and cloudy skies. \n\nTemperatures are predictable throughout the year, with daytime highs frequently reaching the low to mid 80s in the summer and the mid 40s in the winter. Lengthy stretches of {{convert|90|F|C}} days occur every summer, occasionally reaching {{convert|100|F|C}}. Very cold days where the daytime high fails to rise above freezing are rare and may occur only two or three days per year, and occasionally not at all, especially in the lowest elevations of the valley. Temperatures of {{convert|5|F|C}} or lower occur only about once every 25 years. Spring and fall days are consistently between 50 and 70 degrees, with occasional surges of summer-like or winter-like temperatures that rarely last more than a week.<ref name = \"climatologist\"/>\n\nPrecipitation varies considerably across the valley and is closely correlated with elevation. Annual totals range from {{convert|36|in|mm}} at the lowest elevations to more than {{convert|80|in|mm}} in the foothills. Eugene, at the southern end of the valley, is {{convert|425|ft|m}} above sea level and receives 46 inches per year. Conversely, at the northern end of the valley, Portland is {{convert|50|ft|m}} above sea level and receives only 36 inches per year.

Notable floods include the [[Great Flood of 1862]], events in 1899, the [[Christmas flood of 1964]], and the [[Willamette Valley Flood of 1996]].  Part of its [[floodplain]] is a [[National Natural Landmark]] called the [[Willamette Floodplain]].\n\nHistorically, the Willamette Valley forests were mostly an [[oak savanna]]\u2014tall grasslands with scattered [[Garry oak]]s and groves of [[coast Douglas-fir]]. The river floodplains contained extensive wetlands, stands of willow, alder, and cottonwood, and gallery forests. This landscape was maintained by the Native American inhabitants of the valley who set frequent fires that encouraged the open grasslands and killed young trees. The American settlers of the region, since the 19th&nbsp;century, suppressed fires and converted much of the valley to agriculture, which has caused much of the former grassland and savanna to revert to closed-canopy forest.  Less than one-tenth of one percent of the original savanna vegetation remains. The remaining enclaves include a section of Garry oak savanna preserved at [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]] in Eugene. North Pacific Oak Woodland is a major forest alliance, extending through the Willamette Valley and southward to the Klamath Range of Northern California.<ref>C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Quercus Kelloggii'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

From the 1841 [[Oregon Trail]] opening, when the effort of many years finally widened the fur traders' [[mule]] trails into an improved rough road just capable of carrying the width of a wagon, settlers charged into the region along the new trail, creating new settlements centered about [[Oregon City]] as the early capital, even before [[Oregon boundary dispute|ownership of the region]] was settled. So many people came that the valley led the way to achieving statehood less than 16 years after it was claimed by the United States in 1846. A small part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion is in southwestern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] around the city of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], which was once the site of an early colonial-era settlement{{mdash}}[[Fort Vancouver]]. The Willamette Valley{{mdash}}served with its sawmills, lush productive farms, handy river transport network, and nearby timber and mineral resources{{mdash}}developed naturally as a cultural and major commercial hub, as the [[Oregon Country]] became the Oregon Territory.\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] controlled the fur trade in the valley and the rest of Oregon Country in the 1820s and 1830s from its [[Columbia District]] headquarters at Fort Vancouver.  Joint U.S.\u2013British occupancy, in effect since the [[Treaty of 1818]], ended in 1846 with the [[Oregon Treaty]].\n\nThe Willamette Valley was connected to California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] by the [[Siskiyou Trail]].

Throughout the 19th century it was the destination of choice for the oxen-drawn [[wagon train]]s of emigrants who made the perilous journey along the [[Oregon Trail]].\n\nToday the valley is often considered synonymous with \"Oregon Wine Country\", as it contains more than {{convert|19,000|acres|}} of vineyards and [[Willamette Valley AVA|500+ wineries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://willamettewines.com/facts-figures|title=Willamette Valley Facts and Figures - Willamette Valley Wineries|author=|date=|website=willamettewines.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\nMuch of the Willamette's fertility is derived from a series of massive ice-age floods that came from [[Lake Missoula]] in [[Montana]] and scoured across [[Eastern Washington]], sweeping its topsoil down the [[Columbia River Gorge]]. When floodwaters met log- and ice-jams at [[Kalama, Washington|Kalama]] in southwest Washington, the water caused a backup that filled the entire Willamette Valley to a depth of {{convert|300|to|400|ft|m}} above current sea level.<ref name=Cataclysms>''Cataclysms on the Columbia'', by John Elliott Allen and Marjorie Burns with Sam C.

The lake gradually drained away, leaving layered sedimentary soils on the valley floor to a height of about {{convert|180|to|200|ft|m}} above current sea level throughout the [[Tualatin Valley|Tualatin]], [[Yamhill River|Yamhill]] and Willamette valleys.<ref name=Oregon/>\n\nGeologists have come to refer to the resulting lake as [[Lake Allison]], named for [[Oregon State University]] geologist [[Ira S. Allison]], who first described Willamette Silt soil in 1953 and noted its similarity to soils on the floor of former [[Lake Lewis]] in Eastern Washington. Allison is also known for his work in the 1930s documenting the hundreds of non-native boulders (called [[Glacial erratic|erratics]]) washed down by the floods, rafted on [[iceberg]]s and deposited on the valley bottom and in a ring around the lower hills surrounding the Willamette Valley. One of the most prominent of these is the [[Erratic Rock State Natural Site|Bellevue Erratic]], just off [[Oregon Route 18]] west of McMinnville.<ref name=Cataclysms/>\n\nIt is also believed that the [[Willamette Meteorite]] was rafted by flood and ice to the location near [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]] where it was found in 1902.\n\n==Geography==\nThe valley may be loosely defined as the broad plain of the Willamette, bounded on the west by the Oregon Coast Range and on the east by the Cascade Range. It is bounded on the south by the Calapooya Mountains, which separate the headwaters of the Willamette from the [[Umpqua River]] valley about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} south of [[Hidden Valley, Oregon|Hidden Valley]].  [[Interstate 5]] runs the length of the valley, linking its major communities.\n\nBecause of differing cultural and political interests, the [[Portland metropolitan area]] and [[Tualatin Valley|Tualatin River valley]] are often not included in the local use of the term.  Additionally, the east slopes of the Coast Ranges and the west slopes of the Cascade Range from [[Oakridge, Oregon|Oakridge]] to [[Detroit Lake]] can be considered part of the Willamette Valley in a cultural sense, despite being mountainous areas.\n\nCities in the valley include, from south to north, [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]], Eugene, Corvallis, [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], [[Dallas, Oregon|Dallas]], Salem, Keizer, McMinnville, and [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. Parts of the following counties, from south to north, lie within the valley: [[Douglas County, Oregon|Douglas]], [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane]], [[Linn County, Oregon|Linn]], [[Benton County, Oregon|Benton]], [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]], [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion]], [[Yamhill County, Oregon|Yamhill]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]]. Sometimes the area around Albany and Corvallis and surrounding Benton and Linn counties is referred to locally as the Mid-Valley.<ref name=MVOnline>{{cite news |url= http://www.mvourtown.com/ |title= Mid-Valley Our Town |newspaper= [[Albany Democrat-Herald]] |accessdate= September 4, 2008}}</ref> Marion, Polk, and other counties are sometimes included in the definition of the Mid-Valley.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Willamette Valley fog.JPG|left|thumb|240px|alt=Fog in valley|Light fog in the southern valley]]\nThe climate of the Willamette Valley is a temperate oceanic '''climate''' (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfb''), which features cool summers, and wet winters with frequent overcast and cloudy skies. \n\nTemperatures are predictable throughout the year, with daytime highs frequently reaching the low to mid 80s in the summer and the mid 40s in the winter. Lengthy stretches of {{convert|90|F|C}} days occur every summer, occasionally reaching {{convert|100|F|C}}. Very cold days where the daytime high fails to rise above freezing are rare and may occur only two or three days per year, and occasionally not at all, especially in the lowest elevations of the valley. Temperatures of {{convert|5|F|C}} or lower occur only about once every 25 years. Spring and fall days are consistently between 50 and 70 degrees, with occasional surges of summer-like or winter-like temperatures that rarely last more than a week.<ref name = \"climatologist\"/>\n\nPrecipitation varies considerably across the valley and is closely correlated with elevation. Annual totals range from {{convert|36|in|mm}} at the lowest elevations to more than {{convert|80|in|mm}} in the foothills.

Notable floods include the [[Great Flood of 1862]], events in 1899, the [[Christmas flood of 1964]], and the [[Willamette Valley Flood of 1996]].  Part of its [[floodplain]] is a [[National Natural Landmark]] called the [[Willamette Floodplain]].\n\nHistorically, the Willamette Valley forests were mostly an [[oak savanna]]\u2014tall grasslands with scattered [[Garry oak]]s and groves of [[coast Douglas-fir]]. The river floodplains contained extensive wetlands, stands of willow, alder, and cottonwood, and gallery forests. This landscape was maintained by the Native American inhabitants of the valley who set frequent fires that encouraged the open grasslands and killed young trees. The American settlers of the region, since the 19th&nbsp;century, suppressed fires and converted much of the valley to agriculture, which has caused much of the former grassland and savanna to revert to closed-canopy forest.  Less than one-tenth of one percent of the original savanna vegetation remains. The remaining enclaves include a section of Garry oak savanna preserved at [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]] in Eugene.

Huxley's principal contribution was to establish protoplasm as incompatible with a [[vitalism|vitalistic theory of life]].<ref name=\"Geison1969\">{{citation | author = Geison, Gerald| year = 1969 | title = The Protoplasmic Theory of Life and the Vitalist-Mechanist Debate| journal = Isis | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 272\u2013292 | doi=10.1086/350498| pmid = 4919832 }}</ref> Attempts to investigate the [[origin of life]] through the creation of synthetic \"protoplasm\" in the laboratory were not successful.<ref name=\"Lazcano2008\">{{citation |author1=Lazcano, A. |author2=Capone, S. |author3=Walde, P. |author4=Seebach, D. |author5=Ishikawa, T. |author6=Caputo, R. | year = 2008 | title = What Is Life?
