In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success.

In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit.

Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise.

It also spawned the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 4.</ref> During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by [[The Band]] and their 1968 album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', saying: \"What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity \u2013 or ''pseudo''-virtuosity \u2013 thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William |last=McKeen |title=Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology |publisher=W.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show. Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/>\n\n====Personal problems and early solo success====\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&pg=PA67&dq=eric+clapton+DRUGS+1970s&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton] p.67. Omnibus Press, 1995</ref> Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up. He nursed a [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison's [[Concert for Bangladesh]] benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> In January 1973, [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], titled the \"[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]\", to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton returned the favour by playing \"The Preacher\" in [[Tommy (1975 film)|Ken Russell's film version]] of the Who's ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in 1975. His appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set.<ref name=\"nxfddy\"/>\n\n[[File:Clapton and Elliman.jpg|thumb|[[Yvonne Elliman]] with Clapton promoting ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' in 1974]]\nIn 1974, Clapton started living with Boyd (they would not marry until 1979) and was no longer using heroin (although he gradually began to drink heavily).

With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of \"[[I Shot the Sheriff]]\" was Clapton's first number one hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP ''[[E. C. Was Here]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Pete Prown|author2=Harvey P.

Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets \u2013 reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at London's [[Drury Lane theatre]] heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade.

On the flight over, Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks, for fear he would never be able to drink again.

A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, he produced what he thought as his \"most forced\" album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''.

In 2006 they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of \"[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\". Clapton, now a regular charity performer, played at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F.

The album's first track, the hit \"It's in the Way That You Use It\", appeared in the [[Tom Cruise]]\u2013[[Paul Newman]] film ''[[The Color of Money]]''. The horn-driven \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"[[Sussudio]]\" and other work, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound.

In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that \"For Your Love\" went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member.

In June, Clapton was invited to jam with [[Jimmy Page]], recording a number of tracks that would be retroactively credited to [[All-Stars (band)|The Immediate All-Stars]]. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit.

Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref> Clapton has also credited [[Music From Big Pink]], the debut album of [[The Band]], and its revolutionary [[Americana]] sound as influencing his decision to leave Cream.<ref>Runtagh, J.

Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show.

The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders.

Shyam has meditated, studied and been dedicated to this tradition since his early childhood, when his father invited Swami [[Ramanand]], a guru from Uttar Pradesh, to live in their home. Swami Ramanand initiated the young Shyam in meditation, and the family home became a meeting place for satsang (the company of true knowledge) for those who lived in the region. Ramanand taught the [[Vedas]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] and other scriptures, as well as meditation. In 1973 Shyam moved to [[Kullu]], Valley of Gods, [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.\n\nMeditation and knowledge of the self are the essence of Shyam's teachings. He has meditated, studied and taught meditation throughout his life, and established organisations for the continuation of this work, such as the [[International Meditation Institute]] (IMI), which he founded in 1976 in Kullu; [[Shanti-Sneh Abhiyan]], which he formed in 1986 in Kullu; and the [[Man-Friend Association]], which he founded in the early 1960s in [[Chandigarh]], India. In 1986, at the ''First International Yog Conference'' in New Delhi, Shyam was awarded the ''Yog Shiromani Award'' by the President of India, [[Giani Zail Singh]], for his work in the field of meditation and self-realization and the 1974 ''Integrity Award'' presented by [[Geoff Stirling]] on behalf of [[Apache Communications]] in [[Gander, Newfoundland]]. Shyam has spoken by invitation to thousands of people throughout India and in Europe, North America and South America, at international conferences, organisations, universities and schools, as well as on television and radio.\n\nThe published works of Shyam include original works in English and Hindi, as well as translations with commentaries of ancient Sanskrit texts, published by the International Meditation Institute. (See below for a list of titles.) Some of these books have been translated into French, German, Hebrew, Punjabi, Norwegian and other languages. He wrote every day, sometimes several times, culminating in thousands of writings based on his own practice and inner research.\n\nIn addition to prose, Shyam had seven published volumes of poetry; he has written over 10,000 poems. His poetry speaks of the knowledge of the universal Self, meditation and the sense of love and devotion. It is written in classical meters, which are traditionally sung. Lauded twentieth- and twenty-first-century Hindi poets [[Mahadevi Varma]] and [[Gopaldas Neeraj]], as well as scholars of Hindi literature, [[Laxmi Narayan]] and [[Ganpati Chandra Gupta]], have written introductions to his published volumes of poetry. Academic theses have been written on his philosophy and his creative works (see selection listed below).\n\nThe basis of Shyam's teachings is meditation. The core of his teachings is the vision of oneness, the knowledge of I, you, or self, which he says is \"pure, free, forever, birthless and deathless.\" This knowledge, he says, is unfolded through the practice of meditation, study and the application of that knowledge in a person's waking state. His mantra, \"Amaram Hum Madhuram Hum\", means, \"I am eternal, I am blissful.\" It encapsulates the essence of Shyam's philosophy and teachings.\n\n== Books about Shyam ==\nBelow is a selection of published books and PhD dissertations on the poetry, philosophy and life of Shyam:\n\n'''(A) In Hindi:'''<br />\n\u2022 Shyam Sandesh: Swami Shyam ke Sakshatkar (Swami Shyam: Direct Experience) by Vishwaprakash Dixit \"Batuk\"<br />\n\u2022 Hindi Bhakti Yog Kavya Parampara aur Shyam Kavya (The Tradition of Hindi Bhakti Yog Poets and the Poet, Swami Shyam) by Rameshwar Prasad Dvivedi<br />\n\u2022 Swami Shyam: Vishwa-Sant tatha Guru Shreshth (Swami Shyam: Universal Saint and Guru Consciousness) by Anita Naiyyar (Shanti Prakashan, Rohtak, India, 2008.)<br />\n\u2022 Sant Surabhi by Sita Sharma, (Jalandhar, India) <br />\n\u2022 Sadhana ke Swar (The Voice of Sadhana) by Suman Mishra.

His mantra, \"Amaram Hum Madhuram Hum\", means, \"I am eternal, I am blissful.\" It encapsulates the essence of Shyam's philosophy and teachings.\n\n== Books about Shyam ==\nBelow is a selection of published books and PhD dissertations on the poetry, philosophy and life of Shyam:\n\n'''(A) In Hindi:'''<br />\n\u2022 Shyam Sandesh: Swami Shyam ke Sakshatkar (Swami Shyam: Direct Experience) by Vishwaprakash Dixit \"Batuk\"<br />\n\u2022 Hindi Bhakti Yog Kavya Parampara aur Shyam Kavya (The Tradition of Hindi Bhakti Yog Poets and the Poet, Swami Shyam) by Rameshwar Prasad Dvivedi<br />\n\u2022 Swami Shyam: Vishwa-Sant tatha Guru Shreshth (Swami Shyam: Universal Saint and Guru Consciousness) by Anita Naiyyar (Shanti Prakashan, Rohtak, India, 2008.)<br />\n\u2022 Sant Surabhi by Sita Sharma, (Jalandhar, India) <br />\n\u2022 Sadhana ke Swar (The Voice of Sadhana) by Suman Mishra.

He had his early education at [[Neyyattinkara]] English Medium School and ''Rajagiyamahapadashala, the ''Royal school, [[Thiruvananthapuram]].  He was a shy and silent student. Kattupana Naganathaiyer, K. VeluPilla and R. Keshavapilla were his early teachers. Ramakrishna Pillai utilized his less restricted life in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] to acquaint himself with new books, newspapers, new places and new friends.  He passed his matriculation exam at the age of 14.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\n==Journalism==\nWhile studying for F.A, Ramakrishna started taking a keen interest in newspapers and journalism. An avid reader, he read almost every newspaper published from Travancore, [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] States. During the time, he also gained the friendship and guidance of many literary legends and editors like [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran]], Adithya Das ,A R Rajaraja Varma, [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]], Pettayil Raman Pillai Asshan, Oduvil Kunji Krishna Menon and Kandathil Varghese Mappillai. This inspired him to write articles for news papers. His excessive passion for writing and newspapers, earned the wrath of his uncle and family. He passed in the F.A. exam in 1898 and wanted to go to [[Madras]] for his  BSc degree. However, on the directives of his uncle, he joined for BA degree course at [[University College, Trivandrum]].<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\nRamakrishna Pillai and other newspaper-enthusiasts had felt the need of a Malayalam newspaper. ''Kerala Darpanum'' and ''Vanjivibhujhika'' were already being published since 1900. Though his friends and well wishers persuaded him to take up the editorship of ''Kerala Darpanum'', it was difficult to manage studies and the editorship of a newspaper. Due to the resistance of his uncle Keshava Pillai, Ramakrishna had to leave home to take up a job.<ref>{{cite book|first=Siba Pada |last=Sen|title=Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Institute of Historical Studies|year=1972|pages=379}}</ref>  He passed the B.A. (Malayalam ) Degree with first rank and received the ''Keralvarmamudhra'', an honorary award for academic excellence.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\nRamakrishna Pillai began writing strongly against age-old malpractices and ill-customs of those days. he believed in action than words.  He challenged customary practices by marrying ''Nanikutti Amma '', ''Thoopuveetil'', Palkulangara, Thiruvananthapuram,  a woman from lower sub-caste of the [[Nair]] community in 1901. A relative of Nanikutti Amma, ''Shri Prameshvaran Pillai'', was the owner of ''Kerala Darappanum''.  Later, however, Ramakrishna Pillai and Prameshvaran Pillai got into litigation.\n\nIn 1901, ''Kerala Darappanum'' and ''Vanjivibhujhika'' merged to form ''Keralapanjhika''. ''Keralapanjhika'' was owned by Marthanada Thampi. Ramakrishna Pillai was editor of the newspaper from 1901 to 1903. During this time, he traveled around the state of Travancore to gather first hand account of the people of Travancore and their problems. In February 1903, he resigned from ''Keralapangika''. He, however, continued to write articles in ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Nasranideepika]]'' and ''Malayali'' newspapers. In 1904 he moved to [[Kollam]] with his family to work as the editor of ''Malayali''. He wrote editorials on the rights and duties of the people of Travancore. He also spoke at conferences held in [[Cherthala]] and [[Paravur Taluk|Paravur]] [[Taluk]]s about the ills and malpractices rampant in the society.\n\nIn 1904, his wife Nanikutti Amma died. During the period, literary discourses and letters brought Ramakrishna Pillai close to ''B. Kalyani Amma''. Later they were married.\n\n==Swadeshabhimani==\n[[Vakkom Moulavi|Abdul Khader Moulavi]], popularly known as ''[[Vakkom Moulavi]]'', was the owner of the journal called ''Swadeshabhimani'' and C P Govinda Pillai, the editor. RamaKrishna Pillai took over as the editor of the journal in January 1906. Ramakrishna Pillai and his family thus shifted to [[Vakkom]] in [[Chirayinkil (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chirayinkil]] Taluk, where the office of the newspaper and the printing press were located. In July 1907, the office of Swadeshabhimani was moved to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and the family moved to Thiruvananthapuram. Though Vakkom Moulavi continued to own the paper, he had given Ramakrishna Pillai total freedom to run the newspaper. They never had any legal or financial contracts between them. Yet, Moulavi provided all the financial aid to set up the press in Thiruvananthapuram.\nRamakrisha Pillai also started a woman's magazine called ''Sharadha'', a student's magazine called '' Vidhyarthi'' and another magazine named ''Keralan''.\n\nP. Rajagopalachari, the then Diwan of Travancore, was the centre of attacks of the newspaper. The paper accused the Dewan of immorality and corruption. But \"the most serious thing against the Swadeshabhimani,\" wrote the Dewan, \"has always been the remarkable persistence with which it preached the gospel of government by the people, and the exhortation which it held out to the people of Travancore to unite and demand self-government.\".<ref name=\"Jeffrey\">{{cite web|url=http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/ASAA/biennial-conference/2004/Jeffrey-R-ASAA2004.pdf|title=THE THREE STAGES OF PRINT : Testing Ideas of \"Public Sphere,\" \"Print-Capitalism\" and \"Public Action\"|first=Robin |last=Jeffrey|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Diwan P. |last=Rajagopalachari|year=1912|title=Dewan's Note dated 15 August 1912, on the Suppression of the Swadeshabhimani Newspaper|publisher=Trivandrum: Government Press|pages=4}}</ref> He also attacked the kingship of the Maharaja of Travancore:\n<blockquote> \" ''The monarchs believe and force others to believe that they are God's representatives or incarnations.

Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to [[Thirunelveli]] in [[Madras Province]] of [[British India]]. The Superintendent of Police, F S S George (a British Officer), Inspector R Achuthen Pillai, Inspector B Govinda Pillai and Inspector Pichu Aiyangar, carried out the arrest, without an arrest warrant. The police escorted him till [[Thirunelveli]]. The Kingdom of Travancore itself was a princely state under the Madras Presidency, then. Ramakrishna Pillai's family joined him later once he moved to a rented house in [[Madras]]. Editorships of newspapers like [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] and [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] came to be offered to him during the time, but he chose to stay in [[Madras]].\n\nMany nationalists and [[British India|Indian]] newspapers reacted to the arrest and banishment of Ramakrishna Pillai and the banning of the paper. However, countering the king and the British Government that overruled the king, was not easy. Yet, early in the first half of the twenties, the banned newspaper was revived  by the mighty will of [[K. Kumar|K. Kumar of Travancore]], the veteran Gandhian and Freedom Fighter.  He viewed the revival as a befitting tribute to Ramakrishna Pillai.   Kumar himself was its manager and chief-editor. He was assisted in his efforts by K. Narayana Kurukkal, a close colleague of Ramakrishna Pillai and the author of the novels: \"Parappuram\" and \"Udayabhanu\" besides Barrister A K Pillai. Ramakrishna Pillai's wife, B. Kalyani Amma, Pillai's associates K. Narayana Kurukkal, R. Narayana Panikker and the famous political-journalist Raman Menon and K. Kumar himself were regular contributors to the magazine.  The paper was revived under the same name 'Swadeshabhimani' and had its headquarters in the  building currently housing the DPI Office at Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. In spite of all these, the government wisely chose to remain silent. The new 'Swadeshabhimani' was re-modeled after \"Modern Review\" of Ramand Chatterjee. It continued its legacy as a significant force transforming the socio-political life of Kerala. [[K. Kumar]] had great admiration for Ramakrishna Pillai and he took the lead role in organizing the deportation-day of Pillai as \"Ramakrishna Pillai Day\" (from M.E: 10-02-1098) and erecting his statue in Trivandrum. Ramakrishna Pillai Day continued to be commemorated in Trivandrum for a long time thereafter.<ref>The Audacious Nationalist (K.C. Pillai)- K. Kumarji Smaraka Grantham - 1974</ref> It appears that the editorship of Swadeshabhimani passed on to A.K Pillai (by 1932) who also edited the \"Swarat\" with the help and support of [[K. Kumar]].\n\nNOTE: After Independence, the Government of Kerala returned the press of Swadeshabhimani to Vakkom Moulavi's family in 1957.\n[[File:\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d26\u0d47\u0d36\u0d3e\u0d2d\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d30\u0d3e\u0d2e\u0d15\u0d43\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d23\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d33\u0d4d\u0d33\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d38\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d15 \u0d38\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d02.JPG|thumbnail|Ramakrishna Pillai Samadhi at Kannur]]\n\n==Last years==\nWhile in exile, Ramakrishna Pillai returned to his studies. He joined the F.L. Degree and Kalyaniamma joined BA Degree program in Philosophy. It was during these days in Madras that he wrote the book ''Ende Naadukadathal'' ({{ISBN|81-264-1222-4}} ) on his banishment from Travancore. After a brief vacation in [[Palghat]], the family returned to Madras. Pillai had to attend to studies as well as court proceedings in the ''Indian Patriot'' Case. In April, the couple left [[Madras]].  Their third child, a daughter, was born following this on 7 August 1912.\n\nIn the same year, Ramakrishna Pillai published ''Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam'', a book on Journalism which became very popular later. His biographies of Karl Marx and [[Benjamin Franklin]] were also published. There are scores of articles and literary creations to his credit. In May 1913, the family went to [[Palghat]] after which Ramakrishna Pillai published his books ''Mannante Kannathum '' and ''Narakathil Ninnu''. When Kaliyaniamma found a job as a teacher in [[Kannur]], they moved Kannur. His physical health began to deteriorate during this period.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" /><ref>[http://www.keralasahityaakademi.org/sp/Writers/PROFILES/Swadeshabhimani/Html/Swadeshabhimanigraphy.htm Ramakrishna Pillai]</ref>\n\nA prolific writer and fearless campaigner of civil rights, Swadeshabhimani K Ramakrishna Pillai succumbed to his ille-health on 28 March 1916. He will be remembered as the bitterest enemy of the scheduled castes and tribes in Kerala.

He had his early education at [[Neyyattinkara]] English Medium School and ''Rajagiyamahapadashala, the ''Royal school, [[Thiruvananthapuram]].  He was a shy and silent student. Kattupana Naganathaiyer, K. VeluPilla and R. Keshavapilla were his early teachers. Ramakrishna Pillai utilized his less restricted life in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] to acquaint himself with new books, newspapers, new places and new friends.  He passed his matriculation exam at the age of 14.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\n==Journalism==\nWhile studying for F.A, Ramakrishna started taking a keen interest in newspapers and journalism. An avid reader, he read almost every newspaper published from Travancore, [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] States. During the time, he also gained the friendship and guidance of many literary legends and editors like [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran]], Adithya Das ,A R Rajaraja Varma, [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]], Pettayil Raman Pillai Asshan, Oduvil Kunji Krishna Menon and Kandathil Varghese Mappillai. This inspired him to write articles for news papers. His excessive passion for writing and newspapers, earned the wrath of his uncle and family. He passed in the F.A. exam in 1898 and wanted to go to [[Madras]] for his  BSc degree. However, on the directives of his uncle, he joined for BA degree course at [[University College, Trivandrum]].<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\nRamakrishna Pillai and other newspaper-enthusiasts had felt the need of a Malayalam newspaper. ''Kerala Darpanum'' and ''Vanjivibhujhika'' were already being published since 1900. Though his friends and well wishers persuaded him to take up the editorship of ''Kerala Darpanum'', it was difficult to manage studies and the editorship of a newspaper. Due to the resistance of his uncle Keshava Pillai, Ramakrishna had to leave home to take up a job.<ref>{{cite book|first=Siba Pada |last=Sen|title=Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Institute of Historical Studies|year=1972|pages=379}}</ref>  He passed the B.A. (Malayalam ) Degree with first rank and received the ''Keralvarmamudhra'', an honorary award for academic excellence.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" />\n\nRamakrishna Pillai began writing strongly against age-old malpractices and ill-customs of those days. he believed in action than words.  He challenged customary practices by marrying ''Nanikutti Amma '', ''Thoopuveetil'', Palkulangara, Thiruvananthapuram,  a woman from lower sub-caste of the [[Nair]] community in 1901. A relative of Nanikutti Amma, ''Shri Prameshvaran Pillai'', was the owner of ''Kerala Darappanum''.  Later, however, Ramakrishna Pillai and Prameshvaran Pillai got into litigation.\n\nIn 1901, ''Kerala Darappanum'' and ''Vanjivibhujhika'' merged to form ''Keralapanjhika''. ''Keralapanjhika'' was owned by Marthanada Thampi. Ramakrishna Pillai was editor of the newspaper from 1901 to 1903. During this time, he traveled around the state of Travancore to gather first hand account of the people of Travancore and their problems. In February 1903, he resigned from ''Keralapangika''. He, however, continued to write articles in ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Nasranideepika]]'' and ''Malayali'' newspapers. In 1904 he moved to [[Kollam]] with his family to work as the editor of ''Malayali''. He wrote editorials on the rights and duties of the people of Travancore. He also spoke at conferences held in [[Cherthala]] and [[Paravur Taluk|Paravur]] [[Taluk]]s about the ills and malpractices rampant in the society.\n\nIn 1904, his wife Nanikutti Amma died. During the period, literary discourses and letters brought Ramakrishna Pillai close to ''B. Kalyani Amma''. Later they were married.\n\n==Swadeshabhimani==\n[[Vakkom Moulavi|Abdul Khader Moulavi]], popularly known as ''[[Vakkom Moulavi]]'', was the owner of the journal called ''Swadeshabhimani'' and C P Govinda Pillai, the editor. RamaKrishna Pillai took over as the editor of the journal in January 1906. Ramakrishna Pillai and his family thus shifted to [[Vakkom]] in [[Chirayinkil (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chirayinkil]] Taluk, where the office of the newspaper and the printing press were located. In July 1907, the office of Swadeshabhimani was moved to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and the family moved to Thiruvananthapuram. Though Vakkom Moulavi continued to own the paper, he had given Ramakrishna Pillai total freedom to run the newspaper. They never had any legal or financial contracts between them. Yet, Moulavi provided all the financial aid to set up the press in Thiruvananthapuram.\nRamakrisha Pillai also started a woman's magazine called ''Sharadha'', a student's magazine called '' Vidhyarthi'' and another magazine named ''Keralan''.\n\nP. Rajagopalachari, the then Diwan of Travancore, was the centre of attacks of the newspaper. The paper accused the Dewan of immorality and corruption. But \"the most serious thing against the Swadeshabhimani,\" wrote the Dewan, \"has always been the remarkable persistence with which it preached the gospel of government by the people, and the exhortation which it held out to the people of Travancore to unite and demand self-government.\".<ref name=\"Jeffrey\">{{cite web|url=http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/ASAA/biennial-conference/2004/Jeffrey-R-ASAA2004.pdf|title=THE THREE STAGES OF PRINT : Testing Ideas of \"Public Sphere,\" \"Print-Capitalism\" and \"Public Action\"|first=Robin |last=Jeffrey|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Diwan P. |last=Rajagopalachari|year=1912|title=Dewan's Note dated 15 August 1912, on the Suppression of the Swadeshabhimani Newspaper|publisher=Trivandrum: Government Press|pages=4}}</ref> He also attacked the kingship of the Maharaja of Travancore:\n<blockquote> \" ''The monarchs believe and force others to believe that they are God's representatives or incarnations. This is absurd. Did God create a special kind of dog to be the king of dogs, or a special kind of elephant to rule over all elephants? ''\"</blockquote>\nSwadeshabhimani's pen moved against corruption in the state and injustice in the society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/27/stories/2005092708630400.htm|title= Remembering Swadeshabhimani|date=27 September 2005|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref> He irritated the Maharajah [[Moolam Thirunal]] himself by criticizing the large expenses incurred by the Royal consort, the [[Panapillai Amma]], by constructing private palaces and publicly celebrating the wedding of the daughter of the Maharajah.\n\nOn 26 September 1910, ''Swadeshabhimani'' newspaper and the printing press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police. Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to [[Thirunelveli]] in [[Madras Province]] of [[British India]]. The Superintendent of Police, F S S George (a British Officer), Inspector R Achuthen Pillai, Inspector B Govinda Pillai and Inspector Pichu Aiyangar, carried out the arrest, without an arrest warrant. The police escorted him till [[Thirunelveli]]. The Kingdom of Travancore itself was a princely state under the Madras Presidency, then. Ramakrishna Pillai's family joined him later once he moved to a rented house in [[Madras]]. Editorships of newspapers like [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] and [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] came to be offered to him during the time, but he chose to stay in [[Madras]].\n\nMany nationalists and [[British India|Indian]] newspapers reacted to the arrest and banishment of Ramakrishna Pillai and the banning of the paper. However, countering the king and the British Government that overruled the king, was not easy. Yet, early in the first half of the twenties, the banned newspaper was revived  by the mighty will of [[K. Kumar|K. Kumar of Travancore]], the veteran Gandhian and Freedom Fighter.  He viewed the revival as a befitting tribute to Ramakrishna Pillai.   Kumar himself was its manager and chief-editor. He was assisted in his efforts by K. Narayana Kurukkal, a close colleague of Ramakrishna Pillai and the author of the novels: \"Parappuram\" and \"Udayabhanu\" besides Barrister A K Pillai. Ramakrishna Pillai's wife, B. Kalyani Amma, Pillai's associates K. Narayana Kurukkal, R. Narayana Panikker and the famous political-journalist Raman Menon and K. Kumar himself were regular contributors to the magazine.  The paper was revived under the same name 'Swadeshabhimani' and had its headquarters in the  building currently housing the DPI Office at Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. In spite of all these, the government wisely chose to remain silent. The new 'Swadeshabhimani' was re-modeled after \"Modern Review\" of Ramand Chatterjee. It continued its legacy as a significant force transforming the socio-political life of Kerala. [[K. Kumar]] had great admiration for Ramakrishna Pillai and he took the lead role in organizing the deportation-day of Pillai as \"Ramakrishna Pillai Day\" (from M.E: 10-02-1098) and erecting his statue in Trivandrum. Ramakrishna Pillai Day continued to be commemorated in Trivandrum for a long time thereafter.<ref>The Audacious Nationalist (K.C. Pillai)- K. Kumarji Smaraka Grantham - 1974</ref> It appears that the editorship of Swadeshabhimani passed on to A.K Pillai (by 1932) who also edited the \"Swarat\" with the help and support of [[K. Kumar]].\n\nNOTE: After Independence, the Government of Kerala returned the press of Swadeshabhimani to Vakkom Moulavi's family in 1957.\n[[File:\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d26\u0d47\u0d36\u0d3e\u0d2d\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d30\u0d3e\u0d2e\u0d15\u0d43\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d23\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d33\u0d4d\u0d33\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d38\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d15 \u0d38\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d02.JPG|thumbnail|Ramakrishna Pillai Samadhi at Kannur]]\n\n==Last years==\nWhile in exile, Ramakrishna Pillai returned to his studies. He joined the F.L. Degree and Kalyaniamma joined BA Degree program in Philosophy. It was during these days in Madras that he wrote the book ''Ende Naadukadathal'' ({{ISBN|81-264-1222-4}} ) on his banishment from Travancore. After a brief vacation in [[Palghat]], the family returned to Madras. Pillai had to attend to studies as well as court proceedings in the ''Indian Patriot'' Case. In April, the couple left [[Madras]].  Their third child, a daughter, was born following this on 7 August 1912.\n\nIn the same year, Ramakrishna Pillai published ''Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam'', a book on Journalism which became very popular later. His biographies of Karl Marx and [[Benjamin Franklin]] were also published. There are scores of articles and literary creations to his credit. In May 1913, the family went to [[Palghat]] after which Ramakrishna Pillai published his books ''Mannante Kannathum '' and ''Narakathil Ninnu''. When Kaliyaniamma found a job as a teacher in [[Kannur]], they moved Kannur. His physical health began to deteriorate during this period.<ref name=\"VyazhavattaSmaranakal\" /><ref>[http://www.keralasahityaakademi.org/sp/Writers/PROFILES/Swadeshabhimani/Html/Swadeshabhimanigraphy.htm Ramakrishna Pillai]</ref>\n\nA prolific writer and fearless campaigner of civil rights, Swadeshabhimani K Ramakrishna Pillai succumbed to his ille-health on 28 March 1916. He will be remembered as the bitterest enemy of the scheduled castes and tribes in Kerala.

The series started as a short-run (13 episodes) [[mid-season replacement]] on March 10, 1998, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The series ran for four seasons, ending with a planned series finale, its eighty-first episode, on May 16, 2001.\n\nThe series starred [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Richard Ruccolo]], and [[Traylor Howard]] as the title characters. The second season saw the arrival of two additional recurring characters, Johnny Donnelly ([[Nathan Fillion]]) and Ashley Walker ([[Suzanne Cryer]]). In 2000, for the fourth season, ABC bounced the sitcom from midweek to a [[Friday night death slot]], leading to a steep drop in [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. After the show moved back to Wednesday for a two-week trial in an unsuccessful attempt to regain ratings, it was cancelled in May 2001. The series finale was titled \"The Internet Show\", an episode in which fans of the show voted on the characters\u2019 outcome online.\n\n==Overview==\nFocusing on the lives of twenty-somethings Michael Bergen, Pete Dunville, and Sharon Carter, the show was originally based on the life of its creator. The fictional \"Beacon Street Pizza\" was based on a real pizza restaurant named Theo's Pizza in [[Teele Square]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], where show creator Kenny Schwartz worked while attending nearby [[Tufts University]]. The show is set in [[Boston]], but was filmed at [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]].\n\nThe series stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Michael Leslie \"Berg\" Bergen, [[Richard Ruccolo]] as Peter \"Pete\" Dunville, and [[Traylor Howard]] as campus beauty Sharon Carter (later Carter-Donnelly). In the first two seasons, Berg, a [[slacker]], works at a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] pizza parlor, [[Beacon Street]] Pizza, with Pete. They both attend [[Tufts University]], with Sharon, who after graduation, works as the spokesperson (or apologist) for Immaculate Chemicals.\n\nThe format of the initial season varied considerably from subsequent seasons. The first season features [[Jennifer Westfeldt]] as Melissa, Pete's girlfriend, and [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Mr. Bauer, a delusional old man who frequents the pizza place, pretending that experiences from films are his own. The second season abandons these two characters, focusing on the interplay between Pete and Berg and their relationship with Sharon, who lives in the apartment above them. Berg eventually decides to attend [[medical school]] and become a [[Physician|doctor]], while Pete drops out of [[architecture]] classes to become a career counselor. The second season also introduces Johnny Donnelly ([[Nathan Fillion]]), a jukebox repairman who starts dating Sharon, and Ashley Walker ([[Suzanne Cryer]]), a medical school classmate of Berg's who competes with him to be top of the class.\n\nAt the start of season three, the pizza place is abandoned entirely (hence the change in the show's title), and Berg begins his [[medical residency]]. Pete becomes a vice president of a cosmetics company, and then a [[firefighter]]. Johnny and Sharon marry and become the superintendents of their apartment building. Berg goes on to date Irene (Jillian Bach), the eccentric neighbor across the hall, and Pete begins dating a fellow firefighter named Marti ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Two Guys and a Girl episodes}}\n{{:List of Two Guys and a Girl episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Michael Eugene Leslie \"Berg\" Bergen \u2013 the mischievous [[everyman]] with boyish looks who often creates chaos in the lives of his friends, particularly Pete.

Later, near the end of the show, he begins a lust-based relationship with Berg's ex-girlfriend, Ashley.\n* [[Traylor Howard]] as Sharon Carter-Donnelly \u2013 a complex woman who is good friends with Pete and Berg.

Eventually, Sharon and Johnny decide they are ready for children, as seen in the series finale.\n* [[Suzanne Cryer]] as Ashley Walker (1999\u20132001) \u2013 arrives in the second season and meets Berg at medical school.

Despite his small height, he behaves as if he were tall and muscular, frequently challenging the much more physically intimidating Berg to fights. In the finale, it is revealed that this sense of self-righteousness comes from his status as an army reservist who is trained to snap a man's neck with one hand.\n\n===Notable guest cast===\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Isabella (1998) \u2013 a love interest of Pete's who gets between him and Berg.

The episode entitled \"[[The Pilot (Two Guys and a Girl)|The Pilot]]\" was watched by almost 18 million viewers.\n\nThe story of season 1 centers around the pizza place. Actors such as [[Jennifer Westfeldt]] (Melissa), and [[Julius Carry]] (Bill) were credited as secondary cast members to principals [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Richard Ruccolo]], and [[Traylor Howard]]. Mr. Bauer, played by [[David Ogden Stiers]], frequently appeared around the pizza place, telling stories of life events which actually occurred in movies. Pete and Berg share an apartment, on which Peter pays the rent every month, with Berg testing experimental drugs to supplement their income. Pete structures his life around architecture and grad school, while Sharon, their friend upstairs, works for an [[evil corporation]] that exploits the Earth's natural resources, much to her dislike.\n\nThe episodes contained storylines including: Pete preparing for a presentation which Berg ruins; Berg stealing the Celtics' '81 championship banner; Sharon joining the softball team; and the story of how they all met. Because the episodes aired out of order, the season seems very disjointed---demonstrated by the status of Pete's relationship with Melissa: in episode 8 \u2013 \"Party\" Melissa and Pete are still together despite having previously broken up in episode 5 \u2013 \"Apartment\". On the DVD release they are episodes 2 and 7.\n\n===Season 2===\nSeason 2 had a more structured basis for each episode. Two additional primary characters arrived, Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer) and Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion), as well as the dismissal of characters Bill, Mr. Bauer, and Pete's long-time girlfriend Melissa.\n\n[[File:Two Guys And A Girl Poster Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cast during Season 2]]\n\nThe season starts with Berg's realization that someone in his class, Walker, is more clever than he is. It leads to an anticipated romance between Berg and Ashley as they both head down the path of becoming physicians. Jukebox repairman Johnny Donnelly begins a relationship with Sharon. Other secondary characters (Irene, Kamen, Shaun) are introduced throughout the season. Episodes of season 2 include: \"Two Guys, a Girl and an Engagement\", \"Two Guys, a Girl and a Valentine's Day\", and \"Two Guys, a Girl and Ashley's Return\", all of which mark turning points in the story of the show. Johnny and Sharon break up on Valentine's Day due to Sharon's jealousy of Shaun, Johnny's best friend. Berg and Ashley finally get together in \"...And Ashley's Return\". Pete confesses his feelings towards Sharon, and Johnny proposes in \"...And an Engagement\". The season ends with Sharon not giving Johnny an answer as well as her realizing she may have feelings for Pete. It left the show with a [[cliffhanger]] after ABC had renewed it for another season.\n\n===Season 3===\nThe pizza place is completely abandoned in the third season so that the characters could pursue different dreams. The premiere resolves the season two cliffhanger, with Sharon answering Johnny's proposal with 'Yes, in theory,' although she is still holding out on her feelings for Pete. Evidently, Pete flew to Paris after the night's events and returns completely over Sharon, with a new girlfriend who speaks only French and is revealed to be extremely racist. Berg and Ashley continue to build on their relationship and finally become doctors involved in psych rotations. The season portrays their relationship as unsteady and completely built on hate of one another. It leads to Berg breaking up with Ashley during the middle of the season.\n\nAshley lives with Pete and Berg before moving into her own apartment, which was originally Sharon's and Johnny's, who move to the basement to become the new supers. She starts dating [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball star [[Nomar Garciaparra]], who appears as himself. Pete finds his true calling by becoming a firefighter. He enjoys the experiences of being an honorary firefighter until the feisty Marti, played by [[Tiffani Thiessen]], comes along to thwart him at every turn. The two continue to take shots at each other until she starts dating Berg, to Pete's dislike. Pete and Berg get into a huge fight concerning Marti and consider not being roommates anymore.\n\nWhen Pete gets his acceptance letter to Fireman Boot Camp, he goes to Marti with open arms and they become an item. Pete continues to hate Berg throughout the final episodes of the season. Sharon and Johnny bicker at one another until Johnny calls off the wedding. When they get back together, they decide that a quickie wedding is the best idea. Irene, Pete's alleged stalker, agrees to throw Sharon and Johnny a wedding on the roof of the building; it results in her inviting [[Robert Goulet]], who conducts the ceremony and brings Pete and Berg back together as friends during the wedding.\n\nAt the end of the two part season finale, Pete and Marti leave to go to Fireman Boot Camp, Sharon and Johnny go on their honeymoon, and Ashley leaves to sort out a joke that Pete told Nomar, causing his and Ashley's break-up. Berg and Irene are left alone at the wedding and start to dance. The series ends with another cliffhanger as the audience is led to believe something will happen between Berg and Irene. The series was renewed for another season due to its 10.2 million average viewers during season 3.\n\n===Season 4===\nIn 2001, ABC moved the sitcom from mid-week to Friday and the show's average viewers dropped from 10.2 to 6.7 million.\n\nSeason 4 continues the story arc from the end of Season 3. Johnny and Sharon are married, Pete and Marti are now firefighters, and Berg and Irene are sleeping together. After Berg gets over being on academic probation, he continues to be Irene's \"sex buddy\". The two start sleeping together secretly, hoping that Pete won't know.\n\nJohnny continues to be the superintendent until Sharon makes him an honorary fireman for the day on his birthday. Johnny decides that he wants to be a fireman, much to Sharon's dislike. Meanwhile, Berg and Irene become a couple and Pete and Marti break up. Marti leaves Pete for Ashley's ex, Nomar. Sharon feels unfulfilled after leaving her evil corporate job and decides that she wants to be a lawyer.\n\nWhen Berg tells Irene that he loves her and she has no reply, Berg goes out and meets someone else. Katie, the girl he meets, admits that she's been following him for 8 years. The two kiss, and Berg tells Irene. Berg apologizes and Irene breaks up with him for the mailman Roger. In the final episode, Berg assumes that Irene may be pregnant and decides that he must win her back.\n\n==Series finale==\nThe series finale is titled \"[[The Internet Show]]\", and was an episode in which fans of the show voted on the outcome online. The episode aired on May 16, 2001. It was written by Donald Beck and Vince Calandra and directed by [[Michael Lembeck]].\n\nIn the episode, Sharon thinks she may be pregnant and Ashley realizes she could be too. Ashley goes into denial, despite showing symptoms, but agrees to take a pregnancy test with Sharon. When Berg finds out from a news report that a glow-in-the-dark condom he used was defective he thinks Irene could be pregnant. Not wanting to worry her, he tries to get a urine sample from her without telling her. Pete is still annoyed at Ashley for giving up on their relationship to go to Stanford.\n\nFour different endings were filmed for viewers to decide which of the central female characters (Sharon, Ashley, or Irene) should become pregnant, while the fourth possible ending had no pregnancies at all. The plan was to have the pregnant one (which ultimately ended up being Ashley) give birth at the end of the proposed fifth season. However, a fifth season of the show never materialized; by the time the fourth-season finale aired in May 2001, the show had been cancelled due to low ratings.\n\n==Ratings==\nThe show had strong ratings success during its run, peaking in season 2 with an average of 12.0 million viewers. The series premiere, titled \"[[The Pilot (Two Guys and a Girl)|The Pilot]]\", was watched by 17.94 million viewers, airing after ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.<ref name=\"Two Guys, A Girl And A Pizza Place Nielsen rating\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/mar15-1998/|title=''Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place'' Nielsen rating March 10th|publisher=mrpopculture.com|accessdate=December 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616091114/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/mar15-1998/|archive-date=June 16, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The episode got a 15.61 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] and won its 18-49 adult demographic.

The title screen is accompanied by an instrumental cover of the song \"[[Blister in the Sun]]\" by the [[Violent Femmes]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe title sequence for Seasons 3 and 4 shows Pete, Berg and Sharon dancing to a more modern piece of music in front of a plain white backdrop, wearing suits and dresses. The newly adapted logo (the show's name having changed) is seen overlaying the footage as the three dance and laugh.\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[Freddy Curci]], Tom Rizzo and Mark Vogel. The music for Seasons 1 and 2 included numerous variations on the title theme, a prime example of which is \"Two Guys, a Girl and a Vacation\" where the cast members do a short rendition of \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]]. Steel drums and Caribbean instruments were used to vary the title theme within the scenes of the episode.\n\n===Crew===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n\n====Directors====\n* [[Amanda Bearse]]\n* [[Robby Benson]]\n* [[Mark Cendrowski]]\n* [[Rich Correll]]\n* Dana DeVally Piazza\n* [[John Fortenberry]]\n* [[Leonard R.

The series started as a short-run (13 episodes) [[mid-season replacement]] on March 10, 1998, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The series ran for four seasons, ending with a planned series finale, its eighty-first episode, on May 16, 2001.\n\nThe series starred [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Richard Ruccolo]], and [[Traylor Howard]] as the title characters. The second season saw the arrival of two additional recurring characters, Johnny Donnelly ([[Nathan Fillion]]) and Ashley Walker ([[Suzanne Cryer]]). In 2000, for the fourth season, ABC bounced the sitcom from midweek to a [[Friday night death slot]], leading to a steep drop in [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. After the show moved back to Wednesday for a two-week trial in an unsuccessful attempt to regain ratings, it was cancelled in May 2001. The series finale was titled \"The Internet Show\", an episode in which fans of the show voted on the characters\u2019 outcome online.\n\n==Overview==\nFocusing on the lives of twenty-somethings Michael Bergen, Pete Dunville, and Sharon Carter, the show was originally based on the life of its creator. The fictional \"Beacon Street Pizza\" was based on a real pizza restaurant named Theo's Pizza in [[Teele Square]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], where show creator Kenny Schwartz worked while attending nearby [[Tufts University]]. The show is set in [[Boston]], but was filmed at [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]].\n\nThe series stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Michael Leslie \"Berg\" Bergen, [[Richard Ruccolo]] as Peter \"Pete\" Dunville, and [[Traylor Howard]] as campus beauty Sharon Carter (later Carter-Donnelly). In the first two seasons, Berg, a [[slacker]], works at a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] pizza parlor, [[Beacon Street]] Pizza, with Pete. They both attend [[Tufts University]], with Sharon, who after graduation, works as the spokesperson (or apologist) for Immaculate Chemicals.\n\nThe format of the initial season varied considerably from subsequent seasons. The first season features [[Jennifer Westfeldt]] as Melissa, Pete's girlfriend, and [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Mr. Bauer, a delusional old man who frequents the pizza place, pretending that experiences from films are his own. The second season abandons these two characters, focusing on the interplay between Pete and Berg and their relationship with Sharon, who lives in the apartment above them. Berg eventually decides to attend [[medical school]] and become a [[Physician|doctor]], while Pete drops out of [[architecture]] classes to become a career counselor. The second season also introduces Johnny Donnelly ([[Nathan Fillion]]), a jukebox repairman who starts dating Sharon, and Ashley Walker ([[Suzanne Cryer]]), a medical school classmate of Berg's who competes with him to be top of the class.\n\nAt the start of season three, the pizza place is abandoned entirely (hence the change in the show's title), and Berg begins his [[medical residency]]. Pete becomes a vice president of a cosmetics company, and then a [[firefighter]]. Johnny and Sharon marry and become the superintendents of their apartment building. Berg goes on to date Irene (Jillian Bach), the eccentric neighbor across the hall, and Pete begins dating a fellow firefighter named Marti ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Two Guys and a Girl episodes}}\n{{:List of Two Guys and a Girl episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Michael Eugene Leslie \"Berg\" Bergen \u2013 the mischievous [[everyman]] with boyish looks who often creates chaos in the lives of his friends, particularly Pete.

Later, near the end of the show, he begins a lust-based relationship with Berg's ex-girlfriend, Ashley.\n* [[Traylor Howard]] as Sharon Carter-Donnelly \u2013 a complex woman who is good friends with Pete and Berg.

The couple marries during the third-season finale. Johnny later decides to become a fireman against Sharon's wishes. Eventually, Sharon and Johnny decide they are ready for children, as seen in the series finale.\n* [[Suzanne Cryer]] as Ashley Walker (1999\u20132001) \u2013 arrives in the second season and meets Berg at medical school. Initially she rejects Berg, hoping to keep her long distance relationship with Justin ([[Jon Cryer]]). She eventually starts dating Berg but he then calls it off. At the end of the fourth season, she starts a sexual relationship with Pete and becomes pregnant in the series finale. Viewers were left unable to know what Ashley would do with the baby due to the show's cancellation.\n* [[Jillian Bach]] as Irene (1999\u20132001) \u2013 arrives mid-season 2 as Pete's stalker.

Despite his small height, he behaves as if he were tall and muscular, frequently challenging the much more physically intimidating Berg to fights. In the finale, it is revealed that this sense of self-righteousness comes from his status as an army reservist who is trained to snap a man's neck with one hand.\n\n===Notable guest cast===\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Isabella (1998) \u2013 a love interest of Pete's who gets between him and Berg.

The episode entitled \"[[The Pilot (Two Guys and a Girl)|The Pilot]]\" was watched by almost 18 million viewers.\n\nThe story of season 1 centers around the pizza place. Actors such as [[Jennifer Westfeldt]] (Melissa), and [[Julius Carry]] (Bill) were credited as secondary cast members to principals [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Richard Ruccolo]], and [[Traylor Howard]]. Mr. Bauer, played by [[David Ogden Stiers]], frequently appeared around the pizza place, telling stories of life events which actually occurred in movies. Pete and Berg share an apartment, on which Peter pays the rent every month, with Berg testing experimental drugs to supplement their income. Pete structures his life around architecture and grad school, while Sharon, their friend upstairs, works for an [[evil corporation]] that exploits the Earth's natural resources, much to her dislike.\n\nThe episodes contained storylines including: Pete preparing for a presentation which Berg ruins; Berg stealing the Celtics' '81 championship banner; Sharon joining the softball team; and the story of how they all met. Because the episodes aired out of order, the season seems very disjointed---demonstrated by the status of Pete's relationship with Melissa: in episode 8 \u2013 \"Party\" Melissa and Pete are still together despite having previously broken up in episode 5 \u2013 \"Apartment\". On the DVD release they are episodes 2 and 7.\n\n===Season 2===\nSeason 2 had a more structured basis for each episode. Two additional primary characters arrived, Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer) and Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion), as well as the dismissal of characters Bill, Mr. Bauer, and Pete's long-time girlfriend Melissa.\n\n[[File:Two Guys And A Girl Poster Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cast during Season 2]]\n\nThe season starts with Berg's realization that someone in his class, Walker, is more clever than he is. It leads to an anticipated romance between Berg and Ashley as they both head down the path of becoming physicians. Jukebox repairman Johnny Donnelly begins a relationship with Sharon. Other secondary characters (Irene, Kamen, Shaun) are introduced throughout the season. Episodes of season 2 include: \"Two Guys, a Girl and an Engagement\", \"Two Guys, a Girl and a Valentine's Day\", and \"Two Guys, a Girl and Ashley's Return\", all of which mark turning points in the story of the show. Johnny and Sharon break up on Valentine's Day due to Sharon's jealousy of Shaun, Johnny's best friend. Berg and Ashley finally get together in \"...And Ashley's Return\". Pete confesses his feelings towards Sharon, and Johnny proposes in \"...And an Engagement\". The season ends with Sharon not giving Johnny an answer as well as her realizing she may have feelings for Pete. It left the show with a [[cliffhanger]] after ABC had renewed it for another season.\n\n===Season 3===\nThe pizza place is completely abandoned in the third season so that the characters could pursue different dreams. The premiere resolves the season two cliffhanger, with Sharon answering Johnny's proposal with 'Yes, in theory,' although she is still holding out on her feelings for Pete. Evidently, Pete flew to Paris after the night's events and returns completely over Sharon, with a new girlfriend who speaks only French and is revealed to be extremely racist. Berg and Ashley continue to build on their relationship and finally become doctors involved in psych rotations. The season portrays their relationship as unsteady and completely built on hate of one another. It leads to Berg breaking up with Ashley during the middle of the season.\n\nAshley lives with Pete and Berg before moving into her own apartment, which was originally Sharon's and Johnny's, who move to the basement to become the new supers. She starts dating [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball star [[Nomar Garciaparra]], who appears as himself. Pete finds his true calling by becoming a firefighter. He enjoys the experiences of being an honorary firefighter until the feisty Marti, played by [[Tiffani Thiessen]], comes along to thwart him at every turn. The two continue to take shots at each other until she starts dating Berg, to Pete's dislike. Pete and Berg get into a huge fight concerning Marti and consider not being roommates anymore.\n\nWhen Pete gets his acceptance letter to Fireman Boot Camp, he goes to Marti with open arms and they become an item. Pete continues to hate Berg throughout the final episodes of the season. Sharon and Johnny bicker at one another until Johnny calls off the wedding. When they get back together, they decide that a quickie wedding is the best idea. Irene, Pete's alleged stalker, agrees to throw Sharon and Johnny a wedding on the roof of the building; it results in her inviting [[Robert Goulet]], who conducts the ceremony and brings Pete and Berg back together as friends during the wedding.\n\nAt the end of the two part season finale, Pete and Marti leave to go to Fireman Boot Camp, Sharon and Johnny go on their honeymoon, and Ashley leaves to sort out a joke that Pete told Nomar, causing his and Ashley's break-up. Berg and Irene are left alone at the wedding and start to dance. The series ends with another cliffhanger as the audience is led to believe something will happen between Berg and Irene. The series was renewed for another season due to its 10.2 million average viewers during season 3.\n\n===Season 4===\nIn 2001, ABC moved the sitcom from mid-week to Friday and the show's average viewers dropped from 10.2 to 6.7 million.\n\nSeason 4 continues the story arc from the end of Season 3. Johnny and Sharon are married, Pete and Marti are now firefighters, and Berg and Irene are sleeping together. After Berg gets over being on academic probation, he continues to be Irene's \"sex buddy\". The two start sleeping together secretly, hoping that Pete won't know.\n\nJohnny continues to be the superintendent until Sharon makes him an honorary fireman for the day on his birthday. Johnny decides that he wants to be a fireman, much to Sharon's dislike. Meanwhile, Berg and Irene become a couple and Pete and Marti break up. Marti leaves Pete for Ashley's ex, Nomar. Sharon feels unfulfilled after leaving her evil corporate job and decides that she wants to be a lawyer.\n\nWhen Berg tells Irene that he loves her and she has no reply, Berg goes out and meets someone else. Katie, the girl he meets, admits that she's been following him for 8 years. The two kiss, and Berg tells Irene. Berg apologizes and Irene breaks up with him for the mailman Roger. In the final episode, Berg assumes that Irene may be pregnant and decides that he must win her back.\n\n==Series finale==\nThe series finale is titled \"[[The Internet Show]]\", and was an episode in which fans of the show voted on the outcome online. The episode aired on May 16, 2001. It was written by Donald Beck and Vince Calandra and directed by [[Michael Lembeck]].\n\nIn the episode, Sharon thinks she may be pregnant and Ashley realizes she could be too. Ashley goes into denial, despite showing symptoms, but agrees to take a pregnancy test with Sharon. When Berg finds out from a news report that a glow-in-the-dark condom he used was defective he thinks Irene could be pregnant. Not wanting to worry her, he tries to get a urine sample from her without telling her. Pete is still annoyed at Ashley for giving up on their relationship to go to Stanford.\n\nFour different endings were filmed for viewers to decide which of the central female characters (Sharon, Ashley, or Irene) should become pregnant, while the fourth possible ending had no pregnancies at all. The plan was to have the pregnant one (which ultimately ended up being Ashley) give birth at the end of the proposed fifth season. However, a fifth season of the show never materialized; by the time the fourth-season finale aired in May 2001, the show had been cancelled due to low ratings.\n\n==Ratings==\nThe show had strong ratings success during its run, peaking in season 2 with an average of 12.0 million viewers. The series premiere, titled \"[[The Pilot (Two Guys and a Girl)|The Pilot]]\", was watched by 17.94 million viewers, airing after ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.<ref name=\"Two Guys, A Girl And A Pizza Place Nielsen rating\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/mar15-1998/|title=''Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place'' Nielsen rating March 10th|publisher=mrpopculture.com|accessdate=December 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616091114/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/mar15-1998/|archive-date=June 16, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The episode got a 15.61 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] and won its 18-49 adult demographic.

It was ranked #1 in its time period with Total Viewers, outperforming ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', and ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''. It was also #1 in its time slot with key adults 18\u201349 and with all male demographics.

The title screen is accompanied by an instrumental cover of the song \"[[Blister in the Sun]]\" by the [[Violent Femmes]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe title sequence for Seasons 3 and 4 shows Pete, Berg and Sharon dancing to a more modern piece of music in front of a plain white backdrop, wearing suits and dresses. The newly adapted logo (the show's name having changed) is seen overlaying the footage as the three dance and laugh.\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[Freddy Curci]], Tom Rizzo and Mark Vogel. The music for Seasons 1 and 2 included numerous variations on the title theme, a prime example of which is \"Two Guys, a Girl and a Vacation\" where the cast members do a short rendition of \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]]. Steel drums and Caribbean instruments were used to vary the title theme within the scenes of the episode.\n\n===Crew===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n\n====Directors====\n* [[Amanda Bearse]]\n* [[Robby Benson]]\n* [[Mark Cendrowski]]\n* [[Rich Correll]]\n* Dana DeVally Piazza\n* [[John Fortenberry]]\n* [[Leonard R.

Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nSegar's ''Thimble Theatre'' strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut, but the one-eyed sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip, and ''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular properties during the 1930s. After Segar's death in 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was continued by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant [[Bud Sagendorf]]. The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by [[Hy Eisman]]. The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nIn 1933, [[Max Fleischer]] adapted the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters into a series of ''[[Popeye the Sailor (film series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' theatrical cartoon shorts for [[Paramount Pictures]]. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and Fleischer&nbsp;\u2014 and later Paramount's own [[Famous Studios]]&nbsp;\u2014 continued production through 1957.

Originally, Popeye got \"luck\" from rubbing the head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting \"strength\" from eating spinach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/popeye-facts/|title=13 Interesting Popeye the Sailorman Facts|date=December 3, 2012|work=todayifoundout.com}}</ref> [[Swee'Pea]] is Popeye's ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to [[Olive Oyl]] in cartoons.\n\nThere is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated, yet he often comes up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or the scientific community. He has displayed [[Sherlock Holmes]]-like investigative prowess, scientific ingenuity, and successful diplomatic arguments. In the animated cartoons his pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. He also eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can along with the contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nPopeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the love triangle among Popeye, Olive, and [[Bluto]], and Bluto's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often (if temporarily) renounces Popeye for Bluto.\n\n==''Thimble Theatre'' and ''Popeye'' comic strips==\n''Thimble Theatre'' was cartoonist Segar's third published strip when it first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Journal]]'' on December 19, 1919. The paper's owner, [[William Randolph Hearst]], also owned [[King Features Syndicate]], which syndicated the strip. ''Thimble Theatre'' was intended as a replacement for ''Midget Movies'' by [[Ed Wheelan]] (Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features).<ref name=\"alc\">Clark, Alan and Laurel. ''Comics: An Illustrated History''. London, Green Wood Publishing, 1992. {{ISBN|9781872532554}} (p.54)</ref> It did not attract a large audience at first, and at the end of its first decade appeared in only half a dozen newspapers.\n\nIn its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in [[theatre|theatrical]] style (hence the strip's name). It could be classified as a [[gag-a-day]] comic in those days.<ref name=\"alc\" />\n\n''Thimble Theatre's'' first main characters were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend [[Harold Hamgravy]]. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-[[adventure film|adventure]] style featuring Olive, Hamgravy, and Olive's enterprising brother [[Castor Oyl]]. Olive's parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances.<ref name=\"Character Trail\"/>\n\nPopeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/24/mode/2up/ |page=24}}</ref> Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip but, due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.<ref name=\"rg\" /><ref name=\"alc\" />\n\nThe Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result. Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, but she eventually left Hamgravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Hamgravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually, he settled down as a [[detective]] and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named [[Swee'Pea]]. Other regular characters in the strip were [[J. Wellington Wimpy]], a [[hamburger]]-loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); [[George W. Geezil]], a local [[shoemaking|cobbler]] who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and [[Eugene the Jeep]], a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with [[magic in fiction|magical]] powers. In addition, the strip featured the [[Sea Hag]], a terrible [[pirate]], as well as the last [[witch]] on Earth&nbsp;\u2014 her even more terrible sister excepted; [[Alice the Goon]], a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's [[babysitter]]; and Toar, a caveman.<ref name=\"bw\" /><ref name=\"Character Trail\"/>\n\nSegar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and [[Bluto]] made only one appearance. Segar signed some of his early Popeye comic strips with a [[cigar]], due to his last name being a [[homophone]] of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). Comics historian Brian Walker stated: \"Segar offered up a masterful blend of comedy, fantasy, satire and suspense in ''Thimble Theater Starring Popeye''\".<ref name=\"bw\" />\n\n''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s. A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April 1937 issue of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine voted ''Popeye'' their second-favorite comic strip (after ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'').<ref name=\"bw\" /> By 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was running in 500 newspapers, and over 600 licensed \"Popeye\" products were on sale.<ref name=\"bw\" /> The success of the strip meant Segar was earning $100,000 a year at the time of his death.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Following an eventual name change to ''Popeye'' in the 1970s, the comic remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. After Mussolini came to power in Italy, he banned all American comic strips, but Popeye was so popular the Italians made him bring it back.{{Citation needed| date= December 2018}} The strip  continued after Segar's death in 1938; a series of artists performed the work. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip ''Popeye the Sailorman'' was established.\n\n===Toppers===\n''Thimble Theatre'' had a number of [[topper (comic strip)|topper strips]] on the Sunday page during its run; the main topper, ''Sappo'', ran for 21 years, from Feb 28, 1926 to May 18, 1947. (''Sappo'' was a revival of an earlier Segar daily strip called ''The Five-Fifteen'' aka ''Sappo the Commuter'', which ran from Feb 9, 1921 to Feb 17, 1925.) For seven weeks in 1936, Segar replaced ''Sappo'' with ''Pete and Pansy -- For Kids Only'' (Sept 27 - Nov 8, 1936).<ref name=Holtz>{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567}}</ref>\n\nThere were also a series of topper panel strips that ran next to Sappo; Segar drew one of them, ''Popeye's Cartoon Club'' (April 8, 1934 - May 5, 1935). The rest were produced by [[Joe Musial]] and [[Bud Sagendorf]]: ''Wiggle Line Movie'' (Sept 11 - Nov 13, 1938), ''Wimpy's Zoo's Who'' (Nov 20, 1938 - Dec 1, 1940), ''Play-Store'' (Dec 8, 1940 - July 18, 1943), ''Popeye's Army and Navy'' (July 25-Sept 12, 1943),  ''Pinup Jeep'' (Sept 19, 1943 - April 2, 1944), and ''Me Life by Popeye'' (April 9, 1944-?).<ref name=Holtz/>\n\n===Artists after Segar===\n{{original research|section|date=January 2020}}<!--notably the (uncited) paragraph about Sagendorf-->\n[[File:Thimbledecem11951.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Tom Sims and Bill Zaboly's ''Thimble Theatre'' (December 2, 1951)]]\nAfter Segar's death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. [[Tom Sims (artist)|Tom Sims]], the son of a [[Coosa River]] channel-boat captain, continued writing ''Thimble Theatre'' strips and established the ''Popeye the Sailorman'' spin-off. [[Doc Winner]] and [[Bela Zaboly]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://lambiek.net/artists/z/zaboly_bill.htm |title=Comic creator: Bill Zaboly |work= Lambiek.net |date=June 16, 2007 |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> successively, handled the artwork during Sims's run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by [[Bud Sagendorf]] in 1959.\n\nSagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the [[Sunday strip]] until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar's assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar's classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O. G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf's new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it sometimes took an entire week of Sagendorf's daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by [[Bobby London]], who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize [[abortion]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm|  title= Bobby London Interview | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125142108/http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm |archivedate= January 25, 2010 | website= comic-art.com | accessdate=  March 29, 2013}}</ref> London's strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar's original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by [[Hy Eisman]], who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf's strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar's character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, [[theme music]] and other media based on him) became [[public domain]]<ref name=\"domain\">{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/popeye-grey-owl-and-robert-service-join-the-public-domain-1.840389 | publisher= CBC News | title= Popeye, Grey Owl and Robert Service join the public domain | date= January 12, 2009 | website= cbc.ca | accessdate= March 29, 2013}}</ref> in most countries, but remains under [[copyright]] in the US.

In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto's criminal activities. The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs, who were all identical.\n\nPopeye appeared in the British \"[[TV Comic]]\" series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye's only nemesis throughout the entire run.\n\nA variety of artists have created ''Popeye'' comic book stories since then; for example, [[George Wildman]] drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by [[Bill Pearson (American writer)|Bill Pearson]], with some issues written by [[Nick Cuti]].\n\nIn 1988, Ocean Comics released the ''Popeye Special'' written by [[Ron Fortier]] with art by [[Ben Dunn]].

The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.\n\nIn 1989, a special series of short ''Popeye'' comic books were included in specially marked boxes of [[Instant Quaker Oatmeal]], and Popeye also appeared in three TV commercials for [[Quaker Oatmeal]],<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\">{{cite web |title=Popeye snubs his spinach for oatmeal |date=1990-03-28 |page=22 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2a5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y24DAAAAIBAJ&dq=&pg=6860%2C7668970 |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> which featured a parrot delivering the tag line \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee'Pea to a musclebound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\" /> (a different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic). The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I'm Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] or [[Quakers]].<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\">{{cite web |title=Popeye's pugnacity steams up Quakers |date=1990-04-24 |author=Stieg, Bill |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UdY0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=nW4DAAAAIBAJ&dq=&pg=6674%2C6694750 |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using [[violence]] to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their [[faith]] and religious beliefs.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" /> In addition, the submissiveness of Olive Oyl went against the Quakers' emphasis on women's rights. The Quaker Oatmeal company apologized and removed the \"Popeye the Quaker Man\" reference from commercials and future comic book printings.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" />\n\nIn 2012, writer [[Roger Langridge]] teamed with cartoonists [[Bruce Ozella]], Ken Wheaton, and Tom Neely (among others) to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW's 12-issue comic book miniseries, ''Popeye'', Critic PS Hayes reviewed:\n:Langridge writes a story with a ''lot'' of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it's all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye's whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn't really need it. You'll swear that you're looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it's better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.<ref>[http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/04/25/comic-review-popeye-1/ \"Review: Popeye #1\", Geeks of Doom, April 25, 2012].

The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and ''Popeye'' cartoons, released by [[Paramount Pictures]], remained a staple of Paramount's release schedule for nearly 25 years. [[William \"Billy\" Costello|William Costello]] was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that was replicated by later performers, such as [[Jack Mercer]] and even [[Mae Questel]]. Many of the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl's extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood's most popular cartoon character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|title=GAC Forums \u2013 Popeye's Popularity \u2013 Article from 1935|publisher=Forums.goldenagecartoons.com|access-date=November 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711104313/http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/awm2.4pages/2.4langerpopeye.html |title=Popeye From Strip To Screen | website= awn.com |date= |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Segar may have used spinach as a prop a few times, it was Max Fleischer who realized its potential as a trademark. In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach becomes available, and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day, and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation. It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in ''[[The Man on the Flying Trapeze (1934 cartoon)|The Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'', where it gave him acrobatic skills.\n\n[[File:Bride and Gloom.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=24|upright=1.5|''[[Bride and Gloom (1954 film)|Bride and Gloom]]'']]\nIn May 1942, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed [[Famous Studios]]. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] soldiers, most notably the 1942 short ''[[You're a Sap, Mr. Jap]]''. In late 1943, the ''Popeye'' series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with ''Her Honor the Mare.'' Famous/Paramount continued producing the ''Popeye'' series until 1957, with ''[[Spooky Swabs]]'' being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the ''Popeye'' film catalog to [[Associated Artists Productions]], which was bought out by [[United Artists]] in 1958. Through various mergers, the rights are currently controlled by [[WarnerMedia]]'s [[Turner Entertainment]].\n\nIn 2001, [[Cartoon Network]], under the supervision of animation historian [[Jerry Beck]], created a new incarnation of ''[[The Popeye Show]]''. The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 ''Popeye'' shorts over 45 episodes, until March 2004. ''The Popeye Show'' continued to air on Cartoon Network's spin-off network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\nWhile many of the Paramount ''Popeye'' cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into [[public domain]] and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television ''[[Popeye the Sailor (TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoons, to which it retained the rights, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from [[CBS/Fox Video]] to [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] in 1986, and eventually to [[Warner Home Video]] in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the ''Popeye'' cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the black-and-white cartoons produced from 1933 to 1943. In December 2018, a fourth volume featuring the first 14 color shorts from 1943 to 1945 was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] from Warner Home Video through the [[Warner Archive Collection]].\n\n==Original television cartoons==\nIn 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons titled ''[[Popeye the Sailor (TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'', but this time for television syndication. [[Al Brodax]] served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. [[Jack Mercer]], [[Mae Questel]], and [[Jackson Beck]] returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including [[Jack Kinney|Jack Kinney Productions]], ''[[Rembrandt Films]]'' ([[William L. Snyder]] and [[Gene Deitch]]), [[Larry Harmon|Larry Harmon Productions]], [[Halas and Batchelor]], [[Paramount Cartoon Studios]] (formerly Famous Studios), and [[Southern Star Entertainment]] (formerly [[Southern Star Productions]]). The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961\u20131962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these ''Popeye'' cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary ''Popeye'' boxed set in 2004.\n\nFor these cartoons, Bluto's name was changed to \"Brutus\", as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name \"Bluto\". Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences \u2013 as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag.<ref>{{cite web |author= Ian |url= http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mpopeye.html |title=The S Dope Mailbag: Is Popeye's nemesis named Bluto or Brutus? |publisher=Straightdope.com |date= 1969-12-31|access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.\n\nPopeye, Olive Oyl, Swee'Pea and Wimpy were featured prominently in the cartoon movie \"[[Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter]]\", which debuted on October 7, 1972 as one of the episodes of ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]''. In this cartoon, Brutus also appears as a turban-wearing employee of the nemesis, Dr. Morbid Grimsby.\n\nOn September 9, 1978, ''[[The All New Popeye Hour]]'' debuted on the [[CBS]] Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while [[Marilyn Schreffler]] and [[Allan Melvin]] became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to reprise her role as Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler). ''The All New Popeye Hour'' ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled ''The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show''. It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer's death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired ''The Popeye Valentine's Day Special \u2013 Sweethearts at Sea'' on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of ''The All New Popeye Show'', from the early-1980s to 2004.\n\nPopeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', another [[Hanna-Barbera]] series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach, but eats it to boost his strength. [[Maurice LaMarche]] performed Popeye's voice; Mercer had died in 1984. The show lasted for one season.\n\n[[File:lemonaidswalk3.jpg|thumb|right|Popeye as he appeared in ''[[Drawn Together]]'']]\n\nIn 2004, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] produced a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] television special, ''[[Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy]]'', which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] performed the voice of Popeye, describing the production as \"the hardest job I ever did, ever\" and the voice of Popeye as \"like a buzzsaw on your throat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckKbQeVeAI|title=The many voices of Billy West| publisher= Penn's Sunday School| date= August 9, 2012| via= YouTube}}</ref> The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye's friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment re-released ''Popeye's Voyage'' on DVD with redesigned cover art.\n\nPopeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:\n* A typical Popeye style rescue was spoofed in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Jaws Wired Shut]]\".\n* In ''[[The Critic]]'', Jay Sherman's father Franklin flashes back to saving his wife, Popeye-style, but with  [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] instead of spinach.\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode \"The Lemon-AIDS Walk\", voiced by [[Billy West]].\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives]]\", Popeye's unique behavior and speech patterns are explained as being the result of a [[stroke]], and his massive forearm muscles are actually [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]]s.\n* Popeye co-stars in a short from ''[[Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy]]'' giving [[Bob Dylan]] a hard time for not singing his hit song, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episodes \"The Sack\", \"Squaw Bury Shortcake\" and \"Yancy the Yo-Yo Boy\", voiced by [[Dave Coulier]] (which he was known to perform often during his co-starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Full House]]'').\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' \"[[Imaginationland (disambiguation)|Imaginationland]]\" three-parter as one of the members of the Council of Nine. Popeye's appearance in one scene evoked that of the character Karl in the movie ''[[Sling Blade]]'', as Popeye sharpened a blade, much as Karl sharpened a [[lawnmower]] blade near the end of ''Sling Blade''.\n\n==Web series==\nOn December 2, 2018, a Popeye web series named ''Popeye's Island Adventures'' produced by [[WildBrain]] subsidiary [[WildBrain Spark Studios]] was premiered on its official [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gene Gustines |first1=George |title=New Popeye Videos Show What 90 Years of Spinach Can Do for a Guy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/business/media/popeye-the-sailor-cartoon.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/popeye-animated-shorts-youtube/|title=New Popeye Animated Short Series Premieres On YouTube|date=December 4, 2018|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>\n\n==Theme song==\nPopeye's theme song, titled \"'''I'm Popeye The Sailor Man'''\", composed by [[Sammy Lerner]] in 1933 for Fleischer's first [[Popeye the Sailor (film)|''Popeye the Sailor'' cartoon]],<ref>CD liner notes: ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'', 1995 MCA Records</ref> has become forever associated with the sailor. \"[[The Sailor's Hornpipe]]\" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye's theme song.\n\nA cover of the theme song, performed by [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits (album)|Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].

Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute [[radio program]], ''Popeye the Sailor'', which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye, along with most of the major supporting characters&nbsp;\u2014 Olive Oyl (Olive Lamoy), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto ([[Jackson Beck]]) and Swee'Pea ([[Mae Questel]]). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny (Jimmy Donnelly), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the [[NBC]] [[NBC#Red and Blue Networks|Red Network]] (87 episodes), initially sponsored by [[Wheatena]], a whole-wheat [[breakfast cereal]], which routinely replaced the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin's Cartoonland Band. Announcer [[Kelvin Keech]] sang (to composer Lerner's \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week.\n\nThe show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and [[Miriam Wolfe]] portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\".<ref>[http://www.old-time.com/commercials/Sounds/Popeye%20&%20Wheatena.wma 1930s ''Popeye the Sailor'' Wheatena audio clip].</ref>\n\nThe third series was sponsored by the maker of [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicles]] three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15&nbsp;pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938.\n\nOf the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are known to be preserved.\n\nPopeye was recently featured on the ''Brad and John: Mornings on KISM'' \"When Animals Attack\" segment.\n\n===Films===\n====''Popeye'' (1980)====\n[[File:Malta - Mellieha - Triq tal-Prajjet - Anchor Bay+Popeye Village 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Popeye Village]]]]\n{{Main|Popeye (film)}}\n\nDirector [[Robert Altman]] used the character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'', a 1980 live-action musical feature film, starring [[Robin Williams]] as Popeye (his first starring movie role), [[Shelley Duvall]] as Olive Oyl, and [[Paul L. Smith]] as Bluto, with songs by [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]]. The script was by [[Jules Feiffer]], who adapted the 1971 [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]] book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Productions]], the movie was filmed almost entirely on [[Malta]], in the village of [[Mellie\u0127a]] on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called [[Popeye Village]]. The US box office earnings were double the film's budget, making it a success.\n\n====Cancelled animated film====\n<!-- A DRAFT-PAGE TITLED [[Draft:Popeye (2016 film)]] IS IN WORKS -->\nIn March 2010, it was reported that [[Sony Pictures Animation]] is developing a [[3D film|3D]] computer-animated Popeye film, with [[Avi Arad]] producing it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=64471 |title= Sony making a CG Popeye Film |publisher= comingsoon.net |date=March 23, 2010}}</ref> In November 2011, Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn, the writers of ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'', are writing the screenplay for the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sony Pictures Animation and Arad Productions Set Jay Scherick & David Ronn to Write Animated POPEYE|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-pictures-animation-and-arad-productions-set-jay-scherick--david-ronn-to-write-animated-popeye-133185523.html|access-date=November 3, 2011|newspaper=Sony Pictures Animation \"via\" PR Newswire|date=November 3, 2011}}</ref> In June 2012, it was reported that [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] had been set to direct the feature,<ref name=Popeye>{{cite news|last=Abrams|first=Rachel|title=Helmer moves Sony's 3D 'Popeye' forward|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118055946|access-date=June 26, 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> which he planned to make \"as artful and unrealistic as possible.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=Genndy Tartakovsky gets 'Hotel Transylvania' open for business|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hotel-transylvania-20120826,0,3490529.story|access-date=August 28, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 25, 2012}}</ref> In November 2012, Sony Pictures Animation set the release date for September 26, 2014,<ref name=THRHT2Popeye>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Hotel Transylvania 2' in the Works for 2015 Release|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/hotel-transylvania-2-works-2015-388315|access-date=November 10, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> which was, in May 2013, pushed back to 2015<!-- Why is it pushed back in 2015? -->.<ref name=A113Popeye2015>{{cite news|last=Jardine|first=William|title=Sony Pushes Genndy Tartakovsky's Popeye Back to 2015|url=http://www.a113animation.com/2013/05/genndy-tartakovsky-popeye-delayed-to-2015.html|access-date=May 22, 2013|newspaper=A113Animation|date=May 17, 2013}}</ref> In March 2014, Sony Pictures Animation updated its slate, scheduling the film for 2016, and announcing Tartakovsky as the director of ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'', which he was directing concurrently with ''Popeye''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Sony Animation Sets Slate: 'Smurfs', 'Transylvania 2,' More (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-animation-sets-slate-smurfs-687526|access-date=May 3, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref> On September 18, 2014, Tartakovsky revealed an \"animation test\" footage, about which he said, \"It's just something that kind of represents what we want to do.

The [[handheld electronic game|handheld game]] featured Popeye on a boat, and the aim was to catch [[bottle]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto's boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his [[mallet]] or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end.\n* The Nintendo arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was originally conceived as a ''Popeye'' video game by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. However, due to licensing disagreements with King Features, this idea was scrapped.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. Wii \u2013 Mario Couldn't Jump At First |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_new_super_mario_bros_wii_16795_16846.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=July 14, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n* When ''Donkey Kong'' went on to enormous success, King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a [[Popeye (video game)|''Popeye'' arcade game]] in 1982. It was later ported to the [[Commodore 64]] [[home computer]] as well as various [[video game console|home game consoles]]: [[Intellivision]], [[Atari 2600]], Atari 8-bit family, [[ColecoVision]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], and [[Odyssey2|Odyssey<sup>2</sup>]]. The goal was to avoid Bluto (referred to as \"Brutus\") and the Sea Hag while collecting items produced by Olive Oyl such as [[heart (symbol)|hearts]], [[musical note]]s, or the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in the word \"help\" (depending on the level). Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus. Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee' Pea appeared in the game, but did not greatly affect gameplay. A [[board game]] based on the video game was released by [[Parker Brothers]].\n* A table top Game & Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983, which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto.\n* Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom, ''[[Popeye no Eigo Asobi]]'', in 1983. This was an educational game designed to teach Japanese children English words.\n* A different ''Popeye'' game was developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Don Priestley]] and first released by [[DK'Tronics]] in 1985. The game achieved critical success due to its huge, colourful sprites; amongst the largest seen on the Spectrum platform.<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/20/popeye.htm ''Popeye'' review] from CRASH issue 20, September 1985; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition</ref><ref>[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr19/yr19_41.htm ''Popeye'' review] from ''Your Spectrum'' issue 19, October 1985</ref> This distinct graphical style was due to King Features' insistence that any game had to include fair representations of the central cartoon characters. The game was ported to [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986. After releasing the budget version of this game, [[Alternative Software]] developed another two licensed games, ''Popeye 2'' (1991) and ''Popeye 3: Wrestle Crazy'' (1992) on the same platforms.\n* Two Popeye games published by [[Sigma Enterprises]] were spawned for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]]. The first Game Boy ''[[Popeye (Game Boy)|Popeye]]'' game, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1990, and ''[[Popeye 2]]'' in 1991. ''Popeye 2'' was also released in North America (1993) and Europe (1994) by [[Activision]].\n* In 1994, [[Technos Japan]] released ''[[Popeye: Beach Volleyball]]'' for the [[Game Gear]], and ''Popeye: Volume of the Malicious Witch Seahag'' (''[[Popeye: Ijiwaru Majo Shihaggu no Maki]]'') for the Japanese [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. A side scrolling adventure game that was mixed with a board game, the game never saw US release. It featured many characters from the ''Thimble Theatre'' series as well. In the game, Popeye had to recover [[magic in fiction|magical]] hearts scattered across the level to restore his frozen friends as part of a spell cast upon them by the Sea Hag in order to get revenge on Popeye.\n* [[Midway Games|Midway]] (under the ''[[Bally Technologies|Bally]]'' label) released ''[[Popeye Saves the Earth]]'', a [[SuperPin]] [[pinball]] game, in 1994.\n* In 2003, Nova Productions released a strength tester called ''Popeye Strength Tester''.\n* In 2005, [[Bandai Namco]] released a [[Game Boy Advance]] video game called ''[[Popeye: Rush for Spinach]]''.\n* Released June 2007, the video game ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' featured [[television set|televisions]] that played full-length films and television shows that had expired copyrights. Most of the cartoons viewable on the \"Toon TV\" channel are Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts.\n* In fall 2007, Namco Networks released the original Nintendo ''Popeye'' arcade game for mobile phones with new features including enhanced graphics and new levels.\n\n===Parodies===\n* A parody of Popeye, by the name of Captain Strong who gets his powers from hallucinogenic alien seaweed, makes his appearance in the [[DC Comics]] limited series ''Harley Quinn''.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (2014 series) #18-19</ref>\n\n===Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements===\nFrom early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to [[razor blade]]s to spinach was available with Popeye's likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced.\n\n;Games and toys\n* [[Mezco Toyz]] makes classic-style Popeye [[action figure|figures]] in two sizes.\n* KellyToys produces plush [[stuffed toy|stuffed]] Popeye characters.\n\n;Restaurants\n* Wimpy's name was borrowed for the [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]] restaurant chain, one of the first international fast food restaurants featuring hamburgers, which they call \"Wimpy Burgers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpyburgers.co.uk/|title=Wimpy Burger \u2013 Junk Food Heath Advice \u2013 Wimpy Burgers, learn the truth|work=wimpyburgers.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n;Retail foods and beverages\n* [[Alma, Arkansas|Allen Canning Company]] produces its own line of spinach, called \"Popeye Spinach\", in various canned varieties.

Popeye appeared with [[Sonny the Cuckoo Bird]] in a three-part commercial for [[Cocoa Puffs]] cereal.\n* In 1989, Popeye endorsed Instant Quaker Oatmeal, citing it as a better food than spinach to provide strength.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\" /> The commercials had the tagline \"Can the spinach, I wants me Quaker Oatmeal!\" The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as the Quakers) was offended by the promotion given the physical aggression from \"Popeye the Quaker man\" and also the excessive submissiveness of Olive Oyl.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" />\n* In 2001, Popeye (along with Bluto, Olive, and twin Wimpys) appeared in a television commercial for [[Minute Maid]] [[Orange juice]]. The commercial, produced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Co]], showed Popeye and Bluto as friends (and neglecting Olive Oyl) due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning. The ad agency's intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice, but some, including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute, felt the commercial's intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship; even so, it is a suggestion that Minute Maid denies. Knight was interviewed by [[Stephen Colbert]] on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' about this issue.\n* World Candies Inc. produced Popeye-branded \"[[candy cigarette]]s\", which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate embers. They were sold in a small box, similar to a cigarette pack. The company still produces the item, but has since changed the name to \"Popeye Candy Sticks\" and has ceased putting the red dye at the end.\n* In 2013, McLean Design produced a packaging design using licensed characters and artwork for a Popeye branded energy drink. The drink is launching in the US with two flavors.<ref>[http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ Punchy packaging for Popeye energy drink | Food And Beverage News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112121/http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ |date=March 4, 2016}}.

Released was a stamped, numbered and signed Limited Edition lithograph, edition size of 395. The lithograph shows Popeye and Olive Oyl in front of the preacher (Popeye slipping a lifesaver-ring onto Olive's finger) along with Nana Oyl, Alice the Goon, Swee'Pea (cradled in Popeye's free arm), Wimpy, Granny, Eugene the Jeep and Brutus (holding a large cauldron of steaming, cooked rice). Twenty-one other characters watch from the pews. The litho is titled \"Wit Dis Lifesaver, I Dee Wed!\" and is pictured on page 83 of the book \"Chicken Fat\" by Will Elder (Fantagraphics, 2006).\n* In 1990, Popeye appeared in an advertisement warning of the harmful effects of coastal pollution.

Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nSegar's ''Thimble Theatre'' strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut, but the one-eyed sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip, and ''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular properties during the 1930s. After Segar's death in 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was continued by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant [[Bud Sagendorf]]. The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by [[Hy Eisman]]. The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nIn 1933, [[Max Fleischer]] adapted the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters into a series of ''[[Popeye the Sailor (film series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' theatrical cartoon shorts for [[Paramount Pictures]]. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and Fleischer&nbsp;\u2014 and later Paramount's own [[Famous Studios]]&nbsp;\u2014 continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by [[Turner Entertainment]] and distributed by its sister company [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/%E2%80%9Cpopeye%E2%80%9D-comes-dvd-warner-home-video/|title=Popeye comes to DVD from Warner Home Video}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, video games, hundreds of advertisements,<ref name=\"rg\" /> peripheral products ranging from spinach to [[candy cigarettes]], and the [[Popeye (film)|1980 live-action film]] directed by [[Robert Altman]] and starring [[Robin Williams]] as Popeye.\n\n[[Charles M. Schulz]] said, \"I think ''Popeye'' was a perfect comic strip, consistent in drawing and humor\".<ref>Mendelson, Lee and Schulz, Charles M., ''Charlie Brown and Charlie Schulz: in celebration of the 20th anniversary of \"Peanuts\"''.

Originally, Popeye got \"luck\" from rubbing the head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting \"strength\" from eating spinach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/popeye-facts/|title=13 Interesting Popeye the Sailorman Facts|date=December 3, 2012|work=todayifoundout.com}}</ref> [[Swee'Pea]] is Popeye's ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to [[Olive Oyl]] in cartoons.\n\nThere is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated, yet he often comes up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or the scientific community. He has displayed [[Sherlock Holmes]]-like investigative prowess, scientific ingenuity, and successful diplomatic arguments. In the animated cartoons his pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. He also eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can along with the contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.<ref name=\"rg\" />\n\nPopeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the love triangle among Popeye, Olive, and [[Bluto]], and Bluto's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often (if temporarily) renounces Popeye for Bluto.\n\n==''Thimble Theatre'' and ''Popeye'' comic strips==\n''Thimble Theatre'' was cartoonist Segar's third published strip when it first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Journal]]'' on December 19, 1919. The paper's owner, [[William Randolph Hearst]], also owned [[King Features Syndicate]], which syndicated the strip. ''Thimble Theatre'' was intended as a replacement for ''Midget Movies'' by [[Ed Wheelan]] (Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features).<ref name=\"alc\">Clark, Alan and Laurel. ''Comics: An Illustrated History''. London, Green Wood Publishing, 1992. {{ISBN|9781872532554}} (p.54)</ref> It did not attract a large audience at first, and at the end of its first decade appeared in only half a dozen newspapers.\n\nIn its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in [[theatre|theatrical]] style (hence the strip's name). It could be classified as a [[gag-a-day]] comic in those days.<ref name=\"alc\" />\n\n''Thimble Theatre's'' first main characters were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend [[Harold Hamgravy]]. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-[[adventure film|adventure]] style featuring Olive, Hamgravy, and Olive's enterprising brother [[Castor Oyl]]. Olive's parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances.<ref name=\"Character Trail\"/>\n\nPopeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/24/mode/2up/ |page=24}}</ref> Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip but, due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.<ref name=\"rg\" /><ref name=\"alc\" />\n\nThe Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result. Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, but she eventually left Hamgravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Hamgravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually, he settled down as a [[detective]] and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named [[Swee'Pea]]. Other regular characters in the strip were [[J. Wellington Wimpy]], a [[hamburger]]-loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); [[George W. Geezil]], a local [[shoemaking|cobbler]] who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and [[Eugene the Jeep]], a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with [[magic in fiction|magical]] powers. In addition, the strip featured the [[Sea Hag]], a terrible [[pirate]], as well as the last [[witch]] on Earth&nbsp;\u2014 her even more terrible sister excepted; [[Alice the Goon]], a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's [[babysitter]]; and Toar, a caveman.<ref name=\"bw\" /><ref name=\"Character Trail\"/>\n\nSegar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and [[Bluto]] made only one appearance. Segar signed some of his early Popeye comic strips with a [[cigar]], due to his last name being a [[homophone]] of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). Comics historian Brian Walker stated: \"Segar offered up a masterful blend of comedy, fantasy, satire and suspense in ''Thimble Theater Starring Popeye''\".<ref name=\"bw\" />\n\n''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s. A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April 1937 issue of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine voted ''Popeye'' their second-favorite comic strip (after ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'').<ref name=\"bw\" /> By 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was running in 500 newspapers, and over 600 licensed \"Popeye\" products were on sale.<ref name=\"bw\" /> The success of the strip meant Segar was earning $100,000 a year at the time of his death.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Following an eventual name change to ''Popeye'' in the 1970s, the comic remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. After Mussolini came to power in Italy, he banned all American comic strips, but Popeye was so popular the Italians made him bring it back.{{Citation needed| date= December 2018}} The strip  continued after Segar's death in 1938; a series of artists performed the work. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip ''Popeye the Sailorman'' was established.\n\n===Toppers===\n''Thimble Theatre'' had a number of [[topper (comic strip)|topper strips]] on the Sunday page during its run; the main topper, ''Sappo'', ran for 21 years, from Feb 28, 1926 to May 18, 1947. (''Sappo'' was a revival of an earlier Segar daily strip called ''The Five-Fifteen'' aka ''Sappo the Commuter'', which ran from Feb 9, 1921 to Feb 17, 1925.) For seven weeks in 1936, Segar replaced ''Sappo'' with ''Pete and Pansy -- For Kids Only'' (Sept 27 - Nov 8, 1936).<ref name=Holtz>{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567}}</ref>\n\nThere were also a series of topper panel strips that ran next to Sappo; Segar drew one of them, ''Popeye's Cartoon Club'' (April 8, 1934 - May 5, 1935). The rest were produced by [[Joe Musial]] and [[Bud Sagendorf]]: ''Wiggle Line Movie'' (Sept 11 - Nov 13, 1938), ''Wimpy's Zoo's Who'' (Nov 20, 1938 - Dec 1, 1940), ''Play-Store'' (Dec 8, 1940 - July 18, 1943), ''Popeye's Army and Navy'' (July 25-Sept 12, 1943),  ''Pinup Jeep'' (Sept 19, 1943 - April 2, 1944), and ''Me Life by Popeye'' (April 9, 1944-?).<ref name=Holtz/>\n\n===Artists after Segar===\n{{original research|section|date=January 2020}}<!--notably the (uncited) paragraph about Sagendorf-->\n[[File:Thimbledecem11951.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Tom Sims and Bill Zaboly's ''Thimble Theatre'' (December 2, 1951)]]\nAfter Segar's death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. [[Tom Sims (artist)|Tom Sims]], the son of a [[Coosa River]] channel-boat captain, continued writing ''Thimble Theatre'' strips and established the ''Popeye the Sailorman'' spin-off. [[Doc Winner]] and [[Bela Zaboly]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://lambiek.net/artists/z/zaboly_bill.htm |title=Comic creator: Bill Zaboly |work= Lambiek.net |date=June 16, 2007 |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> successively, handled the artwork during Sims's run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by [[Bud Sagendorf]] in 1959.\n\nSagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the [[Sunday strip]] until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar's assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar's classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O. G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf's new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it sometimes took an entire week of Sagendorf's daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by [[Bobby London]], who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize [[abortion]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm|  title= Bobby London Interview | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125142108/http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm |archivedate= January 25, 2010 | website= comic-art.com | accessdate=  March 29, 2013}}</ref> London's strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar's original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by [[Hy Eisman]], who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf's strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar's character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, [[theme music]] and other media based on him) became [[public domain]]<ref name=\"domain\">{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/popeye-grey-owl-and-robert-service-join-the-public-domain-1.840389 | publisher= CBC News | title= Popeye, Grey Owl and Robert Service join the public domain | date= January 12, 2009 | website= cbc.ca | accessdate= March 29, 2013}}</ref> in most countries, but remains under [[copyright]] in the US.

Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.

In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto's criminal activities. The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs, who were all identical.\n\nPopeye appeared in the British \"[[TV Comic]]\" series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye's only nemesis throughout the entire run.\n\nA variety of artists have created ''Popeye'' comic book stories since then; for example, [[George Wildman]] drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by [[Bill Pearson (American writer)|Bill Pearson]], with some issues written by [[Nick Cuti]].\n\nIn 1988, Ocean Comics released the ''Popeye Special'' written by [[Ron Fortier]] with art by [[Ben Dunn]]. The story presented Popeye's origin story, including his given name of \"Ugly Kidd\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sterling|first=Mike|title=I Sorta Do and Sorta Don't Want This to Be Officially Part of Popeye's Backstory|url=http://www.progressiveruin.com/2012/09/20/i-sorta-do-and-sorta-dont-want-this-to-be-officially-part-of-popeyes-backstory/|publisher=Progressive Ruin|access-date=December 11, 2013|date=September 20, 2012}}</ref> and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor.

The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.\n\nIn 1989, a special series of short ''Popeye'' comic books were included in specially marked boxes of [[Instant Quaker Oatmeal]], and Popeye also appeared in three TV commercials for [[Quaker Oatmeal]],<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\">{{cite web |title=Popeye snubs his spinach for oatmeal |date=1990-03-28 |page=22 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2a5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y24DAAAAIBAJ&dq=&pg=6860%2C7668970 |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> which featured a parrot delivering the tag line \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee'Pea to a musclebound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\" /> (a different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic). The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I'm Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] or [[Quakers]].<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\">{{cite web |title=Popeye's pugnacity steams up Quakers |date=1990-04-24 |author=Stieg, Bill |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UdY0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=nW4DAAAAIBAJ&dq=&pg=6674%2C6694750 |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using [[violence]] to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their [[faith]] and religious beliefs.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" /> In addition, the submissiveness of Olive Oyl went against the Quakers' emphasis on women's rights. The Quaker Oatmeal company apologized and removed the \"Popeye the Quaker Man\" reference from commercials and future comic book printings.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" />\n\nIn 2012, writer [[Roger Langridge]] teamed with cartoonists [[Bruce Ozella]], Ken Wheaton, and Tom Neely (among others) to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW's 12-issue comic book miniseries, ''Popeye'', Critic PS Hayes reviewed:\n:Langridge writes a story with a ''lot'' of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it's all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye's whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn't really need it. You'll swear that you're looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it's better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.<ref>[http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/04/25/comic-review-popeye-1/ \"Review: Popeye #1\", Geeks of Doom, April 25, 2012].

The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and ''Popeye'' cartoons, released by [[Paramount Pictures]], remained a staple of Paramount's release schedule for nearly 25 years. [[William \"Billy\" Costello|William Costello]] was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that was replicated by later performers, such as [[Jack Mercer]] and even [[Mae Questel]]. Many of the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl's extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood's most popular cartoon character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|title=GAC Forums \u2013 Popeye's Popularity \u2013 Article from 1935|publisher=Forums.goldenagecartoons.com|access-date=November 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711104313/http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/awm2.4pages/2.4langerpopeye.html |title=Popeye From Strip To Screen | website= awn.com |date= |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Segar may have used spinach as a prop a few times, it was Max Fleischer who realized its potential as a trademark. In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach becomes available, and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day, and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation. It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in ''[[The Man on the Flying Trapeze (1934 cartoon)|The Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'', where it gave him acrobatic skills.\n\n[[File:Bride and Gloom.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=24|upright=1.5|''[[Bride and Gloom (1954 film)|Bride and Gloom]]'']]\nIn May 1942, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed [[Famous Studios]]. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] soldiers, most notably the 1942 short ''[[You're a Sap, Mr. Jap]]''. In late 1943, the ''Popeye'' series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with ''Her Honor the Mare.'' Famous/Paramount continued producing the ''Popeye'' series until 1957, with ''[[Spooky Swabs]]'' being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the ''Popeye'' film catalog to [[Associated Artists Productions]], which was bought out by [[United Artists]] in 1958. Through various mergers, the rights are currently controlled by [[WarnerMedia]]'s [[Turner Entertainment]].\n\nIn 2001, [[Cartoon Network]], under the supervision of animation historian [[Jerry Beck]], created a new incarnation of ''[[The Popeye Show]]''. The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 ''Popeye'' shorts over 45 episodes, until March 2004. ''The Popeye Show'' continued to air on Cartoon Network's spin-off network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\nWhile many of the Paramount ''Popeye'' cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into [[public domain]] and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television ''[[Popeye the Sailor (TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoons, to which it retained the rights, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from [[CBS/Fox Video]] to [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] in 1986, and eventually to [[Warner Home Video]] in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the ''Popeye'' cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the black-and-white cartoons produced from 1933 to 1943. In December 2018, a fourth volume featuring the first 14 color shorts from 1943 to 1945 was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] from Warner Home Video through the [[Warner Archive Collection]].\n\n==Original television cartoons==\nIn 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons titled ''[[Popeye the Sailor (TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'', but this time for television syndication. [[Al Brodax]] served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. [[Jack Mercer]], [[Mae Questel]], and [[Jackson Beck]] returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including [[Jack Kinney|Jack Kinney Productions]], ''[[Rembrandt Films]]'' ([[William L. Snyder]] and [[Gene Deitch]]), [[Larry Harmon|Larry Harmon Productions]], [[Halas and Batchelor]], [[Paramount Cartoon Studios]] (formerly Famous Studios), and [[Southern Star Entertainment]] (formerly [[Southern Star Productions]]). The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961\u20131962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these ''Popeye'' cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary ''Popeye'' boxed set in 2004.\n\nFor these cartoons, Bluto's name was changed to \"Brutus\", as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name \"Bluto\". Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences \u2013 as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag.<ref>{{cite web |author= Ian |url= http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mpopeye.html |title=The S Dope Mailbag: Is Popeye's nemesis named Bluto or Brutus? |publisher=Straightdope.com |date= 1969-12-31|access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.\n\nPopeye, Olive Oyl, Swee'Pea and Wimpy were featured prominently in the cartoon movie \"[[Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter]]\", which debuted on October 7, 1972 as one of the episodes of ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]''. In this cartoon, Brutus also appears as a turban-wearing employee of the nemesis, Dr. Morbid Grimsby.\n\nOn September 9, 1978, ''[[The All New Popeye Hour]]'' debuted on the [[CBS]] Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while [[Marilyn Schreffler]] and [[Allan Melvin]] became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to reprise her role as Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler). ''The All New Popeye Hour'' ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled ''The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show''. It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer's death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired ''The Popeye Valentine's Day Special \u2013 Sweethearts at Sea'' on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of ''The All New Popeye Show'', from the early-1980s to 2004.\n\nPopeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', another [[Hanna-Barbera]] series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach, but eats it to boost his strength. [[Maurice LaMarche]] performed Popeye's voice; Mercer had died in 1984. The show lasted for one season.\n\n[[File:lemonaidswalk3.jpg|thumb|right|Popeye as he appeared in ''[[Drawn Together]]'']]\n\nIn 2004, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] produced a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] television special, ''[[Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy]]'', which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] performed the voice of Popeye, describing the production as \"the hardest job I ever did, ever\" and the voice of Popeye as \"like a buzzsaw on your throat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckKbQeVeAI|title=The many voices of Billy West| publisher= Penn's Sunday School| date= August 9, 2012| via= YouTube}}</ref> The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye's friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment re-released ''Popeye's Voyage'' on DVD with redesigned cover art.\n\nPopeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:\n* A typical Popeye style rescue was spoofed in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Jaws Wired Shut]]\".\n* In ''[[The Critic]]'', Jay Sherman's father Franklin flashes back to saving his wife, Popeye-style, but with  [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] instead of spinach.\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode \"The Lemon-AIDS Walk\", voiced by [[Billy West]].\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives]]\", Popeye's unique behavior and speech patterns are explained as being the result of a [[stroke]], and his massive forearm muscles are actually [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]]s.\n* Popeye co-stars in a short from ''[[Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy]]'' giving [[Bob Dylan]] a hard time for not singing his hit song, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episodes \"The Sack\", \"Squaw Bury Shortcake\" and \"Yancy the Yo-Yo Boy\", voiced by [[Dave Coulier]] (which he was known to perform often during his co-starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Full House]]'').\n* Popeye appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' \"[[Imaginationland (disambiguation)|Imaginationland]]\" three-parter as one of the members of the Council of Nine. Popeye's appearance in one scene evoked that of the character Karl in the movie ''[[Sling Blade]]'', as Popeye sharpened a blade, much as Karl sharpened a [[lawnmower]] blade near the end of ''Sling Blade''.\n\n==Web series==\nOn December 2, 2018, a Popeye web series named ''Popeye's Island Adventures'' produced by [[WildBrain]] subsidiary [[WildBrain Spark Studios]] was premiered on its official [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gene Gustines |first1=George |title=New Popeye Videos Show What 90 Years of Spinach Can Do for a Guy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/business/media/popeye-the-sailor-cartoon.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/popeye-animated-shorts-youtube/|title=New Popeye Animated Short Series Premieres On YouTube|date=December 4, 2018|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>\n\n==Theme song==\nPopeye's theme song, titled \"'''I'm Popeye The Sailor Man'''\", composed by [[Sammy Lerner]] in 1933 for Fleischer's first [[Popeye the Sailor (film)|''Popeye the Sailor'' cartoon]],<ref>CD liner notes: ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'', 1995 MCA Records</ref> has become forever associated with the sailor. \"[[The Sailor's Hornpipe]]\" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye's theme song.\n\nA cover of the theme song, performed by [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits (album)|Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].

Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute [[radio program]], ''Popeye the Sailor'', which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye, along with most of the major supporting characters&nbsp;\u2014 Olive Oyl (Olive Lamoy), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto ([[Jackson Beck]]) and Swee'Pea ([[Mae Questel]]). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny (Jimmy Donnelly), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the [[NBC]] [[NBC#Red and Blue Networks|Red Network]] (87 episodes), initially sponsored by [[Wheatena]], a whole-wheat [[breakfast cereal]], which routinely replaced the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin's Cartoonland Band. Announcer [[Kelvin Keech]] sang (to composer Lerner's \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week.\n\nThe show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and [[Miriam Wolfe]] portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\".<ref>[http://www.old-time.com/commercials/Sounds/Popeye%20&%20Wheatena.wma 1930s ''Popeye the Sailor'' Wheatena audio clip].</ref>\n\nThe third series was sponsored by the maker of [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicles]] three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15&nbsp;pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938.\n\nOf the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are known to be preserved.\n\nPopeye was recently featured on the ''Brad and John: Mornings on KISM'' \"When Animals Attack\" segment.\n\n===Films===\n====''Popeye'' (1980)====\n[[File:Malta - Mellieha - Triq tal-Prajjet - Anchor Bay+Popeye Village 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Popeye Village]]]]\n{{Main|Popeye (film)}}\n\nDirector [[Robert Altman]] used the character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'', a 1980 live-action musical feature film, starring [[Robin Williams]] as Popeye (his first starring movie role), [[Shelley Duvall]] as Olive Oyl, and [[Paul L.

The script was by [[Jules Feiffer]], who adapted the 1971 [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]] book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Productions]], the movie was filmed almost entirely on [[Malta]], in the village of [[Mellie\u0127a]] on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called [[Popeye Village]].

The [[handheld electronic game|handheld game]] featured Popeye on a boat, and the aim was to catch [[bottle]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto's boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his [[mallet]] or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end.\n* The Nintendo arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was originally conceived as a ''Popeye'' video game by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. However, due to licensing disagreements with King Features, this idea was scrapped.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. Wii \u2013 Mario Couldn't Jump At First |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_new_super_mario_bros_wii_16795_16846.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=July 14, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n* When ''Donkey Kong'' went on to enormous success, King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a [[Popeye (video game)|''Popeye'' arcade game]] in 1982. It was later ported to the [[Commodore 64]] [[home computer]] as well as various [[video game console|home game consoles]]: [[Intellivision]], [[Atari 2600]], Atari 8-bit family, [[ColecoVision]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], and [[Odyssey2|Odyssey<sup>2</sup>]]. The goal was to avoid Bluto (referred to as \"Brutus\") and the Sea Hag while collecting items produced by Olive Oyl such as [[heart (symbol)|hearts]], [[musical note]]s, or the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in the word \"help\" (depending on the level). Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus. Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee' Pea appeared in the game, but did not greatly affect gameplay. A [[board game]] based on the video game was released by [[Parker Brothers]].\n* A table top Game & Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983, which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto.\n* Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom, ''[[Popeye no Eigo Asobi]]'', in 1983. This was an educational game designed to teach Japanese children English words.\n* A different ''Popeye'' game was developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Don Priestley]] and first released by [[DK'Tronics]] in 1985. The game achieved critical success due to its huge, colourful sprites; amongst the largest seen on the Spectrum platform.<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/20/popeye.htm ''Popeye'' review] from CRASH issue 20, September 1985; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition</ref><ref>[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr19/yr19_41.htm ''Popeye'' review] from ''Your Spectrum'' issue 19, October 1985</ref> This distinct graphical style was due to King Features' insistence that any game had to include fair representations of the central cartoon characters. The game was ported to [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986. After releasing the budget version of this game, [[Alternative Software]] developed another two licensed games, ''Popeye 2'' (1991) and ''Popeye 3: Wrestle Crazy'' (1992) on the same platforms.\n* Two Popeye games published by [[Sigma Enterprises]] were spawned for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]]. The first Game Boy ''[[Popeye (Game Boy)|Popeye]]'' game, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1990, and ''[[Popeye 2]]'' in 1991. ''Popeye 2'' was also released in North America (1993) and Europe (1994) by [[Activision]].\n* In 1994, [[Technos Japan]] released ''[[Popeye: Beach Volleyball]]'' for the [[Game Gear]], and ''Popeye: Volume of the Malicious Witch Seahag'' (''[[Popeye: Ijiwaru Majo Shihaggu no Maki]]'') for the Japanese [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. A side scrolling adventure game that was mixed with a board game, the game never saw US release. It featured many characters from the ''Thimble Theatre'' series as well. In the game, Popeye had to recover [[magic in fiction|magical]] hearts scattered across the level to restore his frozen friends as part of a spell cast upon them by the Sea Hag in order to get revenge on Popeye.\n* [[Midway Games|Midway]] (under the ''[[Bally Technologies|Bally]]'' label) released ''[[Popeye Saves the Earth]]'', a [[SuperPin]] [[pinball]] game, in 1994.\n* In 2003, Nova Productions released a strength tester called ''Popeye Strength Tester''.\n* In 2005, [[Bandai Namco]] released a [[Game Boy Advance]] video game called ''[[Popeye: Rush for Spinach]]''.\n* Released June 2007, the video game ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' featured [[television set|televisions]] that played full-length films and television shows that had expired copyrights. Most of the cartoons viewable on the \"Toon TV\" channel are Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts.\n* In fall 2007, Namco Networks released the original Nintendo ''Popeye'' arcade game for mobile phones with new features including enhanced graphics and new levels.\n\n===Parodies===\n* A parody of Popeye, by the name of Captain Strong who gets his powers from hallucinogenic alien seaweed, makes his appearance in the [[DC Comics]] limited series ''Harley Quinn''.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (2014 series) #18-19</ref>\n\n===Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements===\nFrom early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to [[razor blade]]s to spinach was available with Popeye's likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced.\n\n;Games and toys\n* [[Mezco Toyz]] makes classic-style Popeye [[action figure|figures]] in two sizes.\n* KellyToys produces plush [[stuffed toy|stuffed]] Popeye characters.\n\n;Restaurants\n* Wimpy's name was borrowed for the [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]] restaurant chain, one of the first international fast food restaurants featuring hamburgers, which they call \"Wimpy Burgers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpyburgers.co.uk/|title=Wimpy Burger \u2013 Junk Food Heath Advice \u2013 Wimpy Burgers, learn the truth|work=wimpyburgers.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n;Retail foods and beverages\n* [[Alma, Arkansas|Allen Canning Company]] produces its own line of spinach, called \"Popeye Spinach\", in various canned varieties. The cartoon Popeye serves as the [[mascot]] on the can.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popeyespinach.com/ |title= Popeye Spinach|publisher= Popeye Spinach |date= |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* In 1961, Buitoni Pasta marketed Popeye-shaped spinach [[macaroni]].\n* Popeye appeared in a 1979 [[Dr Pepper]] commercial during the \"Be a Pepper\" campaign (possibly as a [[Popeye (film)|tie-in for the movie]], going so far as to modify his traditional [[catchphrase]] to \"...and Popeye the '''Pepper'''-man\").\n* Since 1989, \"Popeye's Supplements\" has been a chain of Canadian Sports Nutrition Stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popeyescanada.com/history.html|title=Popeye's Supplements Canada ~ Over 120 Locations Across Canada!&nbsp;\u2014 History|work=popeyescanada.com}}</ref>\n* In 1987. Popeye appeared with [[Sonny the Cuckoo Bird]] in a three-part commercial for [[Cocoa Puffs]] cereal.\n* In 1989, Popeye endorsed Instant Quaker Oatmeal, citing it as a better food than spinach to provide strength.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal\" /> The commercials had the tagline \"Can the spinach, I wants me Quaker Oatmeal!\" The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as the Quakers) was offended by the promotion given the physical aggression from \"Popeye the Quaker man\" and also the excessive submissiveness of Olive Oyl.<ref name=\"popeye_oatmeal_offense\" />\n* In 2001, Popeye (along with Bluto, Olive, and twin Wimpys) appeared in a television commercial for [[Minute Maid]] [[Orange juice]]. The commercial, produced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Co]], showed Popeye and Bluto as friends (and neglecting Olive Oyl) due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning. The ad agency's intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice, but some, including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute, felt the commercial's intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship; even so, it is a suggestion that Minute Maid denies. Knight was interviewed by [[Stephen Colbert]] on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' about this issue.\n* World Candies Inc. produced Popeye-branded \"[[candy cigarette]]s\", which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate embers. They were sold in a small box, similar to a cigarette pack. The company still produces the item, but has since changed the name to \"Popeye Candy Sticks\" and has ceased putting the red dye at the end.\n* In 2013, McLean Design produced a packaging design using licensed characters and artwork for a Popeye branded energy drink. The drink is launching in the US with two flavors.<ref>[http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ Punchy packaging for Popeye energy drink | Food And Beverage News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112121/http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ |date=March 4, 2016}}.

Released was a stamped, numbered and signed Limited Edition lithograph, edition size of 395. The lithograph shows Popeye and Olive Oyl in front of the preacher (Popeye slipping a lifesaver-ring onto Olive's finger) along with Nana Oyl, Alice the Goon, Swee'Pea (cradled in Popeye's free arm), Wimpy, Granny, Eugene the Jeep and Brutus (holding a large cauldron of steaming, cooked rice). Twenty-one other characters watch from the pews. The litho is titled \"Wit Dis Lifesaver, I Dee Wed!\" and is pictured on page 83 of the book \"Chicken Fat\" by Will Elder (Fantagraphics, 2006).\n* In 1990, Popeye appeared in an advertisement warning of the harmful effects of coastal pollution. Bluto is laughing as he carelessly dumps garbage over the side of his boat, to which Olive reacts in horror as [[seagull]]s and other sea creatures are caught in [[six pack rings|six pack ring holders]]. Popeye punches out Bluto and cleans up his garbage; however, when some more plastic garbage sails by Popeye's boat, he says unsurprisingly, \"I can't do it all meself, you know!\"\n* In 1995, the ''Popeye'' comic strip was one of 20 included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps.\n* From 1996 to 1999, the [[Darien Lake]] theme park in Western New York operated a \"Popeye's Seaport\" in the park.

MGM/UA's pre-May 1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained in time and Popeye's cameo was dropped from the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54379/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/overview |title=Who Framed Roger Rabbit \u2013 Trailer \u2013 Cast \u2013 Showtimes \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The Popeye dance===\nThe Popeye was a popular dance in the [[dance craze]] era of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

[[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] part of [[Lanarkshire]], the city now forms the Glasgow City council area, one of the 32 [[council areas of Scotland]]; the local authority is [[Glasgow City Council]]. Glasgow is situated on the [[River Clyde]] in the country's [[Scottish Lowlands|West Central Lowlands]]. It is the fifth most visited city in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/popular-uk-cities-for-international-visitors-1661845 | title=Top 20 Most Popular Cities in the UK for International Visitors | access-date=9 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709150510/https://www.tripsavvy.com/popular-uk-cities-for-international-visitors-1661845 | archive-date=9 July 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nInhabitants of the city are referred to as \"Glaswegians\" or, informally, as \"Weegies\". Glasgow is also known for the [[Glasgow patter]], a distinct dialect of the [[Scots language]] that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city.\n\nGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain.

It is also recorded that the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|King of Strathclyde]], [[Rhydderch Hael]], welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the [[Molendinar Burn]] where [[Glasgow Cathedral]] now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as ''Glasgu'' (often glossed as \"the dear Green\" or \"dear green place\").\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Glasgow}}\n\n===Origins and development===\nThe area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the [[River Clyde]] providing a natural location for fishing. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] later built outposts in the area and, to keep Roman [[Britannia]] separate from the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Caledonia]], constructed the [[Antonine Wall]]. Items from the wall, such as altars from [[Castra|Roman forts]] like [[Balmuildy]], can be found at the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] today.\n\nGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian [[missionary]] [[Saint Mungo]] in the 6th century. He established a church on the [[Molendinar Burn]], where the present [[Glasgow Cathedral]] stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries.

The founding of the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1451 and elevation of the [[Diocese|bishopric]] to become the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]] in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The City of Glasgow \u2013 The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, published 1958</ref>\n\nFollowing the European Protestant [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and with the encouragement of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]], the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their [[Merchants House]] in the same year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of [[Royal Burgh]] in 1611. Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the [[Triangular trade|Atlantic triangular slave trade]].\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'', that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\".

This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\n\nIn 1450, John Stewart, the first [[Lord Provost]] of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum, near [[Glasgow Green]].\n\nThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of [[benediction]]\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold [[mural crown]] between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\n\nThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of [[Glasgow District Council]] on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.<ref>Urquhart, R.M. (1979). ''Scottish Civic Heraldry''. London.

The [[Politics of Glasgow|city council]] was controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for over thirty years, since the decline of the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the [[single transferable vote]] rather than the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]], the dominance of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] within the city started to decline. As a result of the [[2017 United Kingdom local elections]], the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]], with one [[Battle of George Square|uprising in January 1919]] prompting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A [[Battle of George Square|huge demonstration]] in the city's [[George Square]] on 31 January ended in violence after the [[Riot Act]] was read.\n\n[[Industrial action]] at the shipyards gave rise to the \"[[Red Clydeside]]\" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP since the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|1982 Hillhead by-election]], when the [[Social Democratic Party|SDP]] took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour [[Lord Provost of Glasgow|Lord Provost]].\n\nGlasgow is represented in both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[London]], and the [[Scottish Parliament]] in Holyrood, [[Edinburgh]]. At Westminster, it is represented by seven members of parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen MSPs, of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by\n9 [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs, 4 [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] MSPs, 2 [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and 1 [[Scottish Green Party|Scottish Green]] MSP. In the European Parliament, the city forms part of the Scotland constituency, which elects six Members of the European Parliament.\n\n===Central government===\n{{Main|Glasgow Parliamentary Constituencies}} \n{{See also|Glasgow Scottish Parliament region|United Kingdom constituencies}}\nSince Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for.\n\n====Scottish Parliament====\nThe [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament]] covers the Glasgow City council area, the [[Rutherglen]] area of the [[South Lanarkshire]] and a small eastern portion of [[Renfrewshire]]. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 [[first past the post]] constituency members and seven of the 56 [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional members]]. Both kinds of member are known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)]]. The system of election is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].\n\nThe first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] ([[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]] representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.\n\nCurrently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:\n* [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]]\n* [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]]\n* [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]]\n* [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn]]\n* [[Glasgow Pollok (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Pollok]]\n* [[Glasgow Provan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Provan]]\n* [[Glasgow Shettleston (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]]\n* [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]]\n* [[Rutherglen (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]]\n\nAt the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], all nine of these constituencies were won by [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] MSPs, two [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and one [[Scottish Green Party|Green]] MSP.\n\n====UK Westminster Parliament====\nFollowing reform of constituencies of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]], the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:\n* [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]]\n* [[Glasgow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow East]]\n* [[Glasgow North (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North]]\n* [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]]\n* [[Glasgow North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North West]]\n* [[Glasgow South (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South]]\n* [[Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South West]]\n\nFollowing the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] won every constituency in the city at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the seat of [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|title=Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live|date=8 May 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nSince the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap election]], Glasgow is currently represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by [[Paul Sweeney]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP [[Anne McLaughlin]] by 242 votes.\n\n====Referendums====\nIn the [[Scottish independence referendum]], Glasgow voted \"Yes\" by a margin of [[2014 Scottish independence referendum#By area|53.5% to 46.5%]].\n\nIn the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]], results varied from constituency to constituency.

All are located to the West of the city centre.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas.

Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around {{convert|-12|\u00b0C}} in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\n\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above {{convert|20|\u00b0C}}. Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (81&nbsp;\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\n\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe.

Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the [[Gorbals]] and relocation to \"[[New town#United Kingdom|new towns]]\" such as [[East Kilbride]] and [[Cumbernauld]] led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult. The city continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around {{convert|400|sqmi|km2|-1}} of all adjoining suburbs, if [[commuter town]]s and villages are included.

The wider Govan area includes the districts of [[Ibrox, Glasgow|Ibrox]], [[Cessnock, Glasgow|Cessnock]], [[Kinning Park]] and [[Kingston, Glasgow|Kingston]].\n\n===North Glasgow===\n[[File:Ruchill Church at canal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Ruchill Church Hall|Ruchill Church]], seen from the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]]]]\nNorth Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of [[Bearsden]], [[Milngavie]] and [[Bishopbriggs]] in [[East Dunbartonshire]] and [[Clydebank]] in [[West Dunbartonshire]]. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas. [[Possilpark]] is one such district, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and [[Hamiltonhill]] have fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as [[Ruchill]], which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern [[housing estate]]s. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented [[social housing]], with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and [[Glasgow Housing Association]].\n\n[[Maryhill]] consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as [[Maryhill Park]] and [[North Kelvinside]]. Maryhill is also the location of [[Firhill Stadium]], home of [[Partick Thistle F.C.]] since 1909. The [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] team, [[Maryhill F.C.]] are also located in this part of north Glasgow.\n\nThe [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.\n\n[[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]] was home to Scotland's largest [[asylum seeker]] community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nicoll |first1=Vivienne |title=Starting gun sounds for regeneration of Sighthill |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |website=eveningtimes.co.uk |accessdate=26 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114753/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |archive-date=26 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in [[Springburn]], where the [[Saracen Foundry]], engineering works of firms like [[Charles Tennant]] and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the [[North British Locomotive Company]]. Today part of the [[Glasgow Works]] continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn.

Also in the 15th century began the building of [[Cathcart Castle]], completed C.1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions.

The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\".

The [[shipyard]]s, [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], steel making, and [[heavy industry]] all contributed to the growth of the city.\n\nMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond [[sandstone]], but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the [[furnace]]s, until the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act]] was introduced in 1956.

[[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] part of [[Lanarkshire]], the city now forms the Glasgow City council area, one of the 32 [[council areas of Scotland]]; the local authority is [[Glasgow City Council]]. Glasgow is situated on the [[River Clyde]] in the country's [[Scottish Lowlands|West Central Lowlands]].

Glasgow is also known for the [[Glasgow patter]], a distinct dialect of the [[Scots language]] that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city.\n\nGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the [[medieval]] [[Archbishop of Glasgow|bishopric]] and [[royal burgh]], and the later establishment of the [[University of Glasgow]] in the fifteenth century, it became a major centre of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] in the eighteenth century. From the eighteenth century onwards, the city also grew as one of Great Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with [[British America|North America]] and the [[British West Indies|West Indies]].\n\nWith the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the [[shipbuilding]] and [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]] industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the [[Victorian era]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian period]], although [[Second city of the United Kingdom|many cities argue the title was theirs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml|title=Victorian Glasgow|accessdate=14 September 2010|publisher=BBC History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514172952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml|archive-date=14 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The+Second+City.htm |title=About Glasgow: The Second City of the Empire&nbsp;\u2014 the 19th century |accessdate=9 July 2007 |publisher=Glasgow City Council |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402171109/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The%2BSecond%2BCity.htm |archivedate=2 April 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=W, H |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914 |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105124204/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |archive-date=5 January 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McIlvanney |first=W |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |title=Glasgow&nbsp;\u2013 city of reality |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 the official online gateway |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204064459/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |archive-date=4 December 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |title=Factsheet 4: Population |publisher=Glasgow City Council |accessdate=9 July 2007 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703130648/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2007}}</ref> Comprehensive [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated [[new town]]s, such as [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], [[East Kilbride]] and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes.

It is also recorded that the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|King of Strathclyde]], [[Rhydderch Hael]], welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the [[Molendinar Burn]] where [[Glasgow Cathedral]] now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as ''Glasgu'' (often glossed as \"the dear Green\" or \"dear green place\").\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Glasgow}}\n\n===Origins and development===\nThe area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the [[River Clyde]] providing a natural location for fishing. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] later built outposts in the area and, to keep Roman [[Britannia]] separate from the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Caledonia]], constructed the [[Antonine Wall]]. Items from the wall, such as altars from [[Castra|Roman forts]] like [[Balmuildy]], can be found at the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] today.\n\nGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian [[missionary]] [[Saint Mungo]] in the 6th century. He established a church on the [[Molendinar Burn]], where the present [[Glasgow Cathedral]] stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries. The [[Glasgow Fair]] reportedly began in the year 1190.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindsay|first1=Sir John|title=The City of Glasgow : its origin, growth and development ; with maps and plates|date=1921|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society|location=Edinburgh|page=26|url=https://archive.org/stream/cityofglasgowits00newb#page/26/mode/2up/search/1190|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> The [[Lowest bridging point|first bridge]] over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main North-South route over the river via [[Glasgow Cross]]. The founding of the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1451 and elevation of the [[Diocese|bishopric]] to become the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]] in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The City of Glasgow \u2013 The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, published 1958</ref>\n\nFollowing the European Protestant [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and with the encouragement of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]], the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their [[Merchants House]] in the same year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of [[Royal Burgh]] in 1611. Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the [[Triangular trade|Atlantic triangular slave trade]].\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'', that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\".

This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\n\nIn 1450, John Stewart, the first [[Lord Provost]] of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum, near [[Glasgow Green]].\n\nThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of [[benediction]]\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold [[mural crown]] between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\n\nThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of [[Glasgow District Council]] on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.<ref>Urquhart, R.M. (1979). ''Scottish Civic Heraldry''. London.

The [[Politics of Glasgow|city council]] was controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for over thirty years, since the decline of the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the [[single transferable vote]] rather than the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]], the dominance of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] within the city started to decline. As a result of the [[2017 United Kingdom local elections]], the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]], with one [[Battle of George Square|uprising in January 1919]] prompting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A [[Battle of George Square|huge demonstration]] in the city's [[George Square]] on 31 January ended in violence after the [[Riot Act]] was read.\n\n[[Industrial action]] at the shipyards gave rise to the \"[[Red Clydeside]]\" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP since the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|1982 Hillhead by-election]], when the [[Social Democratic Party|SDP]] took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour [[Lord Provost of Glasgow|Lord Provost]].\n\nGlasgow is represented in both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[London]], and the [[Scottish Parliament]] in Holyrood, [[Edinburgh]]. At Westminster, it is represented by seven members of parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen MSPs, of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by\n9 [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs, 4 [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] MSPs, 2 [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and 1 [[Scottish Green Party|Scottish Green]] MSP. In the European Parliament, the city forms part of the Scotland constituency, which elects six Members of the European Parliament.\n\n===Central government===\n{{Main|Glasgow Parliamentary Constituencies}} \n{{See also|Glasgow Scottish Parliament region|United Kingdom constituencies}}\nSince Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for.\n\n====Scottish Parliament====\nThe [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament]] covers the Glasgow City council area, the [[Rutherglen]] area of the [[South Lanarkshire]] and a small eastern portion of [[Renfrewshire]]. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 [[first past the post]] constituency members and seven of the 56 [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional members]]. Both kinds of member are known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)]]. The system of election is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].\n\nThe first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] ([[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]] representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.\n\nCurrently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:\n* [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]]\n* [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]]\n* [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]]\n* [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn]]\n* [[Glasgow Pollok (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Pollok]]\n* [[Glasgow Provan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Provan]]\n* [[Glasgow Shettleston (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]]\n* [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]]\n* [[Rutherglen (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]]\n\nAt the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], all nine of these constituencies were won by [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] MSPs, two [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and one [[Scottish Green Party|Green]] MSP.\n\n====UK Westminster Parliament====\nFollowing reform of constituencies of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]], the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:\n* [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]]\n* [[Glasgow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow East]]\n* [[Glasgow North (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North]]\n* [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]]\n* [[Glasgow North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North West]]\n* [[Glasgow South (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South]]\n* [[Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South West]]\n\nFollowing the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] won every constituency in the city at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the seat of [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|title=Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live|date=8 May 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nSince the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap election]], Glasgow is currently represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by [[Paul Sweeney]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP [[Anne McLaughlin]] by 242 votes.\n\n====Referendums====\nIn the [[Scottish independence referendum]], Glasgow voted \"Yes\" by a margin of [[2014 Scottish independence referendum#By area|53.5% to 46.5%]].\n\nIn the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]], results varied from constituency to constituency.

All are located to the West of the city centre.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the annual precipitation averages {{convert|1245|mm|1}}.

Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around {{convert|-12|\u00b0C}} in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\n\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above {{convert|20|\u00b0C}}. Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (81&nbsp;\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\n\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe.

Govan has a legacy as an engineering and [[shipbuilding]] centre of international repute and is home to one of two [[BAE Systems Surface Ships|BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards]] on the River Clyde and the [[precision engineering]] firm, [[Thales Optronics]]. It is also home to the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]], one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the [[Glasgow Subway]] system.

''Ginger'' is a term for any carbonated soft drink, historically referring to [[ginger beer]] (''A bottle o ginger'', {{IPA-sco|\u0259 \u02c8bo\u0294l \u0259 \u02c8d\u0292\u026and\u0292\u0259r|IPA}}).

Also in the 15th century began the building of [[Cathcart Castle]], completed C.1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle [[Mary Queen of Scots]] supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the [[Battle of Langside]] in May 1568. The Castle was Demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the city as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of [[Victorian architecture]]: the [[Glasgow City Chambers]]; the main building of the [[University of Glasgow]], designed by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]]; and the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John W.

Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the main exponent of [[Art Nouveau]] in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the [[Glasgow School of Art]], [[Willow Tearooms]] and the [[Scotland Street School Museum]].

The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The [[shipyard]]s, [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], steel making, and [[heavy industry]] all contributed to the growth of the city.\n\nMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond [[sandstone]], but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the [[furnace]]s, until the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act]] was introduced in 1956.
