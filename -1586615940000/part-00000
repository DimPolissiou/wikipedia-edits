This is a distinct problem for self-report research because it does not allow a researcher to understand or gather accurate data from any type of question that asks for a participant to endorse or reject statements.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/> Researchers have approached this issue by thinking about the bias in two different ways. The first deals with the idea that participants are trying to be agreeable, in order to avoid the disapproval of the researcher.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/> A second cause for this type of bias was proposed by [[Lee Cronbach]], when he argued that it is likely due to a problem in the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] of the participant, instead of the motivation to please the researcher.<ref name=\"Cronbach\"/> He argues that it may be due to biases in memory where an individual recalls information that supports endorsement of the statement, and ignores contradicting information.<ref name=\"Cronbach\"/>\n\nResearchers have several methods to try and reduce this form of bias. Primarily, they attempt to make balanced response sets in a given measure, meaning that there are a balanced number of positively and negatively worded questions.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/><ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879|pmid=14516251|title=Common method biases in behavioral research: A critical review of the literature and recommended remedies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=88|issue=5|pages=879\u2013903|year=2003|last1=Podsakoff|first1=Philip M.|last2=MacKenzie|first2=Scott B.|last3=Lee|first3=Jeong-Yeon|last4=Podsakoff|first4=Nathan P.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e832a69d84e612af3d7fff75027e0e018ed5e836}}</ref> This means that if a researcher was hoping to examine a certain trait with a given questionnaire, half of the questions would have a \"yes\" response to identify the trait, and the other half would have a \"no\" response to identify the trait.<ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/>\n\nNay-saying is the opposite form of this bias. It occurs when a participant always chooses to deny or not endorse any statements in a survey or measure. This has a similar effect of invalidating any kinds of endorsements that participants may make over the course of the experiment.\n\n===Demand characteristics===\n{{Main|Demand characteristics}}\n\nDemand characteristics refer to a type of response bias where participants alter their response or behavior simply because they are part of an experiment.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> This arises because participants are actively engaged in the experiment, and may try to figure out the purpose, or adopt certain [[Human behavior|behaviors]] they believe belong in an experimental setting. [[Martin Orne]] was one of the first to identify this type of bias, and has developed several theories to address their cause.<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAMeF0JOtY0C&pg=PA110 |title=Artifacts in Behavioral Research |last=Orne |first=Martin T. |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-538554-0 |editor-last=Rosenthal |editor-first=Robert |pages=110\u2013137 |chapter=Demand Characteristics and the Concept of Quasi-Controls |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195385540.003.0005 |editor-last2=Rosnow |editor-first2=Ralph L.}}</ref> His research points to the idea that participants enter a certain type of social interaction when engaging in an experiment, and this special social interaction drives participants to [[Consciousness|consciously]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] alter their behaviors<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> There are several ways that this bias can influence participants and their responses in an experimental setting. One of the most common relates to the motivations of the participant. Many people choose to volunteer to be in studies because they believe that experiments are important. This drives participants to be \"good subjects\" and fulfill their role in the experiment properly, because they believe that their proper participation is vital to the success of the study.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/GENP.135.2.151-166|pmid=18507315|title=The Good-Subject Effect: Investigating Participant Demand Characteristics|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=135|issue=2|pages=151\u2013165|year=2008|last1=Nichols|first1=Austin Lee|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.}}</ref> Thus, in an attempt to productively participate, the subject may try to gain knowledge of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment and alter their behavior in an attempt to support that [[hypothesis]]. Orne conceptualized this change by saying that the experiment may appear to a participant as a problem, and it is his or her job to find the solution to that problem, which would be behaving in a way that would lend support to the experimenter's hypothesis.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> Alternatively, a participant may try to discover the hypothesis simply to provide faulty information and wreck the hypothesis.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> Both of these results are harmful because they prevent the experimenters from gathering accurate data and making sound conclusions.\n\nOutside of participant motivation, there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> Additionally, the [[Nonverbal communication|mannerisms]] of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Cook 1970\" /> Also, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/><ref name=\"Cook 1970\" /> Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their [[Mental health professional|therapist]].<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-reporting measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/>  All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/>\n\nWhile demand characteristics cannot be completely removed from an experiment, there are steps that researchers can take to minimize the impact they may have on the results.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> One way to mitigate response bias is to use deception to prevent the participant from discovering the true hypothesis of the experiment<ref name=\"Cook 1970\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0028849|title=Demand characteristics and three conceptions of the frequently deceived subject|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=185\u2013194|year=1970|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and then [[Debriefing|debrief]] the participants.<ref name=\"Cook 1970\"/> For example, research has demonstrated that repeated deception and debriefing is useful in preventing participants from becoming familiar with the experiment, and that participants do not significantly alter their behaviors after being deceived and debriefed multiple times.<ref name=\"Cook 1970\"/> Another way that researchers attempt to reduce demand characteristics is by being as [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] as possible, or training those conducting the experiment to be as neutral as possible.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> For example, studies show that extensive one-on-one contact between the experimenter and the participant makes it more difficult to be neutral, and go on to suggest that this type of interaction should be limited when designing an experiment.<ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> Another way to prevent demand characteristics is to use [[Blind experiment|blinded]] experiments with [[placebo]]s or [[Treatment and control groups|control groups]].<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/> This prevents the experimenter from biasing the participant, because the researcher does not know in which way the participant should respond. Although not perfect, these methods can significantly reduce the effect of demand characteristics on a study, thus making the conclusions drawn from the experiment more likely to accurately reflect what they were intended to measure.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/>\n\n===Extreme responding===\n\nExtreme responding is a form of response bias that drives respondents to only select the most extreme options or answers available.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> For example, in a survey utilizing a [[Likert scale]] with potential responses ranging from one to five, the respondent may only give answers as ones or fives. Another example is if the participant only answered questionnaires with \"strongly agree\" or \"strongly disagree\" in a survey with that type of response style. There are several reasons for why this bias may take hold in a group of participants. One example ties the development of this type of bias in respondents to their cultural identity.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> This explanation states that people from certain cultures are more likely to respond in an extreme manner as compared to others. For example, research has found that those from the Middle East and Latin America are more prone to be affected by extremity response, whereas those from East Asia and Western Europe are less likely to be affected.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> A second explanation for this type of response bias relates to the education level of the participants.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> Research has indicated that those with lower intelligence, measured by an analysis of [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and school achievement, are more likely to be affected by extremity response.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/>  Another way that this bias can be introduced is through the wording of questions in a survey or questionnaire.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> Certain topics or the wording of a question may drive participants to respond in an extreme manner, especially if it relates to the motivations or beliefs of the participant.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\nThe opposite of this bias occurs when participants only select intermediate or mild responses as answers.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\n=== Question order bias ===\nQuestion order bias, or \"order effects bias\", is a type of response bias where a respondent may react differently to questions based on the order in which questions appear in a survey or interview.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blankenship |first=Albert |date=1942 |title=Psychological Difficulties in Measuring Consumer Preference |journal=Journal of Marketing |language=en |volume=6 |issue=4, part 2 |pages=66\u201375 |doi=10.1177/002224294200600420.1 |jstor=1246085}}</ref> Question order bias is different from \"response order bias\" that addresses specifically the order of the set of responses within a survey question.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Israel |first=Glenn D. |last2=Taylor |first2=C.L. |date=1990 |title=Can response order bias evaluations? |journal=Evaluation and Program Planning |language=en |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=365\u2013371 |doi=10.1016/0149-7189(90)90021-N}}</ref> There are many ways that questionnaire items that appear earlier in a survey can affect responses to later questions.

One was asked on whether the United States should allow reporters from communist countries to come to the U.S. and send back news as they saw it; and another question was asked on whether a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back news as they saw it to America. In the study, the percentage of \u201cyes\u201d responses to the question allowing communist reporters increased by 37 percentage points depending on the order. Similarly results for the American reporters item increased by 24 percentage points. When either of the items was asked second, the context for the item was changed as a result of the answer to the first, and the responses to the second were more in line with what would be considered fair, based on the previous response.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|last=Lavrakas|first=Paul J.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|year=2008|isbn=9781412918084|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=664\u2013665}}</ref> Another way to alter the response towards questions based on order depends on the framing of the question.

Some strategies to limit the effects of question order bias include randomization, grouping questions by topic to unfold in a logical order.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/|title=Questionnaire design|date=2015-01-29|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Social desirability bias===\n{{Main|Social desirability bias}}\n\nSocial desirability bias is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> In essence, it is a bias that drives an individual to answer in a way that makes them look more favorable to the experimenter.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> This bias can take many forms. Some individuals may over-report good behavior, while others may under-report bad, or undesirable behavior.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> A critical aspect of how this bias can come to affect the responses of participants relates to the norms of the society in which the research is taking place.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> For example, social desirability bias could play a large role if conducting research about an individual's tendency to use drugs. Those in a community where drug use is seen as acceptable or popular may exaggerate their own drug use, whereas those from a community where drug use is looked down upon may choose to under-report their own use. This type of bias is much more prevalent in questions that draw on a subject's opinion, like when asking a participant to evaluate or rate something, because there generally is not one correct answer, and the respondent has multiple ways they could answer the question.<ref name=\"Kalton\"/> Overall, this bias can be very problematic for self-report researchers, especially if the topic they are looking at is controversial.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> The distortions created by respondents answering in a socially desirable manner can have profound effects on the validity of self-report research.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Without being able to control for or deal with this bias, researchers are unable to determine if the effects they are measuring are due to individual differences, or from a desire to [[Conformity|conform to the societal norms]] present in the population they are studying. Therefore, researchers strive to employ strategies aimed at mitigating social desirability bias so that they can draw valid conclusions from their research.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\nSeveral strategies exist to limit the effect of social desirability bias. In 1985, Anton Nederhof compiled a list of techniques and methodological strategies for researchers to use to mitigate the effects of social desirability bias in their studies.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Most of these strategies involve deceiving the subject, or are related to the way questions in surveys and questionnaires are presented to those in a study. A condensed list of seven of the strategies are listed below:\n*'''Ballot-box method''': This method allows a subject to anonymously self-complete a questionnaire and submit it to a locked \"ballot box\", thereby concealing their responses from an interviewer and affording the participant an additional layer of assured concealment from perceived social repercussion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Bova |first=Christopher S. |last2=Aswani |first2=Shankar |last3=Farthing |first3=Matthew W. |last4=Potts |first4=Warren M. |date=2018 |title=Limitations of the random response technique and a call to implement the ballot box method for estimating recreational angler compliance using surveys |journal=Fisheries Research |language=en |volume=208 |pages=34\u201341 |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2018.06.017}}</ref>\n*'''Forced-choice items''': This technique hopes to generate questions that are equal in desirability to prevent a socially desirable response in one direction or another.<ref name=\"Nederhof\" />\n*'''Neutral questions''': The goal of this strategy is to use questions that are rated as neutral by a wide range of participants so that socially desirable responding does not apply.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''[[Randomized response|Randomized response technique]]''': This technique allows participants to answer a question that is randomly selected from a set of questions. The researcher in this technique does not know which question the subject responds to, so subjects are more likely to answer truthfully. Researchers can then use statistics to interpret the anonymous data.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Self-administered questionnaires''': This strategy involves isolating the participant before they begin answering the survey or questionnaire to hopefully remove any social cues the researcher may present to the participant.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Bogus-pipeline''': This technique involves a form of deception, where researchers convince a subject through a series of rigged demonstrations that a machine can accurately determine if a participant is being truthful when responding to certain questions. After the participant completes the survey or questionnaire, they are debriefed. This is a rare technique, and does not see much use because of the cost, time commitment and because it is a one-use only technique for each participant.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Selection interviewers''': This strategy allows participants to select the person or persons who will be conducting the interview or presiding over the experiment. This, in the hope that with a higher degree of rapport, subjects will be more likely to answer honestly.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Proxy subjects''': Instead of asking a person directly, this strategy questions someone who is close to or knows the target individual well. This technique is generally limited to questions about behavior, and is not adequate for asking about attitudes or beliefs.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n\nThe degree of effectiveness for each of these techniques or strategies differs depending on the situation and the question asked.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> In order to be the most successful in reducing social desirability bias in a wide range of situations, it has been suggested that researchers utilize a combination of these techniques to have the best chance at mitigating the effects of social desirability bias.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Validations are not made on a \"more is better\" assumption (higher stated prevalence of the behavior of interest) when selecting the best method for reducing SDB as this is a \"weak validation\" that does not always guarantee the best results. Instead, ground \"truthed\" comparisons of observed data to stated data should reveal the most accurate method.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Related terminology==\n\n*[[Non-response bias]] is not the opposite of response bias and is not a type of cognitive bias: it occurs in a [[statistical survey]] if those who respond to the survey differ in the outcome variable.\n*[[Response rate (survey)|Response rate]] is not a cognitive bias, but rather refers to a ratio of those who complete the survey and those who do not.\n\n==Highly vulnerable areas==\n\nSome areas or topics that are highly vulnerable to the various types of response bias include:\n*alcoholism<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1987.48.410|pmid=3312821|title=Verbal report methods in clinical research on alcoholism: Response bias and its minimization|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=410\u2013424|year=1987|last1=Babor|first1=T F|last2=Stephens|first2=R S|last3=Marlatt|first3=G A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1993.54.334|pmid=8487543|title=Validity and reliability of self-reported drinking behavior: Dealing with the problem of response bias|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=54|issue=3|pages=334\u2013344|year=1993|last1=Embree|first1=B G|last2=Whitehead|first2=P C}}</ref>\n*self-reporting in mental illness, especially depression<ref name=\"Knauper 1994\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Total survey error]]\n* [[Compound question]]\n* [[Heckman correction]]\n* [[Loaded question]]\n* [[Misinformation effect]], similar effect for memory instead of opinion.\n* [[Opinion poll#Potential for inaccuracy|Opinion poll]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=9613 Estimation of Response Bias in the NHES:95 Adult Education Survey]\n* [http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/20254 Effects of road sign wording on visitor survey - non-response bias]\n\n{{Biases}}\n\n[[Category:Cognitive biases]]\n[[Category:Survey methodology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Example Likert Scale.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Example Likert Scale.| A survey using a [[Likert Scale|Likert]] style response set.

This is a distinct problem for self-report research because it does not allow a researcher to understand or gather accurate data from any type of question that asks for a participant to endorse or reject statements.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/> Researchers have approached this issue by thinking about the bias in two different ways. The first deals with the idea that participants are trying to be agreeable, in order to avoid the disapproval of the researcher.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/> A second cause for this type of bias was proposed by [[Lee Cronbach]], when he argued that it is likely due to a problem in the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] of the participant, instead of the motivation to please the researcher.<ref name=\"Cronbach\"/> He argues that it may be due to biases in memory where an individual recalls information that supports endorsement of the statement, and ignores contradicting information.<ref name=\"Cronbach\"/>\n\nResearchers have several methods to try and reduce this form of bias. Primarily, they attempt to make balanced response sets in a given measure, meaning that there are a balanced number of positively and negatively worded questions.<ref name=\"Knowles 1997\"/><ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879|pmid=14516251|title=Common method biases in behavioral research: A critical review of the literature and recommended remedies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=88|issue=5|pages=879\u2013903|year=2003|last1=Podsakoff|first1=Philip M.|last2=MacKenzie|first2=Scott B.|last3=Lee|first3=Jeong-Yeon|last4=Podsakoff|first4=Nathan P.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e832a69d84e612af3d7fff75027e0e018ed5e836}}</ref> This means that if a researcher was hoping to examine a certain trait with a given questionnaire, half of the questions would have a \"yes\" response to identify the trait, and the other half would have a \"no\" response to identify the trait.<ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/>\n\nNay-saying is the opposite form of this bias.

One of the most common relates to the motivations of the participant. Many people choose to volunteer to be in studies because they believe that experiments are important. This drives participants to be \"good subjects\" and fulfill their role in the experiment properly, because they believe that their proper participation is vital to the success of the study.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/GENP.135.2.151-166|pmid=18507315|title=The Good-Subject Effect: Investigating Participant Demand Characteristics|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=135|issue=2|pages=151\u2013165|year=2008|last1=Nichols|first1=Austin Lee|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.}}</ref> Thus, in an attempt to productively participate, the subject may try to gain knowledge of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment and alter their behavior in an attempt to support that [[hypothesis]]. Orne conceptualized this change by saying that the experiment may appear to a participant as a problem, and it is his or her job to find the solution to that problem, which would be behaving in a way that would lend support to the experimenter's hypothesis.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> Alternatively, a participant may try to discover the hypothesis simply to provide faulty information and wreck the hypothesis.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> Both of these results are harmful because they prevent the experimenters from gathering accurate data and making sound conclusions.\n\nOutside of participant motivation, there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> Additionally, the [[Nonverbal communication|mannerisms]] of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Cook 1970\" /> Also, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/><ref name=\"Cook 1970\" /> Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their [[Mental health professional|therapist]].<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-reporting measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/> In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need.<ref name=\"Reese 2013\"/>  All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/>\n\nWhile demand characteristics cannot be completely removed from an experiment, there are steps that researchers can take to minimize the impact they may have on the results.<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/> One way to mitigate response bias is to use deception to prevent the participant from discovering the true hypothesis of the experiment<ref name=\"Cook 1970\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0028849|title=Demand characteristics and three conceptions of the frequently deceived subject|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=185\u2013194|year=1970|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and then [[Debriefing|debrief]] the participants.<ref name=\"Cook 1970\"/> For example, research has demonstrated that repeated deception and debriefing is useful in preventing participants from becoming familiar with the experiment, and that participants do not significantly alter their behaviors after being deceived and debriefed multiple times.<ref name=\"Cook 1970\"/> Another way that researchers attempt to reduce demand characteristics is by being as [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] as possible, or training those conducting the experiment to be as neutral as possible.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> For example, studies show that extensive one-on-one contact between the experimenter and the participant makes it more difficult to be neutral, and go on to suggest that this type of interaction should be limited when designing an experiment.<ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/><ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/> Another way to prevent demand characteristics is to use [[Blind experiment|blinded]] experiments with [[placebo]]s or [[Treatment and control groups|control groups]].<ref name=\"Orne 1962\"/><ref name=\"Podsakoff 2003\"/> This prevents the experimenter from biasing the participant, because the researcher does not know in which way the participant should respond. Although not perfect, these methods can significantly reduce the effect of demand characteristics on a study, thus making the conclusions drawn from the experiment more likely to accurately reflect what they were intended to measure.<ref name=\"Nichols 2008\"/>\n\n===Extreme responding===\n\nExtreme responding is a form of response bias that drives respondents to only select the most extreme options or answers available.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> For example, in a survey utilizing a [[Likert scale]] with potential responses ranging from one to five, the respondent may only give answers as ones or fives. Another example is if the participant only answered questionnaires with \"strongly agree\" or \"strongly disagree\" in a survey with that type of response style. There are several reasons for why this bias may take hold in a group of participants. One example ties the development of this type of bias in respondents to their cultural identity.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> This explanation states that people from certain cultures are more likely to respond in an extreme manner as compared to others. For example, research has found that those from the Middle East and Latin America are more prone to be affected by extremity response, whereas those from East Asia and Western Europe are less likely to be affected.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> A second explanation for this type of response bias relates to the education level of the participants.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/> Research has indicated that those with lower intelligence, measured by an analysis of [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and school achievement, are more likely to be affected by extremity response.<ref name=\"Meisenberg 2008\"/>  Another way that this bias can be introduced is through the wording of questions in a survey or questionnaire.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> Certain topics or the wording of a question may drive participants to respond in an extreme manner, especially if it relates to the motivations or beliefs of the participant.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\nThe opposite of this bias occurs when participants only select intermediate or mild responses as answers.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\n=== Question order bias ===\nQuestion order bias, or \"order effects bias\", is a type of response bias where a respondent may react differently to questions based on the order in which questions appear in a survey or interview.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blankenship |first=Albert |date=1942 |title=Psychological Difficulties in Measuring Consumer Preference |journal=Journal of Marketing |language=en |volume=6 |issue=4, part 2 |pages=66\u201375 |doi=10.1177/002224294200600420.1 |jstor=1246085}}</ref> Question order bias is different from \"response order bias\" that addresses specifically the order of the set of responses within a survey question.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Israel |first=Glenn D. |last2=Taylor |first2=C.L. |date=1990 |title=Can response order bias evaluations? |journal=Evaluation and Program Planning |language=en |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=365\u2013371 |doi=10.1016/0149-7189(90)90021-N}}</ref> There are many ways that questionnaire items that appear earlier in a survey can affect responses to later questions.

One was asked on whether the United States should allow reporters from communist countries to come to the U.S. and send back news as they saw it; and another question was asked on whether a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back news as they saw it to America. In the study, the percentage of \u201cyes\u201d responses to the question allowing communist reporters increased by 37 percentage points depending on the order. Similarly results for the American reporters item increased by 24 percentage points. When either of the items was asked second, the context for the item was changed as a result of the answer to the first, and the responses to the second were more in line with what would be considered fair, based on the previous response.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|last=Lavrakas|first=Paul J.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|year=2008|isbn=9781412918084|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=664\u2013665}}</ref> Another way to alter the response towards questions based on order depends on the framing of the question.

When general and specific questions are asked in different orders, results for the specific item are generally unaffected, whereas those for the general item can change significantly.<ref name=\":0\" /> Question order biases occur primarily in survey or questionnaire settings. Some strategies to limit the effects of question order bias include randomization, grouping questions by topic to unfold in a logical order.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/|title=Questionnaire design|date=2015-01-29|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Social desirability bias===\n{{Main|Social desirability bias}}\n\nSocial desirability bias is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> In essence, it is a bias that drives an individual to answer in a way that makes them look more favorable to the experimenter.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> This bias can take many forms. Some individuals may over-report good behavior, while others may under-report bad, or undesirable behavior.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> A critical aspect of how this bias can come to affect the responses of participants relates to the norms of the society in which the research is taking place.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> For example, social desirability bias could play a large role if conducting research about an individual's tendency to use drugs. Those in a community where drug use is seen as acceptable or popular may exaggerate their own drug use, whereas those from a community where drug use is looked down upon may choose to under-report their own use. This type of bias is much more prevalent in questions that draw on a subject's opinion, like when asking a participant to evaluate or rate something, because there generally is not one correct answer, and the respondent has multiple ways they could answer the question.<ref name=\"Kalton\"/> Overall, this bias can be very problematic for self-report researchers, especially if the topic they are looking at is controversial.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/> The distortions created by respondents answering in a socially desirable manner can have profound effects on the validity of self-report research.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Without being able to control for or deal with this bias, researchers are unable to determine if the effects they are measuring are due to individual differences, or from a desire to [[Conformity|conform to the societal norms]] present in the population they are studying. Therefore, researchers strive to employ strategies aimed at mitigating social desirability bias so that they can draw valid conclusions from their research.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/>\n\nSeveral strategies exist to limit the effect of social desirability bias. In 1985, Anton Nederhof compiled a list of techniques and methodological strategies for researchers to use to mitigate the effects of social desirability bias in their studies.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Most of these strategies involve deceiving the subject, or are related to the way questions in surveys and questionnaires are presented to those in a study. A condensed list of seven of the strategies are listed below:\n*'''Ballot-box method''': This method allows a subject to anonymously self-complete a questionnaire and submit it to a locked \"ballot box\", thereby concealing their responses from an interviewer and affording the participant an additional layer of assured concealment from perceived social repercussion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Bova |first=Christopher S. |last2=Aswani |first2=Shankar |last3=Farthing |first3=Matthew W. |last4=Potts |first4=Warren M. |date=2018 |title=Limitations of the random response technique and a call to implement the ballot box method for estimating recreational angler compliance using surveys |journal=Fisheries Research |language=en |volume=208 |pages=34\u201341 |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2018.06.017}}</ref>\n*'''Forced-choice items''': This technique hopes to generate questions that are equal in desirability to prevent a socially desirable response in one direction or another.<ref name=\"Nederhof\" />\n*'''Neutral questions''': The goal of this strategy is to use questions that are rated as neutral by a wide range of participants so that socially desirable responding does not apply.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''[[Randomized response|Randomized response technique]]''': This technique allows participants to answer a question that is randomly selected from a set of questions. The researcher in this technique does not know which question the subject responds to, so subjects are more likely to answer truthfully. Researchers can then use statistics to interpret the anonymous data.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Self-administered questionnaires''': This strategy involves isolating the participant before they begin answering the survey or questionnaire to hopefully remove any social cues the researcher may present to the participant.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Bogus-pipeline''': This technique involves a form of deception, where researchers convince a subject through a series of rigged demonstrations that a machine can accurately determine if a participant is being truthful when responding to certain questions. After the participant completes the survey or questionnaire, they are debriefed. This is a rare technique, and does not see much use because of the cost, time commitment and because it is a one-use only technique for each participant.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Selection interviewers''': This strategy allows participants to select the person or persons who will be conducting the interview or presiding over the experiment. This, in the hope that with a higher degree of rapport, subjects will be more likely to answer honestly.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n*'''Proxy subjects''': Instead of asking a person directly, this strategy questions someone who is close to or knows the target individual well. This technique is generally limited to questions about behavior, and is not adequate for asking about attitudes or beliefs.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/>\n\nThe degree of effectiveness for each of these techniques or strategies differs depending on the situation and the question asked.<ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> In order to be the most successful in reducing social desirability bias in a wide range of situations, it has been suggested that researchers utilize a combination of these techniques to have the best chance at mitigating the effects of social desirability bias.<ref name=\"Furnham\"/><ref name=\"Nederhof\"/> Validations are not made on a \"more is better\" assumption (higher stated prevalence of the behavior of interest) when selecting the best method for reducing SDB as this is a \"weak validation\" that does not always guarantee the best results. Instead, ground \"truthed\" comparisons of observed data to stated data should reveal the most accurate method.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Related terminology==\n\n*[[Non-response bias]] is not the opposite of response bias and is not a type of cognitive bias: it occurs in a [[statistical survey]] if those who respond to the survey differ in the outcome variable.\n*[[Response rate (survey)|Response rate]] is not a cognitive bias, but rather refers to a ratio of those who complete the survey and those who do not.\n\n==Highly vulnerable areas==\n\nSome areas or topics that are highly vulnerable to the various types of response bias include:\n*alcoholism<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1987.48.410|pmid=3312821|title=Verbal report methods in clinical research on alcoholism: Response bias and its minimization|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=410\u2013424|year=1987|last1=Babor|first1=T F|last2=Stephens|first2=R S|last3=Marlatt|first3=G A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1993.54.334|pmid=8487543|title=Validity and reliability of self-reported drinking behavior: Dealing with the problem of response bias|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=54|issue=3|pages=334\u2013344|year=1993|last1=Embree|first1=B G|last2=Whitehead|first2=P C}}</ref>\n*self-reporting in mental illness, especially depression<ref name=\"Knauper 1994\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Total survey error]]\n* [[Compound question]]\n* [[Heckman correction]]\n* [[Loaded question]]\n* [[Misinformation effect]], similar effect for memory instead of opinion.\n* [[Opinion poll#Potential for inaccuracy|Opinion poll]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=9613 Estimation of Response Bias in the NHES:95 Adult Education Survey]\n* [http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/20254 Effects of road sign wording on visitor survey - non-response bias]\n\n{{Biases}}\n\n[[Category:Cognitive biases]]\n[[Category:Survey methodology]]\n", "name_user": "IntoThinAir", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eQuestion order bias:wl", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias"}

The concert was the longest ever performed by the group, consisting of 48 songs (including guest appearances by ex.members Rio Michibayashi, Rina Yokoyama and Yukiko Nakayama). Nearly every song released by the group was performed, and the setlist was composed so that newer songs were performed first and older songs were performed last. At the end of the concert, the future paths of each of the members were announced: First Summer Uika and Nozomi Hirano would form [[Billie Idle]]; Saki Kamiya would form Pla2me with Mari Mizuta; Megumi Koshouji would form Maison Book Girl; Tentenko would start a solo/DJ career; Pour Lui would continue to perform with Lui Frontic Matsukuma Japan. In addition, in classic Bis style, a concert by \"Ex. Bis\" was announced for the next day at the Shimokitazawa Shelter. Tickets were exclusively 30,000 yen, including an \"all you can eat buffet\" (revealed on the day to be McDonald's). This July 9 show marked the true end of Bis.\n\n====Post disbandment====\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Junnosuke Watanabe, along with members of the team that initially conceived Bis would be putting together a successor group [[BiSH|Bish]]. Auditions were held and the group made their debut in March.\n\nBillie Idle held a concert titled \"Brand-new Idle Society\" on December 12, 2015, which also featured Pop, Maison Book Girl, Lui Frontic Akabane Japan and Tentenko. Following this, a joint tour of the ex.Bis members' groups titled the \"Anarchy Tour\" was announced for February~March 2016, concluding with a show at the Hibiya Yagai Ongakudo on April 29 titled \"Idle is Dead!?\".<ref>{{cite web|title=LIVE SCHEDULE|url=http://www.billieidle.com/pages/32157/LIVESCHEDULE|website=BILLIE IDLE\u00ae|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFormer Bis members Tentenko, Saki Kamiya and Rio Michibayashi collaborated with Nozomi Hirano for the song \"Douse Kieteshimau Inochi Nara...\" on \"The Official Bootleg\" EP by Billie Idle.

The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n==== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ====\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n====2018: Second major debut, more major changes====\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n====2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment====\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour.\n\n===Third generation===\n====2019: Second reformation====\nAuditions were

A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

They started their last tour from April 13 to June 29, called \"The Bis Who Sold the World Tour\", which was later extended to June 30, due to tickets selling out. On April 30, a special edit for the music video of \"Final Dance\", which is an A-side of their last single, was released onto YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinra.net/news/20140430-bis|title=BiS\u304c\u30d3\u30ad\u30cb\u59ff\u306b\u3001\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u300eFiNAL DANCE / nerve\u300f\u304b\u3089\u65b0PV\uff06\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u516c\u958b|publisher=Cinra.net}}</ref> Their final best-of album, \"[[Urya-Oi!!!]]\" was released on July 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000104103|title=BiS\u3001\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u76e4\u300e\u3046\u308a\u3083\u304a\u3044!!!\u300f\u8c6a\u83efBOX\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u300e\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u5a18\u3002\u300f\u306e\u5e2b\u8d70\u306e\u7fc1|publisher=Barks}}</ref> Tracks from \"Give me your love all\" to \"Fly\" were re-recorded with the vocals of the current six members, most of them with updated instrumentals.

The concert was the longest ever performed by the group, consisting of 48 songs (including guest appearances by ex.members Rio Michibayashi, Rina Yokoyama and Yukiko Nakayama). Nearly every song released by the group was performed, and the setlist was composed so that newer songs were performed first and older songs were performed last. At the end of the concert, the future paths of each of the members were announced: First Summer Uika and Nozomi Hirano would form [[Billie Idle]]; Saki Kamiya would form Pla2me with Mari Mizuta; Megumi Koshouji would form Maison Book Girl; Tentenko would start a solo/DJ career; Pour Lui would continue to perform with Lui Frontic Matsukuma Japan. In addition, in classic Bis style, a concert by \"Ex. Bis\" was announced for the next day at the Shimokitazawa Shelter. Tickets were exclusively 30,000 yen, including an \"all you can eat buffet\" (revealed on the day to be McDonald's). This July 9 show marked the true end of Bis.\n\n===Post disbandment===\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Junnosuke Watanabe, along with members of the team that initially conceived Bis would be putting together a successor group [[BiSH|Bish]]. Auditions were held and the group made their debut in March.\n\nBillie Idle held a concert titled \"Brand-new Idle Society\" on December 12, 2015, which also featured Pop, Maison Book Girl, Lui Frontic Akabane Japan and Tentenko. Following this, a joint tour of the ex.Bis members' groups titled the \"Anarchy Tour\" was announced for February~March 2016, concluding with a show at the Hibiya Yagai Ongakudo on April 29 titled \"Idle is Dead!?\".<ref>{{cite web|title=LIVE SCHEDULE|url=http://www.billieidle.com/pages/32157/LIVESCHEDULE|website=BILLIE IDLE\u00ae|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFormer Bis members Tentenko, Saki Kamiya and Rio Michibayashi collaborated with Nozomi Hirano for the song \"Douse Kieteshimau Inochi Nara...\" on \"The Official Bootleg\" EP by Billie Idle. The EP contains solo tracks of each of the members of Billie Idle, the above track being a Nozomi Hirano solo track. First Summer Uika, also a member of Billie Idle, participated in the track as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u30d2\u30e9\u30ce\u30ce\u30be\u30df \"\u3069\u3046\u305b\u6d88\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u547d\u306a\u3089...\"\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u89e3\u7981\uff01|url=http://www.billieidle.com/posts/294403|website=BILLIE IDLE\u00ae|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=4/6\u767a\u58f2\u300e\"4 in 1\" THE OFFICIAL BOOTLEG\u300f\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u516c\u958b\uff01|url=http://www.billieidle.com/posts/547167|website=BILLIE IDLE\u00ae|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2016: Reformation===\nExactly two years after Bis' disbandment, it was announced by former Bis leader [[Pour Lui]], sound producer Kenta Matsukuma and ex.Manager Junnosuke Watanabe, that Bis would reform under a new lineup, and auditions were going to be held. Pour Lui is the only member from the previous incarnation of Bis to be part of the line up, although ex.members are welcome to take part in the auditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u65b0\u751f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a BiS \u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|url=http://www.brandnewidolsociety.tokyo/pages/461060/page_201605111417|website=BiS Official Site|accessdate=7 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710032829/http://www.brandnewidolsociety.tokyo/pages/461060/page_201605111417|archivedate=10 July 2016|df=}}</ref> As a new beginning to Bis, a Pour Lui solo song titled \"BisBis\" was released through OTOTOY as a free download.\n\nOn the 30th of August 2016, the Bis YouTube channel uploaded videos of eleven audition finalists: Koshouji Megumu, Maina The End, Tontonko, Bug Me, Nagayama Yukiko, Yokoyama Hina, Michihayashi Rio, Terayama Yufu, Sen to Chihiro Tsuttsu, Second Summer Uika, and Hirano Nozomu.\n\nThe finalists participated in a four-day audition which was live-streamed on Niconico, following a similar format to Morning Musume's initial auditions on the TV show ASAYAN.\n\nThis audition resulted in the addition of Pour Lui, Kika Front Frontal, Aya Eightprince, Go Zeela, and Peri Ubu, who was allowed to join on the condition that she finish a bowl of curry made with [[jolokia]] hot sauce.\n\nThe five-member incarnation of the group released their first album, [[Brand-new idol Society 2]], in late 2016. The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n=== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ===\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n===2018: Second major debut, more major changes===\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n===2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment===\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour. Auditions were held in April to find members for a third iteration of the group.\n\n==Members==\n===Current===\n*Toggy\n*Ito Musensiteebu\n*Chant Monkee\n*Neo Trees\n\n===Former===\n====First

Pour Lui notes that many are difficult to watch, and Avex staff member Ryuta Ochi explains \"They [Bis] wanted to make a deliberate uglification of idol events.\"<ref name=\"cbw\">{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Clive|date=September 2013|title=Trash Yr Idols|journal=The Wire|issue=355|page=12}}</ref> The image of a typical idol is generally accepted as being pure and good-natured, which Bis reject. A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

{"title_page": "F\u00f3stbr\u0153\u00f0ra saga", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''F\u00f3stbr\u0153\u00f0ra saga''''' ({{Audio|Is-F\u00f3stbr\u00e6\u00f0ra saga.oga|listen}}) or '''''The Saga of the Sworn Brothers''''' is one of the [[Icelanders' sagas]]. It relates the deeds of the [[sworn brother]]s \u00deorgeirr and \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0r in early 11th century [[Iceland]] and abroad. \u00deorgeirr is a capable and insanely brave warrior. He kills people for trifles and for sport. \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0r is a more complicated character; warrior, trouble-maker, womanizer and poet. The saga contains poetry attributed to him, including parts of a lay on his blood brother.\n\n==Manuscripts and dating==\n\nThe saga survives in three early manuscripts. Each has a rather different version of the text:\n* [[Hauksb\u00f3k]] (earlier fourteenth century), beginning missing due to lost pages\n* [[M\u00f6\u00f0ruvallab\u00f3k]] (mid-fourteenth century), end missing due to lost pages\n* [[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]] (c. 1390)\n\nThe date of composition of the lost written archetype of ''F\u00f3stbr\u0153\u00f0ra saga'' has been the subject of considerable dispute. [[Sigur\u00f0ur Nordal]] argued for ca. 1200 (Bj\u00f6rn K. \u00deor\u00f3lfsson and [[Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson]] 1943: lxxii) whereas J\u00f3nas Kristj\u00e1nsson argued for the end of the century (1972, 310). There is no clear consensus, though Andersson's 2013 analysis preferred an early dating of 'presumably not much later than 1200' (2013, 72).\n\nA long-standing controversy centers on which manuscripts represent the most original version. In particular, the debate has focused on several unusual \"clauses\" (Icelandic ''klausur'') or asides in the saga which do not fit in with conventional saga style. These have been understood both as late interpolations and as signs of an early, developing saga style (J\u00f3nas Kristj\u00e1nsson 1972).\n\nThe [[skald]]ic stanzas attributed to \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0r kolbr\u00fanarsk\u00e1ld Bersason appear genuine (according to Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson in Bj\u00f6rn K. \u00deor\u00f3lfsson and Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson 1943: lxi); he would have composed ca. 1010-1030 (according to Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson in Bj\u00f6rn K. \u00deor\u00f3lfsson and Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson 1943: lxix).\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn the words of Lee M. Hollander (1949, 75),\n\n<blockquote>The saga of the Sworn Brothers, Thorgeir and Thormod, occupies a position of secondary importance among the Old Icelandic family sagas\u2014at least, it is not a favorite. There are good reasons for this: it does not have the scope and weight of such sagas as ''Nj\u00e1la'', ''Eigla'', ''Laxd\u00e6la'', nor the depth and classic form of such as ''Hrafnkels saga'', ''G\u00edsla saga'', ''Thorsteins saga hv\u00edta''; nor do students of Germanic antiquities value it because of any wealth of specific information on the history, religion, culture, laws of the Old North.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the saga has recently come to critical attention for the range and detail of its portrayals of women (Gos 2009).\n\n==Influence==\nThe saga is the basis for [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]]'s novel ''[[Gerpla]]'',<ref>\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson, '[https://scancan.net/eysteinsson_1_26.htm Is Halld\u00f3r Laxness the Author of ''F\u00f3stbr\u00e6\u00f0ra saga''?

In particular, the debate has focused on several unusual \"clauses\" (Icelandic ''klausur'') or asides in the saga which do not fit in with conventional saga style. These have been understood both as late interpolations and as signs of an early, developing saga style (J\u00f3nas Kristj\u00e1nsson 1972).\n\nThe [[skald]]ic stanzas attributed to \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0r kolbr\u00fanarsk\u00e1ld Bersason appear genuine (according to Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson in Bj\u00f6rn K. \u00deor\u00f3lfsson and Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson 1943: lxi); he would have composed ca. 1010-1030 (according to Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson in Bj\u00f6rn K. \u00deor\u00f3lfsson and Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson 1943: lxix).\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn the words of Lee M. Hollander (1949, 75),\n\n<blockquote>The saga of the Sworn Brothers, Thorgeir and Thormod, occupies a position of secondary importance among the Old Icelandic family sagas\u2014at least, it is not a favorite. There are good reasons for this: it does not have the scope and weight of such sagas as ''Nj\u00e1la'', ''Eigla'', ''Laxd\u00e6la'', nor the depth and classic form of such as ''Hrafnkels saga'', ''G\u00edsla saga'', ''Thorsteins saga hv\u00edta''; nor do students of Germanic antiquities value it because of any wealth of specific information on the history, religion, culture, laws of the Old North.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the saga has recently come to critical attention for the range and detail of its portrayals of women (Gos 2009).\n\n==Influence==\nThe saga is the basis for [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]]'s novel ''[[Gerpla]]'',<ref>\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson, '[https://scancan.net/eysteinsson_1_26.htm Is Halld\u00f3r Laxness the Author of ''F\u00f3stbr\u00e6\u00f0ra saga''?

Shot in [[Technicolor]], the film is an international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ireland. The plot focuses on Gorgo, a young sea monster brought back to London for exploitation, and Ogra, his even larger mother, who rampages across London to search for him.\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain Joe Ryan is salvaging for treasure off the coast of [[Ireland]], when a volcano erupts, nearly sinking his ship. Ryan and his first officer, Sam Slade, take the ship to Nara Island for repairs. As they enter harbour, they discover the floating carcasses of ancient marine animals, the first hint that something dangerous was awoken by the volcano eruption.\n\nRyan and Slade consult the harbour master, who also has archaeological pretensions: he has been salvaging in the harbour. Some of his men have disappeared mysteriously; it turns out that one has died of fear. After dark, a monstrous creature surfaces, attacks a group of fishermen, then comes ashore to wreak havoc on the island. This dinosaur-like creature is supposedly 65 feet tall. The people of the island finally drive it off.\n\nRyan and his crew manage to capture the monster and haul it aboard their ship, tying it to the deck. Soon, university scientists arrive on Nara, hoping to collect the monster for study, but Ryan has been offered a better deal by the owner of a circus in London. When the ship arrives in London, the circus owner names it \"Gorgo\", after the iconic snake-haired woman, the Gorgon [[Medusa]]. It is exhibited to the public in Battersea Park.\n\nThe scientists examine Gorgo and conclude that he is not yet an adult and that his mother must be at least 200 feet tall. On that note of foreboding, we cut to Nara Island as Ogra, the mother of Gorgo, attacks. Ogra trashes the island, sinks a [[Royal Navy]] vessel and resists attack from other warships. Later, Ogra comes ashore in London, still looking for her son, and goes on a rampage, despite being bombarded by tanks and infantry. Jets attack Ogra, but with no effect. Having demolished much of London, Ogra rescues Gorgo and both mother and son return to the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Travers]] as Captain Joe Ryan\n* [[William Sylvester]] as Sam Slade\n* [[Vincent Winter]] as Sean\n* [[Christopher Rhodes]] as McCartin\n* [[Joseph O'Conor]] as Professor Hendricks\n* [[Bruce Seton]] as Professor Flaherty\n* [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Dorkin\n* [[Basil Dignam]] as Admiral Brooks\n* Mick Dillon as Gorgo / Ogra\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally intended to be set in [[Japan]] as an homage to [[Godzilla]]; the setting was then changed to [[France]], and then finally changed to the [[British Isles]]. According to [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]]'s film book ''Keep Watching the Skies'', southern Australia was also considered for a locale, but the producers supposedly decided that audiences \"wouldn't care\" if a monster attacked Australia; its alleged lack of worldwide recognisable landmarks for Gorgo to destroy was also cited as a consideration.\n\nThe location where Gorgo first appears, the fictional Nara Island, is probably a tribute to the Godzilla series; [[Nara period|Nara]] being a historical period of Japan: alternatively, it may be an anagram for the [[Aran Islands]], off Ireland's west coast. The exterior scenes set in Ireland were filmed at [[Bulloch Harbour]] and Coliemore Harbour, both near the County Dublin town of [[Dalkey]]. Other scenes were filmed at the [[MGM-British Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=57549|title=GORGO|publisher=Irish Film & TV Research Online \u2013 Trinity College Dublin|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nScenes where Gorgo is driven through the streets of London were shot on a Sunday morning, when there was no traffic. The film studio wanted Gorgo to fight the military, despite director Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9's objections. Later, Louri\u00e9 acquired a print of the film and removed the footage.{{cn|date=November 2014}}\n\nGorgo's special effects were achieved by suitmation and miniaturization, a technique pioneered in the ''Godzilla'' films. The younger Gorgo was smaller than usual giant monsters so the sets around him were built to a larger scale leading to a greater sense of realism and believability. The creatures were also shot with then-pricey slow-motion cameras to create a sense of scale. The effects were complex and are well respected by special effects artists and fans. The film is also sometimes praised for its innovative ending, which seems to have an environmentalist moral. Unusually for such films, the monsters, which are presented as innocent victims of human interference, survive and prevail.\n\n{{Infobox comic book title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|title                = Gorgo\n|image                = Gorgo issue 4.jpg\n|caption              = Cover to issue #4 of ''Gorgo'' published by [[Charlton Comics]].

Shot in [[Technicolor]], the film is an international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ireland. The plot focuses on Gorgo, a young sea monster brought back to London for exploitation, and Ogra, his even larger mother, who rampages across London to search for him.\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain Joe Ryan is salvaging for treasure off the coast of [[Ireland]], when a volcano erupts, nearly sinking his ship. Ryan and his first officer, Sam Slade, take the ship to Nara Island for repairs. As they enter harbour, they discover the floating carcasses of ancient marine animals, the first hint that something dangerous was awoken by the volcano eruption.\n\nRyan and Slade consult the harbour master, who also has archaeological pretensions: he has been salvaging in the harbour. Some of his men have disappeared mysteriously; it turns out that one has died of fear. After dark, a monstrous creature surfaces, attacks a group of fishermen, then comes ashore to wreak havoc on the island. This dinosaur-like creature is supposedly 65 feet tall. The people of the island finally drive it off.\n\nRyan and his crew manage to capture the monster and haul it aboard their ship, tying it to the deck. Soon, university scientists arrive on Nara, hoping to collect the monster for study, but Ryan has been offered a better deal by the owner of a circus in London. When the ship arrives in London, the circus owner names it \"Gorgo\", after the iconic snake-haired woman, the Gorgon [[Medusa]]. It is exhibited to the public in Battersea Park.\n\nThe scientists examine Gorgo and conclude that he is not yet an adult and that his mother must be at least 200 feet tall. On that note of foreboding, we cut to Nara Island as Ogra, the mother of Gorgo, attacks. Ogra trashes the island, sinks a [[Royal Navy]] vessel and resists attack from other warships. Later, Ogra comes ashore in London, still looking for her son, and goes on a rampage, despite being bombarded by tanks and infantry. Jets attack Ogra, but with no effect. Having demolished much of London, Ogra rescues Gorgo and both mother and son return to the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Travers]] as Captain Joe Ryan\n* [[William Sylvester]] as Sam Slade\n* [[Vincent Winter]] as Sean\n* [[Christopher Rhodes]] as McCartin\n* [[Joseph O'Conor]] as Professor Hendricks\n* [[Bruce Seton]] as Professor Flaherty\n* [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Dorkin\n* [[Basil Dignam]] as Admiral Brooks\n* Mick Dillon as Gorgo / Ogra\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally intended to be set in [[Japan]] as an homage to [[Godzilla]]; the setting was then changed to [[France]], and then finally changed to the [[British Isles]]. According to [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]]'s film book ''Keep Watching the Skies'', southern Australia was also considered for a locale, but the producers supposedly decided that audiences \"wouldn't care\" if a monster attacked Australia; its alleged lack of worldwide recognisable landmarks for Gorgo to destroy was also cited as a consideration.\n\nThe location where Gorgo first appears, the fictional Nara Island, is probably a tribute to the Godzilla series; [[Nara period|Nara]] being a historical period of Japan: alternatively, it may be an anagram for the [[Aran Islands]], off Ireland's west coast. The exterior scenes set in Ireland were filmed at [[Bulloch Harbour]] and Coliemore Harbour, both near the County Dublin town of [[Dalkey]]. Other scenes were filmed at the [[MGM-British Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=57549|title=GORGO|publisher=Irish Film & TV Research Online \u2013 Trinity College Dublin|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nScenes where Gorgo is driven through the streets of London were shot on a Sunday morning, when there was no traffic. The film studio wanted Gorgo to fight the military, despite director Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9's objections. Later, Louri\u00e9 acquired a print of the film and removed the footage.{{cn|date=November 2014}}\n\nGorgo's special effects were achieved by suitmation and miniaturization, a technique pioneered in the ''Godzilla'' films. The younger Gorgo was smaller than usual giant monsters so the sets around him were built to a larger scale leading to a greater sense of realism and believability. The creatures were also shot with then-pricey slow-motion cameras to create a sense of scale. The effects were complex and are well respected by special effects artists and fans. The film is also sometimes praised for its innovative ending, which seems to have an environmentalist moral. Unusually for such films, the monsters, which are presented as innocent victims of human interference, survive and prevail.\n\n{{Infobox comic book title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|title                = Gorgo\n|image                = Gorgo issue 4.jpg\n|caption              = Cover to issue #4 of ''Gorgo'' published by [[Charlton Comics]].
