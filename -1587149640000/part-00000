It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Brooke Boen |publisher=NASA |title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029061057/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |archivedate=29 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine |journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine |first1=Sishir |last1=Rao |first2=Lodewijk |last2=van Holsbeeck |first3=Joseph L. |last3=Musial |first4=Alton |last4=Parker |first5=J.

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact.

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact.

Jackie Leyland, framed her client Daphne Rivas for theft; after being pressured by the police chief not to charge Leyland, Judge Carmichael instead forces both the defense and the prosecution to submit new evidence that contradicts the officer's testimony, allowing Rivas to go free; she then warns Leyland never to lie in her courtroom again. DDA Mark Callan is set to try a man accused of robbery who insists on representing himself and uses the opportunity to cross-examine Mark, revealing that his father Victor Callan is a known grifter and criminal. Through a clever trick, however, Mark convinces the jury that his opponent is guilty. Emily meets Luke, a bailiff training to be a lawyer, but having already been through an abusive relationship, she decides she's not ready for a new one with him. Lola tells Daphne that she knows her mother was the real culprit and made her take the fall by threatening to abandon her and her unborn baby; she encourages her to leave and start her own life. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Long Day's Journey into ICE\n |DirectedBy      = Michael M.

Mark discovers that the father of a young woman he's prosecuting paid a witness to lie on the stand, which puts him into conflict with defense attorney Amy Quinn. Realizing this, Lola points out that Mark always had \u201ca thing\u201d for Amy, annoying him. Aware of the pressure of having to protect a criminally inclined parent, he persuades the girl to testify against her father, getting him sentenced to two years with the help of his superior, DA Thomas Choi. Emily prepares to enter a guilty plea on her client's behalf that would result in a four-year sentence and strip him of his right to asylum, but Lola refuses to accept it. Instead, she finds a loophole that allows the defendant to instead be charged with a misdemeanor, ensuring that he will only have to serve three months and protecting him from deportation. Later that night, Mark gives Lola a housewarming gift: a framed photo of her childhood hero, [[Nyota Uhura]].\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Sweet Bird of Truth\n |DirectedBy      = [[Anthony Hemingway]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Sunil Nayar]] & Iturri Sosa\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|7}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22103\n |Viewers         = 5.27<ref name=\"1.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-october-7-2019/|title='9-1-1' adjusts up, 'Bluff City Law' adjusts down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2019|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = An unusual case is presented to Lola: a gamer, Janny Cartwright, accusing her friend of hacking into the popular online game ''Skyrise'' and \"murdering\" her avatar Errk. To facilitate her testimony, Lola allows Cartwright to testify while in character as Errk, leading to the prosecution threatening to file a complaint against her for incompetence. Recognizing that the case is civil, not criminal, in nature, Lola persuades both sides to agree to a settlement, in which no jail time will be served. Against Choi's wishes, Mark chooses to file charges in a racially-charged incident for which there is no clear proof and the victim refuses to testify. Faced with near-certain defeat, he wins only by submitting evidence proving that the man intended to commit violence. While jogging to work, Luke is mistaken for a vandal and arrested by one of his fellow deputies, Murphy, who eventually lets him go free but refuses to admit his mistake. At an evening gala to receive a medal for heroic actions, Luke confronts Murphy in uniform and tells him off before the ceremony.

The trip initially goes well, but when police report an active shooter in the area, the court is forced to take shelter. This causes Lola to fear that her decision will lead to a biased verdict, and she insists on personally meeting with each of the jurors individually before deciding whom to strike. Mark is prosecuting a powerful [[heroin]] kingpin; his entire case is based on video footage provided by Det. Leyland. Warned by Lola, Mark takes a closer look at Leyland's evidence and quickly realizes that the warrant she used to obtain it was based on a CI's false testimony. Despite his misgivings about challenging the police, he informs Choi, who calls in the police chief and gets him to have Leyland investigated. Mark is forced to dismiss the charges, but Choi congratulates him, noting that the business of prosecutors is to get justice, not convictions. In spite of Lola's fears, the jury finds Dylan not guilty.

Lola is stunned to learn that her latest defendant will be charged hefty court fees, so she works out a plan for him to serve a few hours in jail instead. Emily's client, a [[Catholic]] nun ([[Emma Dumont]]), falsely confesses to stealing from her church; Emily determines that she did so in order to protect her mentor, the church's accountant, who stole the money in a dispute over how it was to be spent. Emily arranges for the stolen funds to be returned, and Lola sentences her client to community service. Mark is prosecuting a woman who is a serial dine-and-dasher. Amy Quinn is her lawyer and beats Mark in court by using dirty tactics. Amy surprises him afterwards by informing her guilty client that she will not be representing her in the future. They agree to have dinner together when possible. Luke helps Emily remove her engagement ring so she can return it to her former mother-in-law.

Emily tries to get Mark to sign off on a more favorable deal to her client, who belongs to a family of criminals; after a difficult conversation about how they both know what it's like to have family issues, Mark agrees. After being forced to stay with Sherri for the night when her home address is posted online, Lola has had enough and orders a formal complaint written up against Pryce, threatening him with potential [[disbarment]] to keep him in line. Choi then delivers a powerful cross-examination of the defendant, forcing her to incriminate herself and sealing her fate. Lola is disgusted to find that Pryce doesn't even care that he lost, only that he was outmaneuvered. While helping Luke prepare for his exams, Emily gives into her feelings and kisses him.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Uncommon Women and Mothers\n |DirectedBy      = Paul McCrane \n |WrittenBy       = Sunil Nayar\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|4}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22107\n |Viewers         = 5.11<ref name=\"1.07\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-4-2019/|title='Dancing with the Stars' and 'The Good Doctor' adjust down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 5, 2019|accessdate=November 5, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = A minor earthquake strikes the courthouse. Lola discovers her social activist mother, Roxy, is testifying on behalf of Jax, a [[non binary]] homeless youth who uses they/them pronouns and is accused of [[arson]]. Mark is prosecuting the case and hammers Roxy with questions implying Jax's guilt, leading to Roxy being found in contempt of court for refusing to answer. Only when Lola tells Roxy to have faith in the system does she agree to finish her testimony. Emily tells Luke that while she kissed him, she does not want to pursue their relationship any further for now. Sherri and Sara compete with each other for the chance to be named the building's new earthquake safety warden. Lola refuses to sign off on a warrant over [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] concerns, but Benner overrules her and signs it; Lola angrily confronts her but recognizes that she doesn't have the same experience and foresight as her mentor. Jax is found guilty, but only on a minor charge with no prison time. Encouraged by Roxy, Mark has a drink with his father. Luke tells Emily that she needs to decide what she wants.

After beating a judge in a game of [[pai gow]], Mark gets the witness released and brings him back in time to testify. Lola's latest defendant, Felix Flores, is accused of murdering his wife Linda despite no body having been found. Among the witnesses is his eleven-year old daughter Maricela, who's unwillingness to put her father in prison results in Emily and Lola crossing swords as the latter goes above and beyond to avoid breaking up their family. Following state guidelines, Lola modifies her courtroom to make Maricela comfortable so she can testify. Emily spots an inconsistency in the testimony of another witness, Linda's best friend, and has the police look into it. A search of the witness' house reveals the truth: Linda, a recovering addict, had an overdose and was buried by her friend in secret to hide her own habit. Felix and Maricela are reunited, and Emily goes to apologize to Lola, who is annoyed by her lack of respect but concurs she would have done the same as a lawyer. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = How to Succeed in Law Without Really Re-trying\n |DirectedBy      = [[Cheryl Dunye]]\n |WrittenBy       = Gregory Nelson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|25}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22109\n |Viewers         = 5.12<ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-25-2019/|title='9-1-1' adjusts up, 'The Voice' and 'Bluff City Law' adjusts down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 26, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola's old nemesis, Felice Bell ([[Ever Carradine]]), announces she is appealing one of Lola's biggest cases while she was at the district attorney's office: putting an [[Alt-right|alt-right]] sympathizer in jail for a bombing that killed a young woman. As Mark's case for the appeal begins to fall apart due to gaps in the evidence, and Lola confronts Felice about intimidating her, she begins to wonder if she put an innocent man behind bars. However, Mark is able to convince one of the original witnesses to bring forward new evidence, leading to the appeal being curbed. Emily defends a former prisoner accused of conspiring to kill the judge who sentenced him.

The courtroom is shut down for an [[asbestos]] check, so Lola, Sara, and Luke are transferred to a different room to try Carissa Shaw, who is facing a potential [[three-strikes law|third strike]] for a stickup. Lola becomes concerned that the defendant's attorney, Fisk, is too inexperienced to handle the defense and removes him; Emily is appointed in his place even though Carissa blames her for mishandling her defense when she was first charged. Mark witnesses his father being arrested and learns he is being charged with murder.

Liam refuses to explain why until Mark forces him to, revealing that it was Mabbit's [[heroin]] that killed his sister.

He asks her if she would like to date and she says yes, so they start dating for real.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |Title           = My Fair Lockdown\n |DirectedBy      = David Harp\n |WrittenBy       = Conway Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|17}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22116\n |Viewers         = 5.37<ref name=\"1.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-17-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.17.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 19, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The courthouse goes into lockdown when a defendant, Ephraim Bowles, steals a bailiff's gun and takes Lola, Choi, Emily, and the jury hostage. Mark and Luke are forced to shelter in place with Judge Laski after Luke violates court rules by speaking out of turn, earning a reprimand. Mark correctly deduces that Luke's outburst is tied to his feeling that he and Emily are drifting apart; Laski advises Luke to either start listening to Emily or end things. Lola convinces Bowles to release the jury members, but he then threatens to shoot Choi; Emily intervenes to save him by using Choi's family to guilt Bowles into sparing him. Judge Benner is locked in her office with Jean Frost, an old acquaintance who had previously spoken with Lola about her case. Frost tears into Benner, accusing her of being heartless, to which Benner confesses that she leaked documents her firm tried to hide, an offense that could get her disbarred. Ephraim contemplates suicide before his estranged daughter sends a video message urging him to surrender, which he does. Everyone is reunited with their loved ones, and Lola catches Benner and Frost embracing each other.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 17\n |Title           = I Love You, You're Perfect, I Think\n |DirectedBy      = Paul McCrane\n |WrittenBy       = Gregory Nelson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|9}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22117\n |Viewers         = 4.62<ref name=\"1.17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-9-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.9.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola presents her findings to Judge Benner, which leads to an argument as Benner insists that an ethical violation is nothing compared to all the good work she intends to do as Attorney General. Mark makes an unexpected discovery: a burglary suspect may be responsible for a murder he prosecuted eight years ago in which an innocent man was convicted. He ignores Choi's orders to turn the case over to the Conviction Review Unit and has the man arrested, and Choi angrily suspends him. Emily finds herself hastily assigned to several new cases, including that of a veteran who she deduces is suffering from untreated [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Her motion to have the charges dropped is denied by Lola, who asks instead for a deal in which her client will receive treatment while serving a one-year sentence. The experience brings her and Luke (sitting second chair in the trial) closer together than they've been in weeks. Sara forces Judge Campbell to acknowledge a mistake he made and wins his respect for standing up for herself. Judge Benner tells Lola she was wrong for challenging her, and will drop out of the race immediately.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 18\n |Title           = The Tale of Three Arraignments\n |DirectedBy      = Claudia Yarmy\n |WrittenBy       = Denitria Harris-Lawrence\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22118\n |Viewers         = 5.80<ref name=\"1.18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola is selected by Judge Benner to handle [[arraignment]]s for the day, while Mark is penalized for his conduct with an assignment in the Case Review Unit. Lola runs into her old classmate Rachel, who is opening her own firm and wants to take Lola and Mark on as partners. Emily determines that her client Pamela, a prostitute, is being made to take the fall for her pimp. She and DDA Palmer have him arrested and cut a deal with his lawyer, Rachel, to get him to flip on his boss. Emily also gets Pamela help starting a new life. Robin suddenly returns home with news that he may be getting a job in L.A., to his wife's surprise. Mark contemplates the benefits of joining a private firm, but decides that he can put the decision off while he resumes his normal job. Amy, however, accepts Rachel's offer. Luke questions whether Emily truly loves him, and she explains that her failed marriage has warped her understanding of what love is. Luke tells her they'll find a way to work past that.

Jackie Leyland, framed her client Daphne Rivas for theft; after being pressured by the police chief not to charge Leyland, Judge Carmichael instead forces both the defense and the prosecution to submit new evidence that contradicts the officer's testimony, allowing Rivas to go free; she then warns Leyland never to lie in her courtroom again. DDA Mark Callan is set to try a man accused of robbery who insists on representing himself and uses the opportunity to cross-examine Mark, revealing that his father Victor Callan is a known grifter and criminal. Through a clever trick, however, Mark convinces the jury that his opponent is guilty. Emily meets Luke, a bailiff training to be a lawyer, but having already been through an abusive relationship, she decides she's not ready for a new one with him. Lola tells Daphne that she knows her mother was the real culprit and made her take the fall by threatening to abandon her and her unborn baby; she encourages her to leave and start her own life. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Long Day's Journey into ICE\n |DirectedBy      = Michael M.

Mark discovers that the father of a young woman he's prosecuting paid a witness to lie on the stand, which puts him into conflict with defense attorney Amy Quinn. Realizing this, Lola points out that Mark always had \u201ca thing\u201d for Amy, annoying him. Aware of the pressure of having to protect a criminally inclined parent, he persuades the girl to testify against her father, getting him sentenced to two years with the help of his superior, DA Thomas Choi. Emily prepares to enter a guilty plea on her client's behalf that would result in a four-year sentence and strip him of his right to asylum, but Lola refuses to accept it. Instead, she finds a loophole that allows the defendant to instead be charged with a misdemeanor, ensuring that he will only have to serve three months and protecting him from deportation.

To facilitate her testimony, Lola allows Cartwright to testify while in character as Errk, leading to the prosecution threatening to file a complaint against her for incompetence. Recognizing that the case is civil, not criminal, in nature, Lola persuades both sides to agree to a settlement, in which no jail time will be served. Against Choi's wishes, Mark chooses to file charges in a racially-charged incident for which there is no clear proof and the victim refuses to testify. Faced with near-certain defeat, he wins only by submitting evidence proving that the man intended to commit violence. While jogging to work, Luke is mistaken for a vandal and arrested by one of his fellow deputies, Murphy, who eventually lets him go free but refuses to admit his mistake.

The trip initially goes well, but when police report an active shooter in the area, the court is forced to take shelter. This causes Lola to fear that her decision will lead to a biased verdict, and she insists on personally meeting with each of the jurors individually before deciding whom to strike. Mark is prosecuting a powerful [[heroin]] kingpin; his entire case is based on video footage provided by Det. Leyland. Warned by Lola, Mark takes a closer look at Leyland's evidence and quickly realizes that the warrant she used to obtain it was based on a CI's false testimony. Despite his misgivings about challenging the police, he informs Choi, who calls in the police chief and gets him to have Leyland investigated. Mark is forced to dismiss the charges, but Choi congratulates him, noting that the business of prosecutors is to get justice, not convictions. In spite of Lola's fears, the jury finds Dylan not guilty.

Emily's client, a [[Catholic]] nun ([[Emma Dumont]]), falsely confesses to stealing from her church; Emily determines that she did so in order to protect her mentor, the church's accountant, who stole the money in a dispute over how it was to be spent. Emily arranges for the stolen funds to be returned, and Lola sentences her client to community service. Mark is prosecuting a woman who is a serial dine-and-dasher. Amy Quinn is her lawyer and beats Mark in court by using dirty tactics. Amy surprises him afterwards by informing her guilty client that she will not be representing her in the future. They agree to have dinner together when possible. Luke helps Emily remove her engagement ring so she can return it to her former mother-in-law. Judge Benner arrives to officiate the weddings, despite confiding to Lola that her partner dumped her earlier that day.   \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Fool for Liv \n |DirectedBy      = Stacey K.

Emily tries to get Mark to sign off on a more favorable deal to her client, who belongs to a family of criminals; after a difficult conversation about how they both know what it's like to have family issues, Mark agrees. After being forced to stay with Sherri for the night when her home address is posted online, Lola has had enough and orders a formal complaint written up against Pryce, threatening him with potential [[disbarment]] to keep him in line. Choi then delivers a powerful cross-examination of the defendant, forcing her to incriminate herself and sealing her fate. Lola is disgusted to find that Pryce doesn't even care that he lost, only that he was outmaneuvered.

Lola's latest defendant, Felix Flores, is accused of murdering his wife Linda despite no body having been found. Among the witnesses is his eleven-year old daughter Maricela, who's unwillingness to put her father in prison results in Emily and Lola crossing swords as the latter goes above and beyond to avoid breaking up their family. Following state guidelines, Lola modifies her courtroom to make Maricela comfortable so she can testify. Emily spots an inconsistency in the testimony of another witness, Linda's best friend, and has the police look into it. A search of the witness' house reveals the truth: Linda, a recovering addict, had an overdose and was buried by her friend in secret to hide her own habit. Felix and Maricela are reunited, and Emily goes to apologize to Lola, who is annoyed by her lack of respect but concurs she would have done the same as a lawyer. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = How to Succeed in Law Without Really Re-trying\n |DirectedBy      = [[Cheryl Dunye]]\n |WrittenBy       = Gregory Nelson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|25}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22109\n |Viewers         = 5.12<ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-25-2019/|title='9-1-1' adjusts up, 'The Voice' and 'Bluff City Law' adjusts down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 26, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola's old nemesis, Felice Bell ([[Ever Carradine]]), announces she is appealing one of Lola's biggest cases while she was at the district attorney's office: putting an [[Alt-right|alt-right]] sympathizer in jail for a bombing that killed a young woman. As Mark's case for the appeal begins to fall apart due to gaps in the evidence, and Lola confronts Felice about intimidating her, she begins to wonder if she put an innocent man behind bars. However, Mark is able to convince one of the original witnesses to bring forward new evidence, leading to the appeal being curbed.

Lola becomes concerned that the defendant's attorney, Fisk, is too inexperienced to handle the defense and removes him; Emily is appointed in his place even though Carissa blames her for mishandling her defense when she was first charged.

Liam refuses to explain why until Mark forces him to, revealing that it was Mabbit's [[heroin]] that killed his sister.

Dreyfus, the direction of the CGT is slowly evolving, since the 1990s, during which it cut all organic links with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), in favour of a more moderate stance. The CGT is concentrating its attention, in particular since the [[1995 general strikes in France|1995 general strikes]], to trade-unionism in the private sector.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\n==History==\n=== 1895 to 1947===\n==== 1895: Creation ====\n\nThe CGT was founded in 1895 in [[Limoges]] from the merger of the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des bourses du travail]]'' (Federation of Labour Councils) and the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des syndicats]]'' (National Federation of Trade Unions). [[Auguste Keufer]] was amongst the founders and became the first treasurer.<ref name=\"BNF\">{{cite web|title=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb100264709|website=catalogue.bnf.fr|publisher=Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==== 1895\u20131914: Anarcho-syndicalism ====\n\nUp until 1919 the CGT was dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]] tendencies, with [[\u00c9mile Pouget]] as vice-secretary and leader of the union from 1906 to 1909. The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers. Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party. It has succeeded in remaining one of the two major French union confederations, while the Communist Party has declined severely.\n\n=== From the 1995 general strike to today ===\n\nIt was the leading trade-union in the [[1995 strikes in France|1995 general strike]] against [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]]'s plan of Welfare State reforms (in particular concerning pensions).\n\nThe CGT also protested against [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]]'s project of pensions reforms in 2003.\n\nIn February 2005, the National Confederate Committee (CCN), the \"Parliament\" of the trade-union, rejected national secretary [[Bernard Thibault]]'s support of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE).\n\nTherefore, the CGT actively supported the \"NO\" during the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|2005 referendum on the TCE]], criticizing its [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] orientation and weaknesses concerning the few democratic measures about the working of the [[European Union]] (EU) institutions.\n\nIn autumn 2005, the [[Marseille]]se section of the CGT, representing the more radical faction opposed to Bernard Thibault's more centrist views, demonstrated against the privatization of the [[SNCM]] ship company.\nThe CGT then supported the student movement during the [[2006 labour protests in France|2006 protests against]] the ''[[Contrat premi\u00e8re embauche]]'' (CPE, First Employment Contract).\n\nIt supported the movement against the [[El Khomri law]] on labor in spring 2016.\n\nThe CGT left the Communist-oriented [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] at its 1995 congress and became a member of the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] in 1999. It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar.

Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 24, 27</ref>\n\nWithin the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''. Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nIn Togo, CGT had 45,100 members in 1948 (65% of organized labour). By 1952 the number had decreased to 34,000 (46% of organized labour).<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''.

Dreyfus, the direction of the CGT is slowly evolving, since the 1990s, during which it cut all organic links with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), in favour of a more moderate stance. The CGT is concentrating its attention, in particular since the [[1995 general strikes in France|1995 general strikes]], to trade-unionism in the private sector.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\n==History==\n=== 1895 to 1947===\n==== 1895: Creation ====\n\nThe CGT was founded in 1895 in [[Limoges]] from the merger of the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des bourses du travail]]'' (Federation of Labour Councils) and the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des syndicats]]'' (National Federation of Trade Unions). [[Auguste Keufer]] was amongst the founders and became the first treasurer.<ref name=\"BNF\">{{cite web|title=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb100264709|website=catalogue.bnf.fr|publisher=Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==== 1895\u20131914: Anarcho-syndicalism ====\n\nUp until 1919 the CGT was dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]] tendencies, with [[\u00c9mile Pouget]] as vice-secretary and leader of the union from 1906 to 1909. The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers. Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party. It has succeeded in remaining one of the two major French union confederations, while the Communist Party has declined severely.\n\n=== From the 1995 general strike to today ===\n\nIt was the leading trade-union in the [[1995 strikes in France|1995 general strike]] against [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]]'s plan of Welfare State reforms (in particular concerning pensions).\n\nThe CGT also protested against [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]]'s project of pensions reforms in 2003.\n\nIn February 2005, the National Confederate Committee (CCN), the \"Parliament\" of the trade-union, rejected national secretary [[Bernard Thibault]]'s support of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE).\n\nTherefore, the CGT actively supported the \"NO\" during the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|2005 referendum on the TCE]], criticizing its [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] orientation and weaknesses concerning the few democratic measures about the working of the [[European Union]] (EU) institutions.\n\nIn autumn 2005, the [[Marseille]]se section of the CGT, representing the more radical faction opposed to Bernard Thibault's more centrist views, demonstrated against the privatization of the [[SNCM]] ship company.\nThe CGT then supported the student movement during the [[2006 labour protests in France|2006 protests against]] the ''[[Contrat premi\u00e8re embauche]]'' (CPE, First Employment Contract).\n\nIt supported the movement against the [[El Khomri law]] on labor in spring 2016.\n\nThe CGT left the Communist-oriented [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] at its 1995 congress and became a member of the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] in 1999. It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar.

Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 24, 27</ref>\n\nWithin the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''. Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nIn Togo, CGT had 45,100 members in 1948 (65% of organized labour). By 1952 the number had decreased to 34,000 (46% of organized labour).<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''.

Typically HITRAN includes absorption cross-sections for heavy polyatomic molecules (with low-lying vibrational modes) which are difficult for detailed analysis due to the high density of the spectral bands/lines, broadening effects, isomerization, and overall modeling complexity.<ref name=\"hitran2016\" /> There are 327 molecular species provided as cross-section files.

HAPI extends the functionality of the main site, in particular, for the calculation of spectra using several types of line shape calculations, including the flexible HT (Hartmann-Tran) profile. This HT line shape can also be reduced to a number of conventional line profiles such as Gaussian (Doppler), Lorentzian, Voigt, Rautian, Speed-dependent Voigt and speed-dependent Rautian. In addition to accounting for pressure, temperature and optical path length, the user can include a number of instrumental functions to simulate experimental spectra. HAPI is able to account for broadening of lines due to mixtures of gases, making use of all broadening parameters supplied by HITRAN.

Typically HITRAN includes absorption cross-sections for heavy polyatomic molecules (with low-lying vibrational modes) which are difficult for detailed analysis due to the high density of the spectral bands/lines, broadening effects, isomerization, and overall modeling complexity.<ref name=\"hitran2016\" /> There are 327 molecular species provided as cross-section files. The cross-section files are provided in the HITRAN format described on the official HITRAN website (http://hitran.org/docs/cross-sections-definitions/).\n\nA Python library [http://hitran.org/hapi HAPI] (HITRAN Application Programming Interface) has been developed which serves as a tool for absorption and transmission calculations as well as comparisons of spectroscopic data sets. HAPI extends the functionality of the main site, in particular, for the calculation of spectra using several types of line shape calculations, including the flexible HT (Hartmann-Tran) profile. This HT line shape can also be reduced to a number of conventional line profiles such as Gaussian (Doppler), Lorentzian, Voigt, Rautian, Speed-dependent Voigt and speed-dependent Rautian. In addition to accounting for pressure, temperature and optical path length, the user can include a number of instrumental functions to simulate experimental spectra. HAPI is able to account for broadening of lines due to mixtures of gases, making use of all broadening parameters supplied by HITRAN.

The company also built and raced a series of small displacement endurance racing cars. After a series of mergers and acquisitions the Monopole name was retired in Europe, but survives in Africa in the name of a former licensee.\n\n== History ==\n\"\u00c9tablissements SIM SA was a company based in Morge, Switzerland that operated a foundry and machine shops. In 1920 they used American investment capital to start another company called \u00c9tablissements Monopole in [[Poissy]] on the outskirts of Paris, France.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/><ref name=\"ceha\"/> The new company specialised in producing pistons, piston-rings, valves, and other parts for automobile engines, and was managed by a Mr. Guerne.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/> The company's name is abbreviated Ets. Monopole, but \"Monopole-Poissy\" was used in the company's own literature.<ref name=\"ceha\"/>\n\nIn 1937\u201338, majority ownership of Monopole was acquired by Andr\u00e9 H\u00e9mard, son of Guy-Aristide H\u00e9mard of the H\u00e9mard distilling concern that merged his Pernod Fils company with Les \u00c9tablissements Pernod P\u00e8re et Fils to form Les \u00c9tablissements Pernod \u2014 Maisons Pernod Fils.\n\nIn 1944 H\u00e9mard installed his son-in-law Jean de Montr\u00e9my, until then working for aeronautical parts manufacturer Bronze-Avia, as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Monopole, whose clients by then included Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> H\u00e9mard's son [[Jean H\u00e9mard|Jean]] served as production director.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> His other son  {{Interlanguage link|Pierre H\u00e9mard|de|lt=Pierre}} also worked for the company.\n\nA merger with the Floquet sparkplug company resulted in a name change to ''Floquet Monopole''. Several other companies were later absorbed, including valve maker Jeudy, gudgeon pin maker Marty, and piston maker Nova.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/>\n\nOn 1 July 1963, the Perfect Circle Corporation of Hagerstown, Indiana, a maker of piston rings, became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Dana Incorporated]] of Toledo, Ohio.<ref name=\"waynet\"/> In 1978 Dana completed the acquisition of Floquet Monopole.<ref name=\"ft-aug1979\"/>\n\nAs late as the end of October 1995 the Floquet Monopole name remained in use in Europe, but by the beginning of 1998 it had been phased out, and the division was known as Perfect Circle.<ref name=\"uspto-1999\"/><ref name=\"cisg-case\"/> A former Floquet Monopole licensee purchased the rights to the name from Dana, incorporating as Floquet Monopole Industrie de Pr\u00e9cision in Fes, Morocco.<ref name=\"econ-jul2019\"/> Dana announced completion of the sale of the balance of its European parts divisions to [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle]] on 9 March 2007.<ref name=\"dana-mahle\"/>\n\n==Monopole in racing==\n[[File:1956 Monopole-Panhard X86.jpg|thumb|A 1956 Monopole X86 berlinette.]]\n[[File:1956 Panhard-Monopole X86.jpg|thumb|Monopole X86 rear three-quarter view.]]\nWhile a student at [[Reims]], de Montr\u00e9my spent time at Circuit [[Reims-Gueux]], where he developed a taste for racing. As CEO of Monopole, he recognised the value of competition as a way to both test Monopole's products and promote the company. Efforts were focused on the small-displacement classes in endurance racing as conditions closest to what the parts would experience in normal road use.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> \u00c9curie Monopole was established to take the company racing.\n\nde Montr\u00e9my designed the first racing Monopole himself. This car used the chassis and engine of a [[Simca 8]], but clothed them in lightweight aluminium bodywork. Its debut race was at the Formula Libre Voiturette 2.0+1.1s at Reims on 6 July 1947, where the car finished seventh.<ref name=\"rsc-monopole-arch\"/> In 1948 two more Simca-Monopoles were built that used the Simca 8's engine, but these successors substituted custom-built lightweight chassis for the Simca original.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> These cars were raced throughout 1948 and 1949, including the first appearance of a Monopole at Le Mans, where the car driven by de Montr\u00e9my and {{Interlanguage link|Eug\u00e8ne Dussous|de|lt=Eug\u00e8ne Dussous}} finished twelfth overall and first in the S 1.1 class.\n\nRacing the Monopoles was to some extent a family affair, with de Montr\u00e9my and his brothers-in-law Jean and Pierre H\u00e9mard making many appearances in the cars, including at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1950, 1951, and 1953. Other Monopole racing drivers included brothers {{Interlanguage link|Pierre Chancel|de|lt=Pierre}} and {{Interlanguage link|Robert Chancel|de|lt=Robert Chancel}}, {{Interlanguage link|Pierre Flahault|de|lt=Pierre Flahault}}, [[Yvonne Simon]], and [[Jean Vinatier]].\n\nIn 1950 Panhard increased their involvement in racing, but indirectly, by offering parts and technical support to different racing teams. Monopole availed themselves of this to design a new racing car that used Panhard's air-cooled flat twin engine designed by [[Louis Delagarde]]. The car also used the [[front-wheel drive]] chassis of the [[Panhard Dyna X]], suitably modified.<ref name=\"spiritracer\"/><ref name=\"prt-3721\"/> The car was designed by Monopole's Pierre Bourdereau, who produced a very compact barquette, although due to its full-width [[Ponton (car)|ponton]]-style bodywork the car is often referred to as a ''tank'', as are some other Monopoles. The naming convention for Monopole's Panhard-based racing cars followed that used for the various Dyna X models.\n\nIn 1952 Monopole won both the Index of Performance and the eighteenth Biennial Cup for the third year in a row, making them the only manufacturer to achieve three such consecutive victories.\n\nIn 1953 Panhard decided to become directly involved in racing. Paul Panhard established a racing team under director Etienne de Valance.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> With the help of designer [[Marcel Riffard]] and later Pierre Durand, Panhard produced three models for their own racing efforts; the X88, X89 and VM5. As there were no corresponding Dyna X series X88 or X89, these designations were specific to the racing cars built by Panhard.\n\nIn 1956, following the accident at Le Mans in 1955, Panhard withdrew from direct racing involvement. \u00c9curie Monopole became Panhard's officially supported racing team. Staff as well as Panhard's racing cars were transferred to \u00c9curie Monopole at their location at Ach\u00e8res.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/><ref name=\"reissorg\"/> Personnel for the team numbered just eight.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> Some entrant lists record the team as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Monopole Course rather than \u00c9curie Monopole.\n\nThe team increasingly tried to pursue GT events due to the shortage of sportscar events being run. At the end of the 1958 season the decision was made to close \u00c9curie Monopole.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/>\n\n==Racing cars==\nList of Monopole racing models:\n\n'''Monopole Sport'''\n* The first Monopole racer used both the {{convert|1090|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} inline four-cylinder engine and chassis of a [[Simca 8]], but with lightweight aluminium bodywork. In 1948 two additional copies were built that kept the Simca engine but used a custom chassis designed and built by Monopole. The car debuted at Reims in 1947, and won its class at Le Mans in 1949.\n\n'''Duval Monopole'''\n* This car, chassis DS 002, began to appear on tracks around 1951. It seems to have been one of the earlier Simca Monopole cars that had been modified by owner/driver Pierre Duval to accept a 2.0&nbsp;L V8 engine from a [[Ford Vedette]].<ref name=\"f2reg-1951\"/> Ford sold the Vedette model and the Poissy factory where it and the [[Ford Flathead V8 engine|flathead engine]] powering it were built to Simca in 1954.\n\n'''Monopole X84'''\n* Beginning with this model, Monopole based their racing cars on the [[Panhard Dyna X]] and its series numbers, using the donor's engine, chassis and running gear but with streamlined custom bodywork. The body style was a barquette, but was referred to as a ''tank''. Panhard's X84 series was the basis of the Dyna 100, and came with a GM600 S engine that displaced {{cvt|610|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} and developed {{cvt|22|CV|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm in standard tune. The Monopole X84 first appeared at Le Mans in 1950, where the number 52 car driven by de Montr\u00e9my and H\u00e9mard finished twenty-second overall. This model continued to appear at various races, including Le Mans, for several years after.\n\n'''Monopole X85'''\n* X85 was the series number for the Dyna 110. Engine displacement was the same as in the X84, but the GM600 SS2 engine developed {{cvt|28|CV|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm in factory tune. A Monopole X85 barquette with number 60 appeared at the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans]] driven by H\u00e9mard and de Montr\u00e9my.<ref name=\"lmh-eq1953\"/>\n\n'''Monopole X86'''\n* When Monopole upgraded to the X86 series from the Dyna 120, engine displacement grew to {{cvt|745|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} and was available in two levels of tune from the factory; the GM750 SS3 engine which developed {{cvt|32.6|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000, or the GM750 Sprint engine which developed {{cvt|33.5|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm. Monopole X86 cars appeared at Le Mans in 1955, then again in 1957 and 1958. Both barquette and berlinette versions of the X86 were built.\n\n'''Monopole X87'''\n* The X87 series embodied by the Dyna 130 received an engine of {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}}. Power from the standard GM 850 S engine was {{cvt|38|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm, while the Sprint engine produced {{cvt|42|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm. The Monopole X87 appeared at Le Mans in 1953.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole X88'''\n* Originally built by Panhard and with no Dyna X model sharing its series number, the X88 was a unique design just for racing. The original 1953 Le Mans barquette bodywork by Riffard was wide and low, with a flat tapering tail. Panhard used a chassis of light alloy, and added bodywork of duralinox.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> The passenger compartment was faired in except for an opening for the driver, with a raised headrest as part of the bodywork behind his seat. At the front, the leading edges of the fenders projected forward, and were capped by conspicuous forward-facing conical covers. The first X88 was powered by a {{cvt|610|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} Panhard twin. The body of the X88 would be revised more than once, first to a more traditional sportscar style with exposed headlamps, then to a smooth curving nose with covered lamps.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole X89'''\n* As with the X88, the X89 was a racing-specific model first built by Panhard. The original bodywork for the 1953 Le Mans car was similar in appearance to that of the X88 and was also of duralinox. The X89, however, was powered by the larger {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} Panhard twin. As with the X88, the X89's body would later be revised, with at least one car being bodied as a closed berlinette with a smooth curving nose.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole VM5'''\n*  In spring 1955 Panhard built two new cars designed by engineer Pierre Durand for the upcoming Le Mans race. Named VM5s, these barquettes were powered by {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} flat-twins mounted in tubular chassis with fully independent suspension.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> The cars had a central seat and bodywork that was streamlined and very low; lower even than the X88 and X89 designed by Riffard.<ref name=\"prt-3647\"/> Panhard's VM5s appeared at Le Mans in 1955, as did two X88s newly built by Monopole.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> One VM5, chassis 868 CA75, was raced at La Sarthe again in 1958 as a Monopole.<ref name=\"rsc-868_CA75\"/>\n\n'''Monopole-Oliveira Formula Junior'''\n* In late 1958 Monopole technician and racing mechanic Jos\u00e9 Carvallo de Oliveira asked de Montr\u00e9my for permission to build an open-wheeled [[Formula Junior]] car.<ref name=\"oliveira\"/> The new car used the same front-mounted, front-wheel drive flat-twin engine and suspension as the Monopole sportscars. The Monopole-Oliveira was raced in 1959 and 1960, then put into storage. Oliveira died in 2004, and his son sold the car in 2007. The fully restored car appeared at Brands Hatch in June 2008.\n\n== Racing record ==\n'''Reims Formula Libre'''\n* 1947 \u2014 Simca Monopole Sport driven by de Montr\u00e9my to a seventh-place finish.\n\n'''12 Hours of Paris'''\n* 1948 \u2014 Ninth place finish and class win in S 1.1 by de Montr\u00e9my and Dussous.

The company also built and raced a series of small displacement endurance racing cars. After a series of mergers and acquisitions the Monopole name was retired in Europe, but survives in Africa in the name of a former licensee.\n\n== History ==\n\"\u00c9tablissements SIM SA was a company based in Morge, Switzerland that operated a foundry and machine shops. In 1920 they used American investment capital to start another company called \u00c9tablissements Monopole in [[Poissy]] on the outskirts of Paris, France.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/><ref name=\"ceha\"/> The new company specialised in producing pistons, piston-rings, valves, and other parts for automobile engines, and was managed by a Mr. Guerne.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/> The company's name is abbreviated Ets. Monopole, but \"Monopole-Poissy\" was used in the company's own literature.<ref name=\"ceha\"/>\n\nIn 1937\u201338, majority ownership of Monopole was acquired by Andr\u00e9 H\u00e9mard, son of Guy-Aristide H\u00e9mard of the H\u00e9mard distilling concern that merged his Pernod Fils company with Les \u00c9tablissements Pernod P\u00e8re et Fils to form Les \u00c9tablissements Pernod \u2014 Maisons Pernod Fils.\n\nIn 1944 H\u00e9mard installed his son-in-law Jean de Montr\u00e9my, until then working for aeronautical parts manufacturer Bronze-Avia, as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Monopole, whose clients by then included Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> H\u00e9mard's son [[Jean H\u00e9mard|Jean]] served as production director.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> His other son  {{Interlanguage link|Pierre H\u00e9mard|de|lt=Pierre}} also worked for the company.\n\nA merger with the Floquet sparkplug company resulted in a name change to ''Floquet Monopole''. Several other companies were later absorbed, including valve maker Jeudy, gudgeon pin maker Marty, and piston maker Nova.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/>\n\nOn 1 July 1963, the Perfect Circle Corporation of Hagerstown, Indiana, a maker of piston rings, became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Dana Incorporated]] of Toledo, Ohio.<ref name=\"waynet\"/> In 1978 Dana completed the acquisition of Floquet Monopole.<ref name=\"ft-aug1979\"/>\n\nAs late as the end of October 1995 the Floquet Monopole name remained in use in Europe, but by the beginning of 1998 it had been phased out, and the division was known as Perfect Circle.<ref name=\"uspto-1999\"/><ref name=\"cisg-case\"/> A former Floquet Monopole licensee purchased the rights to the name from Dana, incorporating as Floquet Monopole Industrie de Pr\u00e9cision in Fes, Morocco.<ref name=\"econ-jul2019\"/> Dana announced completion of the sale of the balance of its European parts divisions to [[Mahle]] on 9 March 2007.<ref name=\"dana-mahle\"/>\n\n==Monopole in racing==\n[[File:1956 Monopole-Panhard X86.jpg|thumb|A 1956 Monopole X86 berlinette.]]\n[[File:1956 Panhard-Monopole X86.jpg|thumb|Monopole X86 rear three-quarter view.]]\nWhile a student at [[Reims]], de Montr\u00e9my spent time at Circuit [[Reims-Gueux]], where he developed a taste for racing. As CEO of Monopole, he recognised the value of competition as a way to both test Monopole's products and promote the company. Efforts were focused on the small-displacement classes in endurance racing as conditions closest to what the parts would experience in normal road use.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> \u00c9curie Monopole was established to take the company racing.\n\nde Montr\u00e9my designed the first racing Monopole himself. This car used the chassis and engine of a [[Simca 8]], but clothed them in lightweight aluminium bodywork. Its debut race was at the Formula Libre Voiturette 2.0+1.1s at Reims on 6 July 1947, where the car finished seventh.<ref name=\"rsc-monopole-arch\"/> In 1948 two more Simca-Monopoles were built that used the Simca 8's engine, but these successors substituted custom-built lightweight chassis for the Simca original.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> These cars were raced throughout 1948 and 1949, including the first appearance of a Monopole at Le Mans, where the car driven by de Montr\u00e9my and {{Interlanguage link|Eug\u00e8ne Dussous|de|lt=Eug\u00e8ne Dussous}} finished twelfth overall and first in the S 1.1 class.\n\nRacing the Monopoles was to some extent a family affair, with de Montr\u00e9my and his brothers-in-law Jean and Pierre H\u00e9mard making many appearances in the cars, including at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1950, 1951, and 1953. Other Monopole racing drivers included brothers {{Interlanguage link|Pierre Chancel|de|lt=Pierre}} and {{Interlanguage link|Robert Chancel|de|lt=Robert Chancel}}, {{Interlanguage link|Pierre Flahault|de|lt=Pierre Flahault}}, [[Yvonne Simon]], and [[Jean Vinatier]].\n\nIn 1950 Panhard increased their involvement in racing, but indirectly, by offering parts and technical support to different racing teams. Monopole availed themselves of this to design a new racing car that used Panhard's air-cooled flat twin engine designed by [[Louis Delagarde]]. The car also used the [[front-wheel drive]] chassis of the [[Panhard Dyna X]], suitably modified.<ref name=\"spiritracer\"/><ref name=\"prt-3721\"/> The car was designed by Monopole's Pierre Bourdereau, who produced a very compact barquette, although due to its full-width [[Ponton (car)|ponton]]-style bodywork the car is often referred to as a ''tank'', as are some other Monopoles. The naming convention for Monopole's Panhard-based racing cars followed that used for the various Dyna X models.\n\nIn 1952 Monopole won both the Index of Performance and the eighteenth Biennial Cup for the third year in a row, making them the only manufacturer to achieve three such consecutive victories.\n\nIn 1953 Panhard decided to become directly involved in racing. Paul Panhard established a racing team under director Etienne de Valance.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> With the help of designer [[Marcel Riffard]] and later Pierre Durand, Panhard produced three models for their own racing efforts; the X88, X89 and VM5. As there were no corresponding Dyna X series X88 or X89, these designations were specific to the racing cars built by Panhard.\n\nIn 1956, following the accident at Le Mans in 1955, Panhard withdrew from direct racing involvement. \u00c9curie Monopole became Panhard's officially supported racing team. Staff as well as Panhard's racing cars were transferred to \u00c9curie Monopole at their location at Ach\u00e8res.<ref name=\"prt-745\"/><ref name=\"reissorg\"/> Personnel for the team numbered just eight.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/> Some entrant lists record the team as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Monopole Course rather than \u00c9curie Monopole.\n\nThe team increasingly tried to pursue GT events due to the shortage of sportscar events being run. At the end of the 1958 season the decision was made to close \u00c9curie Monopole.<ref name=\"fsw-jul2012\"/>\n\n==Racing cars==\nList of Monopole racing models:\n\n'''Monopole Sport'''\n* The first Monopole racer used both the {{convert|1090|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} inline four-cylinder engine and chassis of a [[Simca 8]], but with lightweight aluminium bodywork. In 1948 two additional copies were built that kept the Simca engine but used a custom chassis designed and built by Monopole. The car debuted at Reims in 1947, and won its class at Le Mans in 1949.\n\n'''Duval Monopole'''\n* This car, chassis DS 002, began to appear on tracks around 1951. It seems to have been one of the earlier Simca Monopole cars that had been modified by owner/driver Pierre Duval to accept a 2.0&nbsp;L V8 engine from a [[Ford Vedette]].<ref name=\"f2reg-1951\"/> Ford sold the Vedette model and the Poissy factory where it and the [[Ford Flathead V8 engine|flathead engine]] powering it were built to Simca in 1954.\n\n'''Monopole X84'''\n* Beginning with this model, Monopole based their racing cars on the [[Panhard Dyna X]] and its series numbers, using the donor's engine, chassis and running gear but with streamlined custom bodywork. The body style was a barquette, but was referred to as a ''tank''. Panhard's X84 series was the basis of the Dyna 100, and came with a GM600 S engine that displaced {{cvt|610|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} and developed {{cvt|22|CV|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm in standard tune. The Monopole X84 first appeared at Le Mans in 1950, where the number 52 car driven by de Montr\u00e9my and H\u00e9mard finished twenty-second overall. This model continued to appear at various races, including Le Mans, for several years after.\n\n'''Monopole X85'''\n* X85 was the series number for the Dyna 110. Engine displacement was the same as in the X84, but the GM600 SS2 engine developed {{cvt|28|CV|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm in factory tune. A Monopole X85 barquette with number 60 appeared at the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans]] driven by H\u00e9mard and de Montr\u00e9my.<ref name=\"lmh-eq1953\"/>\n\n'''Monopole X86'''\n* When Monopole upgraded to the X86 series from the Dyna 120, engine displacement grew to {{cvt|745|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} and was available in two levels of tune from the factory; the GM750 SS3 engine which developed {{cvt|32.6|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000, or the GM750 Sprint engine which developed {{cvt|33.5|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm. Monopole X86 cars appeared at Le Mans in 1955, then again in 1957 and 1958. Both barquette and berlinette versions of the X86 were built.\n\n'''Monopole X87'''\n* The X87 series embodied by the Dyna 130 received an engine of {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}}. Power from the standard GM 850 S engine was {{cvt|38|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm, while the Sprint engine produced {{cvt|42|CV|1|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm. The Monopole X87 appeared at Le Mans in 1953.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole X88'''\n* Originally built by Panhard and with no Dyna X model sharing its series number, the X88 was a unique design just for racing. The original 1953 Le Mans barquette bodywork by Riffard was wide and low, with a flat tapering tail. Panhard used a chassis of light alloy, and added bodywork of duralinox.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> The passenger compartment was faired in except for an opening for the driver, with a raised headrest as part of the bodywork behind his seat. At the front, the leading edges of the fenders projected forward, and were capped by conspicuous forward-facing conical covers. The first X88 was powered by a {{cvt|610|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} Panhard twin. The body of the X88 would be revised more than once, first to a more traditional sportscar style with exposed headlamps, then to a smooth curving nose with covered lamps.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole X89'''\n* As with the X88, the X89 was a racing-specific model first built by Panhard. The original bodywork for the 1953 Le Mans car was similar in appearance to that of the X88 and was also of duralinox. The X89, however, was powered by the larger {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} Panhard twin. As with the X88, the X89's body would later be revised, with at least one car being bodied as a closed berlinette with a smooth curving nose.\n\n'''Panhard-Monopole VM5'''\n*  In spring 1955 Panhard built two new cars designed by engineer Pierre Durand for the upcoming Le Mans race. Named VM5s, these barquettes were powered by {{cvt|848|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} flat-twins mounted in tubular chassis with fully independent suspension.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> The cars had a central seat and bodywork that was streamlined and very low; lower even than the X88 and X89 designed by Riffard.<ref name=\"prt-3647\"/> Panhard's VM5s appeared at Le Mans in 1955, as did two X88s newly built by Monopole.<ref name=\"reissorg\"/> One VM5, chassis 868 CA75, was raced at La Sarthe again in 1958 as a Monopole.<ref name=\"rsc-868_CA75\"/>\n\n'''Monopole-Oliveira Formula Junior'''\n* In late 1958 Monopole technician and racing mechanic Jos\u00e9 Carvallo de Oliveira asked de Montr\u00e9my for permission to build an open-wheeled [[Formula Junior]] car.<ref name=\"oliveira\"/> The new car used the same front-mounted, front-wheel drive flat-twin engine and suspension as the Monopole sportscars. The Monopole-Oliveira was raced in 1959 and 1960, then put into storage. Oliveira died in 2004, and his son sold the car in 2007. The fully restored car appeared at Brands Hatch in June 2008.\n\n== Racing record ==\n'''Reims Formula Libre'''\n* 1947 \u2014 Simca Monopole Sport driven by de Montr\u00e9my to a seventh-place finish.\n\n'''12 Hours of Paris'''\n* 1948 \u2014 Ninth place finish and class win in S 1.1 by de Montr\u00e9my and Dussous.

This leads into the key and main theme of the piece, C minor. In this first section, the orchestra carries the Russian-character melody, while the piano provides an accompanimental role, consisting of rapid oscillating arpeggios between both hands. After the statement of the long first theme, a quick and virtuosic \"''piu mosso''\" pianistic figuration transition leads into the lyrical second theme in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], the [[relative key]]. The second theme is first stated by the solo piano, with light accompaniment coming from the upper wind instruments. A transition which follows the chromatic scale eventually leads to the final reinstatement of the second theme, this time with the full orchestra at a piano dynamic. The [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] ends with an agitated closing section with scaling arpeggios on the E{{music|flat}} major scale in both hands.\n\nThe agitated and unstable development borrows motives from both themes, changing keys very often and giving the melody to different instruments while a new musical idea is slowly formed. The sound here, while focused on a particular tonality, has ideas of chromaticism. Two sequences of pianistic figurations lead to a placid, orchestral reinstatement of the first theme in the dominant 7th key of G. The development furthers with motifs from the previous themes, climaxing towards a B{{music|flat}} major \"''piu vivo''\" section. A triplet arpeggio section leads into the accelerando section, with the accompanying piano playing chords in both hands, and the string section providing the melody reminiscent of the second theme. The piece reaches a climax with the piano playing dissonant fortississimo ('''''fff''')'' chords, and with the horns and trumpets providing the syncopated melody.\n\nWhile the orchestra restates the first theme, the piano, that on the other occasion had an accompaniment role, now plays the march-like theme that had been halfly presented in the development, thus making a considerable readjustment in the exposition, as the main theme, the arpeggios in the piano serve as an accompaniment. This is followed by a piano-solo which continues the first theme and leads into a descending chromatic passage to a pianississimo A{{music|flat}} major chord. Then the second theme is heard played with a horn solo. The entrance of the piano reverts the key back into C minor, with triplet passages played over a mysterious theme played by the orchestra. Briefly, the piece transitions to a C major glissando in the piano, and is placid until drawn into the agitated closing section in which the movement ends in a C minor ''[[fortissimo]]''.\n\n===Adagio sostenuto \u2013 Pi\u00f9 animato \u2013 Tempo I: C minor \u2192 E major===\nThe second movement opens with a series of slow chords in the strings which modulate from the [[C minor]] of the previous movement to the E major of this movement.\n\nAt the beginning of the A section, the piano enters, playing a simple [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] figure.  This opening piano figure was composed in 1891 as the opening of the Romance from Two Pieces For Six Hands. The main theme is initially introduced by the [[Western concert flute|flute]], before being developed by an extensive [[clarinet]] solo. The [[motif (music)|motif]] is passed between the piano and then the strings.\n\nThen the B section is heard.  It builds up to a short climax centred on the piano, which leads to cadenza for piano.\n\nThe original theme is repeated, and the music appears to die away, finishing with just the [[Solo (music)|soloist]] in E major.\n\n===Allegro scherzando: E major \u2192 C minor \u2192 C major===\nThe last movement opens with a short orchestral introduction that modulates from E major (the key of the previous movement) to C minor, before a piano solo leads to the statement of the agitated first theme. After the original fast tempo and musical drama ends, a short transition from the piano solo leads to the second theme lyrical theme in B{{music|flat}} major is introduced by the [[oboe]] and violas. This theme maintains the motif of the first movement's second theme.  The exposition ends with a suspenseful closing section in B{{music|flat}} major.\n\nAfter that an extended and energetic development section is heard.  The development is based on the first theme of the exposition.  It maintains a very improvisational quality, as instruments take turns playing the stormy motifs.\n\nIn the recapitulation, the first theme is truncated to only 8 bars on the tutti, because it was widely used in the development section.  After the transition, the recapitulation's 2nd theme appears, this time in D{{music|flat}} major, half above the tonic.  However, after the ominous closing section ends it then builds up into a triumphant climax in C major from the beginning of the coda.  The movement ends very triumphantly in the tonic major with the same four-note rhythm ending the Third Concerto in D minor.\n\n==Reception==\nAfter the second and third movement premiered in December 1900 with Rachmaninoff as the soloist, the entire piece was first performed in 1901 and was enthusiastically received.{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=90, 95}} This concerto earned the composer a [[Mikhail Glinka#Legacy|Glinka Award]], the first of five awarded to him throughout his life, and a 500-rouble prize in 1904.{{sfn|Riesemann|1934|p=242}} The positive reception was a significant catalyst in the advancement of his recovery from continual depression.\n\n==Derivative works==\n{{listen\n|type=music\n|filename=Sergei Rachmaninov - Concerto no. 2 for Piano and Orchestra in C minor - 1.

This leads into the key and main theme of the piece, C minor. In this first section, the orchestra carries the Russian-character melody, while the piano provides an accompanimental role, consisting of rapid oscillating arpeggios between both hands. After the statement of the long first theme, a quick and virtuosic \"''piu mosso''\" pianistic figuration transition leads into the lyrical second theme in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], the [[relative key]]. The second theme is first stated by the solo piano, with light accompaniment coming from the upper wind instruments. A transition which follows the chromatic scale eventually leads to the final reinstatement of the second theme, this time with the full orchestra at a piano dynamic. The [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] ends with an agitated closing section with scaling arpeggios on the E{{music|flat}} major scale in both hands.\n\nThe agitated and unstable development borrows motives from both themes, changing keys very often and giving the melody to different instruments while a new musical idea is slowly formed. The sound here, while focused on a particular tonality, has ideas of chromaticism. Two sequences of pianistic figurations lead to a placid, orchestral reinstatement of the first theme in the dominant 7th key of G. The development furthers with motifs from the previous themes, climaxing towards a B{{music|flat}} major \"''piu vivo''\" section. A triplet arpeggio section leads into the accelerando section, with the accompanying piano playing chords in both hands, and the string section providing the melody reminiscent of the second theme. The piece reaches a climax with the piano playing dissonant fortississimo ('''''fff''')'' chords, and with the horns and trumpets providing the syncopated melody.\n\nWhile the orchestra restates the first theme, the piano, that in the other occasion had an accompaniment role, now plays the march-like theme that had been halfly presented in the development, thus making a considerable readjustment in the exposition, as the main theme, the arpeggios in the piano serve as an accompaniment. This is followed by a piano-solo which continues the first theme and leads into a descending chromatic passage to a pianississimo A{{music|flat}} major chord. Then the second theme is heard played with a horn solo. The entrance of the piano reverts the key back into C minor, with triplet passages played over a mysterious theme played by the orchestra. Briefly, the piece transitions to a C major glissando in the piano, and is placid until drawn into the agitated closing section in which the movement ends in a C minor ''[[fortissimo]]''.\n\n===Adagio sostenuto \u2013 Pi\u00f9 animato \u2013 Tempo I: C minor \u2192 E major===\nThe second movement opens with a series of slow chords in the strings which modulate from the [[C minor]] of the previous movement to the E major of this movement.\n\nAt the beginning of the A section, the piano enters, playing a simple [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] figure.  This opening piano figure was composed in 1891 as the opening of the Romance from Two Pieces For Six Hands. The main theme is initially introduced by the [[Western concert flute|flute]], before being developed by an extensive [[clarinet]] solo. The [[motif (music)|motif]] is passed between the piano and then the strings.\n\nThen the B section is heard.  It builds up to a short climax centred on the piano, which leads to cadenza for piano.\n\nThe original theme is repeated, and the music appears to die away, finishing with just the [[Solo (music)|soloist]] in E major.\n\n===Allegro scherzando: E major \u2192 C minor \u2192 C major===\nThe last movement opens with a short orchestral introduction that modulates from E major (the key of the previous movement) to C minor, before a piano solo leads to the statement of the agitated first theme. After the original fast tempo and musical drama ends, a short transition from the piano solo leads to the second theme lyrical theme in B{{music|flat}} major is introduced by the [[oboe]] and violas. This theme maintains the motif of the first movement's second theme.  The exposition ends with a suspenseful closing section in B{{music|flat}} major.\n\nAfter that an extended and energetic development section is heard.  The development is based on the first theme of the exposition.  It maintains a very improvisational quality, as instruments take turns playing the stormy motifs.\n\nIn the recapitulation, the first theme is truncated to only 8 bars on the tutti, because it was widely used in the development section.  After the transition, the recapitulation's 2nd theme appears, this time in D{{music|flat}} major, half above the tonic.  However, after the ominous closing section ends it then builds up into a triumphant climax in C major from the beginning of the coda.  The movement ends very triumphantly in the tonic major with the same four-note rhythm ending the Third Concerto in D minor.\n\n==Reception==\nAfter the second and third movement premiered in December 1900 with Rachmaninoff as the soloist, the entire piece was first performed in 1901 and was enthusiastically received.{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=90, 95}} This concerto earned the composer a [[Mikhail Glinka#Legacy|Glinka Award]], the first of five awarded to him throughout his life, and a 500-rouble prize in 1904.{{sfn|Riesemann|1934|p=242}} The positive reception was a significant catalyst in the advancement of his recovery from continual depression.\n\n==Derivative works==\n{{listen\n|type=music\n|filename=Sergei Rachmaninov - Concerto no. 2 for Piano and Orchestra in C minor - 1.

Each fang was further divided into several ''pai'' ({{zh|c=\u724c|hp=p\u00e1i|l=placard|labels=no}}), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several [[hutong]]s (alleyways).\n\nThis system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the [[Tang dynasty]], and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Beijing]] was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word ''paifang'' referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the [[Song dynasty]], a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument.\n\n==Origin==\nIt is suggested that the Chinese paifang may have been derived from the [[torana]] temple-gate in ancient India,<ref>Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, Vol 4 part 3, p137-138</ref>  though it has taken on traditional Chinese architectural characteristics such as multi-tiered roofs, various supporting posts, and archway-shapes of traditional gates and towers.<ref>{{cite book|title=China's old dwellings|author=Ronald G.

A ''wutoumen'' was reserved for officials of rank 6 or higher.\n\nThe construction of wutomen was standardized in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' of the mid [[Song dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Li Jie |author-link=Li Jie (author) |script-title=zh:\u71df\u9020\u6cd5\u5f0f |title=Yingzao Fashi |volume=6: Minor Woodwork I |section=The Construction of Wutoumen}}</ref> It consisted of two posts and a horizontal beam forming a frame and two doors. By the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, it was called a ''pailou'' or ''paifang'', and evolved into a more elaborate structure with more posts and gates, with a superstructural gable on top; the highest rank was a five gate-six post-eleven gable pailou.\n\n==Style==\nPaifangs come in a number of forms. One form involves placing wooden pillars onto stone bases, which are bound together with wooden beams. This type of paifang is always beautifully decorated, with the pillars usually painted in red, the beams decorated with intricate designs and [[Chinese calligraphy]], and the roof covered with coloured tiles, complete with mythical beasts\u2014just like a Chinese palace. Another form of paifang is in the form of true archways made of stone or bricks; the walls may be painted, or decorated with coloured tiles; the top of the archways are decorated like their wooden counterparts. Yet another form of paifang, built mainly on religious and burial grounds, consists of plain white stone pillars and beams, with neither roof tiles nor any coloured decoration, but feature elaborate carvings created by master [[stonemason|masons]]. Another form is in the Han dynasty style, and is two matching towers, such as in Beihai.\n\nOutside of [[China]], the paifang has long been the symbol of [[Chinatown]]s. The largest outside of China, ''[[Friendship Archway]]'', can be found at [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Washington D.C.'s Chinatown]].\n\n[[History of China|In the past]], \"Chastity Paifangs\" were given to [[widow]]s who remained unmarried till [[death]], praising what was seen as loyalty to their deceased husbands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250px\" >\nFile:Ornamental Gateway (Pailou) from Han Dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE) across a Street Lined with Small Shops.

By the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, it was called a ''pailou'' or ''paifang'', and evolved into a more elaborate structure with more posts and gates, with a superstructural gable on top; the highest rank was a five gate-six post-eleven gable pailou.\n\n==Style==\nPaifangs come in a number of forms. One form involves placing wooden pillars onto stone bases, which are bound together with wooden beams. This type of paifang is always beautifully decorated, with the pillars usually painted in red, the beams decorated with intricate designs and [[Chinese calligraphy]], and the roof covered with coloured tiles, complete with mythical beasts\u2014just like a Chinese palace. Another form of paifang is in the form of true archways made of stone or bricks; the walls may be painted, or decorated with coloured tiles; the top of the archways are decorated like their wooden counterparts. Yet another form of paifang, built mainly on religious and burial grounds, consists of plain white stone pillars and beams, with neither roof tiles nor any coloured decoration, but feature elaborate carvings created by master [[stonemason|masons]]. Another form is in the Han dynasty style, and is two matching towers, such as in Beihai.\n\nOutside of [[China]], the paifang has long been the symbol of [[Chinatown]]s. The largest outside of China, ''[[Friendship Archway]]'', can be found at [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Washington D.C.'s Chinatown]].\n\n[[History of China|In the past]], \"Chastity Paifangs\" were given to [[widow]]s who remained unmarried till [[death]], praising what was seen as loyalty to their deceased husbands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n=== Chinese Paifang ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Ornamental Gateway (Pailou) from Han Dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE) across a Street Lined with Small Shops.

The showpiece event was the final match of the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|2000\u201301]] edition of Europe's secondary cup competition, the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Liverpool were appearing in their third UEFA Cup final, after their appearances in [[1973 UEFA Cup Final|1973]] and [[1976 UEFA Cup Final|1976]]. It was the first European final they had reached since being banned from European competition following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Alav\u00e9s were appearing in their first European final.\n\nEach team had to progress through six knockout rounds with matches played over two legs. Both teams played 12 matches in total to reach the final. Liverpool's matches were mainly close affairs, none of their ties were won by more than two goals. The semi-final tie against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] was won 1\u20130. In contrast, Alav\u00e9s ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their first round tie against [[Gaziantepspor]] by one goal, whereas they beat [[1. FC Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] 9\u20132 in the semi-final.\n\nWatched by a crowd of 48,050, Liverpool took an early lead when [[Markus Babbel]] scored in the fourth minute. They extended their lead in the 16th minute when [[Steven Gerrard]] scored. Midway through the first half, [[Iv\u00e1n Alonso]] scored to bring Alav\u00e9s within a goal of levelling the match. A few minutes before the end of the first half, Liverpool went 3\u20131 up when [[Gary McAllister]] scored from the penalty spot. Minutes after the start of the second half, [[Javi Moreno]] scored twice to level the match at 3\u20133. Liverpool went in front again in the 73rd minute when [[Robbie Fowler]] scored. With a minute remaining in the match, Alav\u00e9s equalised thanks to [[Jordi Cruyff]]. The match went into [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]], with the first half goalless. With the match heading for a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], [[Delf\u00ed Geli]] headed into his own net; as a result, Liverpool won on the [[golden goal]] rule. The victory meant Liverpool completed a [[Treble (association football)|Treble]] consisting of the [[Football League Cup]], [[FA Cup]] and UEFA Cup.\n\n==Route to the final==\n{{Main|2000\u201301 UEFA Cup}}\n\n===Liverpool===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n<!-- |+ '''Liverpool''' -->\n!scope=col|Round\n!scope=col width=\"130\" | Opposition\n!scope=col width=\"50\" | First leg\n!scope=col width=\"50\" | Second leg\n!scope=col width=\"50\" |Aggregate score\n|-\n!scope=row| 1st\n|align=\"left\"| [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]]\n| 1\u20130 (a)\n| 0\u20130 (h)\n| 1\u20130\n|-\n!scope=row| 2nd\n|align=\"left\"| [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]]\n| 1\u20130 (h)\n| 3\u20132 (a)\n| 4\u20132\n|-\n!scope=row| 3rd\n|align=\"left\"| [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]\n| 2\u20132 (a)\n| 2\u20130 (h)\n| 4\u20132\n|-\n!scope=row| 4th\n|align=\"left\"| [[A.S.

The showpiece event was the final match of the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|2000\u201301]] edition of Europe's secondary cup competition, the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Liverpool were appearing in their third UEFA Cup final, after their appearances in [[1973 UEFA Cup Final|1973]] and [[1976 UEFA Cup Final|1976]]. It was the first European final they had reached since being banned from European competition following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Alav\u00e9s were appearing in their first European final.\n\nEach team had to progress through six knockout rounds with matches played over two legs. Both teams played 12 matches in total to reach the final. Liverpool's matches were mainly close affairs, none of their ties were won by more than two goals. The semi-final tie against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] was won 1\u20130. In contrast, Alav\u00e9s ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their first round tie against [[Gaziantepspor]] by one goal, whereas they beat [[1. FC Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] 9\u20132 in the semi-final.\n\nWatched by a crowd of 48,050, Liverpool took an early lead when [[Markus Babbel]] scored in the fourth minute. They extended their lead in the 16th minute when [[Steven Gerrard]] scored. Midway through the first half, [[Iv\u00e1n Alonso]] scored to bring Alav\u00e9s within a goal of levelling the match. A few minutes before the end of the first half, Liverpool went 3\u20131 up when [[Gary McAllister]] scored from the penalty spot. Minutes after the start of the second half, [[Javi Moreno]] scored twice to level the match at 3\u20133. Liverpool went in front again in the 73rd minute when [[Robbie Fowler]] scored. With a minute remaining in the match, Alav\u00e9s equalised thanks to [[Jordi Cruyff]]. The match went into [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]], with the first half goalless. With the match heading for a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], [[Delf\u00ed Geli]] headed into his own net; as a result, Liverpool won on the [[golden goal]] rule.
