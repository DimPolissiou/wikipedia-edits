Kingdoms in the south east coast of the Indian Subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. This led to [[Indianisation]] and [[Sanskritisation]] of Southeast Asia within [[Indosphere]], Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Mandala (political model)|Mandala]] (polities, city states and confederacies).  \n\nUnlike the Hindu kingdoms within the Indian sub-continent, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava empire]] of the southeastern coast of the India peninsula did not have culture restrictions on crossing the sea. [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] also had profound impact on Southeast Asia, who executed [[South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I]] and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]]. This led to more exchanges through the sea routes into Southeast Asia. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of the Southeast Asia, it died off on the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe peoples of [[maritime Southeast Asia]] \u2014 present day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are thought to have migrated southwards from southern China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization of the subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and among the peoples of the Southeast Asian mainland. \n\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influence in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE. Hinduism and Buddhism both spread to these states from India and for many centuries existed there with mutual toleration. Eventually the states of the mainland became mainly Buddhist.\n\n<!--\nTO BE CLEANED UP LATER with edit comment Updating from [[Silk road]], [[Indian maritime history]], [[Maritime Silk Route]]. \n\n==Drivers of Indianisation of Southeast Asia==\nKey driver of [[Indianisation]] of Southeast Asia were [[Indian maritime history|Indian maritime trade]] especially [[Spice trade]], emissaries of Ashoka, [[Ashoka#Buddhist_missions|Buddhist missions]] of [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka - the Great]], \n\n==Indian maritime with Southeast Asia==\n{{see also | Indian maritime history | Spice trade }}\n[[File:Indian ship on lead coin of Vashishtiputra Shri Pulumavi.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Indian ship on lead coin of [[Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi]], testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE.]]\n\nThe first clear mention of a navy occurs in the mythological epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref name=Chakravarti>Chakravarti (1930)</ref> Historically, however, the first attested attempt to organise a navy in India, as described by [[Megasthenes]] (c. 350\u2014290 BCE), is attributed to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign 322\u2014298 BCE).<ref name=Chakravarti/> The [[Mauryan empire]] (322\u2013185 BCE) navy continued till the times of emperor [[Ashoka]] (reign 273\u201432 BCE), who used it to send massive diplomatic missions to Greece, [[Syria]], Egypt, [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]].<ref name=Chakravarti/> Following nomadic interference in [[Siberia]]\u2014one of the sources for India's bullion\u2014India diverted its attention to the [[Malay peninsula]], which became its new source for gold and was soon exposed to the world via a series of maritime [[trade route]]s.<ref name=shaffer309/> The period under the Mauryan empire also witnessed various other regions of the world engage increasingly in the Indian Ocean maritime voyages.<ref name=shaffer309 />\n\n=== Buddhist missions ===\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] \u2013 who is patronised by Ashoka \u2013 sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE. This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras \u2013 Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n* Mahinda to Sri Lanka\n* Majjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\n* Mahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\n* Rakkhita to Vanavasa\n* Dhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\n* Maha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\n* Maharakkhita to the Greek country\n* Majjhima to the Himalayas\n* So\u1e47a and Uttara to Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\n\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\n\nScholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}} Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities.

The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as \"Great Vehicle\". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the [[Khotan]] region.<ref name=\"Foltz 1999 38\"/> The Mahayana, which was more of a \"pan-Buddhist movement\" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this \"Greater Vehicle\" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=41}}</ref> With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed. This form of Buddhism highlighted, as stated by Xinru Liu, \"the elusiveness of physical reality, including material wealth.\" It also stressed getting rid of material desire to a certain point; this was often difficult for followers to understand.<ref>Xinru Liu, \"The Silk Road in World History\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 21.</ref>\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries CE, [[merchants]] played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.<ref>[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 43\u201344.</ref> Merchants also helped to establish [[diaspora]] within the communities they encountered, and over time their cultures became based on Buddhism.

Historians believe that there was a forerunner Indianised Hindu-Buddhist state to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest [[Borneo]] in the 7th century.{{efn|1=Not to be confused with the [[Vijayapura|Indian state of the same name]].}} It was probably a subject state of the powerful Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]].  One predecessor state was called Po-ni (pinyin: Boni).<ref>This view recently has been challenged. See Johannes L. Kurz \"Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the Qing Dynasties\", paper accessible under http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=172 (2006)</ref>  By the 10th century Po-ni had contacts with first the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasty and at some point even entered into a tributary relationship with China.  By the 14th century Po-ni also fell under the influence of the Indianised Hindu [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit]] Empire. The book of [[Nagarakretagama]], canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365 mentioned ''Berune'' as a vassal state of Majahpahit.<ref>{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher=Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | archive-date=23 May 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However this may have been nothing more than a symbolic relationship, as one account of the annual tribute owed each year to Majahpahit was a jar of [[areca]] juice obtained from the young green nuts of the areca palm. The Ming dynasty resumed communications with Po-ni in the 1370s and the Po-ni ruler Ma-na-jih-chia-na visited the Ming capital Nanjing in 1408 and died there; [[Tomb of the King of Boni|his tomb]] was rediscovered in the 20th century, and is now a protected monument.\n\n===Indianised Islamic sultanate (~1400 - present day)===\nIn 1402, [[Sultan Muhammad Shah]] died, he was first to convert from Hindu-Buddhism to Islam, and his pre-conversion name was Awang Alak Betatar.\n\n==Burma (Myanmar)==\nAt the western end of the South East Asian mainland, Lower Burma was occupied by the Mon peoples who are thought to have come originally from western China. In Lower Burma they supplanted an earlier people: the Pyu, of whom little is known except that they practised Hinduism. \n\n===Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward)===\nThe Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mins were the earliest known civilization in Southeast Asia. They consisted of several Mon kingdoms, spreading from Lower Burma into much of Thailand, where they founded the kingdom of Dvaravati. Their principal settlements in Burma were Thaton and Pegu. \n\n===Tibeto-Burman Buddhist kingdoms (11th - 13th century CE )===\nFrom about the 9th century onward Tibeto-Burman tribes moved south from the hills east of Tibet into the Irrawaddy plain. They founded their capital at Pagan in Upper Burma in the 10th century. They eventually absorbed the Mons, their cities and adopted the Mon civilization and Buddhism. The Pagan kingdom united all Burma under one rule for 200 years - from the 11th to 13th centuries. The zenith of its power occurred during the reign of King Anawratha (1044\u20131077), who conquered the Mon kingdom\nof Thaton. King Anawratha built many of the temples for which Pagan is famous. It is estimated that some 13,000 temples once existed within the city, which some 5,000 still stand.\n\n===13th-21st century===\n{{empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Cambodia==\n===Funan===\n[[File:Siem Reap Reflections (CAMBODIA-REFLECTION-ANGKOR WAT) VI (1070423631).jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Angkor Wat]]]]\nThe first of these Hinduised states to achieve widespread importance was the [[Kingdom of Funan]] founded in the 1st century CE in what is now [[Cambodia]] \u2014 according to legend, after the marriage of a Brahman into the family of the local chief. These local inhabitants were [[Khmer people]]. Funan flourished for some 500 years. It carried on a prosperous trade with India and China, and its engineers developed an extensive canal system. An elite practised statecraft, art and science, based on Indian culture. Vassal kingdoms spread to southern Vietnam in the east and to the [[Malay Peninsula]] in the west.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Chenla and Angkor===\nIn late 6th century CE, dynastic struggles caused the collapse of the Funan empire. It was succeeded by another Hindu-Khmer state, Chen-la, which lasted until the 9th century. Then a [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] king, Jayavarman II (about 800-850) established a capital at [[Angkor]] in central Cambodia. He founded a cult which identified the king with the Hindu God Shiva \u2013 one of the triad of Hindu gods, Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, Shiva the god symbolising destruction and reproduction.  The Angkor empire flourished from the 9th to the early 13th century. It reached the peak of its fame under Jayavarman VII at the end of the 12th century, when its conquests extended into Thailand in the west (where it had conquered the Mon kingdom of Dwaravati) and into Champa in the east. Its most celebrated memorial is the great temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built early in the 12th century.  This summarises the position on the South East Asian mainland until about the 12th century. Meanwhile, from about the 6th century, and until the 14th century, there was a series of great maritime empires based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. In early days these Indians came mostly from the ancient kingdom of Kalinga, on the south-eastern coast of India. Indians in Indonesia are still known as \"Klings\", derived from Kalinga.\n\n==East Timor==\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 page 378\">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |url=https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean/page/378 378]|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}</ref>\n\n===Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century ~ 16th century) ===\n{{main| History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia | Greater India | Indosphere | Indianisation }}\n\n====Earlier Buddhist era (3rd century BCE - 7th century) ====\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Indianised Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th - 12th century) ====\n{{main| Srivijaya empire }}\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\nOral traditions of people of [[Wehali]] principality of East Timor mention their  migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or ''\"Chinese White [[Malacca]]\"'' (part of [[Indianisation|Indianised]] Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya empire]]) in ancient times.<ref>H.J.

In the islands of Southeast Asia the first organised state to achieve fame was the Hindu Malay kingdom of [[Srivijaya]], with its capital at Palembang in southern [[Sumatra]]. Its commercial pre-eminence was based on command of the sea route from India to China between Sumatra and the Malay peninsula (later known as the Straits of [[Malacca]]). In the 6th \u2013 7th centuries [[Srivijaya]] succeeded Funan as the leading state in Southeast Asia. Its ruler was the overlord of the Malay peninsula and western [[Java]] as well as [[Sumatra]]. Like most of the early kingdoms of Soutehast Asia, Srivijaya was Dravidian in culture and administration, and Buddhism became firmly entrenched there. \n\n===Sailendra kingdom===\nThe expansion of Srivijaya was resisted in eastern Java, where the powerful Buddhist [[Sailendra]] dynasty arose. (From the 7th century onwards there was great activity in temple building in eastern Java. The most impressive of the ruins is at Borobudur, considered to have been the largest Buddhist temple in the world.) Sailendra rule spread to southern Sumatra, and up to Malay peninsula to [[Cambodia]] (where it was replaced by the [[Angkor]] kingdom). In the 9th century, the Sailendras moved to Sumatra, and a union of Srivijaya and the Sailendras formed an empire which dominated much of Southeast Asia for the next five centuries. With the departure of the Sailendras a new Majapahit kingdom appeared in eastern Java, which reverted from Buddhism to Hinduism. After 500 Years of supremacy Srivijaya was superseded by Majapahit. The various Indianised states and empires of this first 1500 years CE, though founded by Indian colonisation and maintaining diplomatic contacts with India, remained politically independent of the Indian kingdoms. The only exception to this was the temporary conquest of Malaya by the [[Chola]] kingdom of southern India in the 11th century.\n\n===Mataram kingdom===\nIn the 10th century, Mataram, challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; and the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java.\n\n===Kediri kingdom===\nKediri kingdom, spread its influence to the eastern part of Southeast Asia and became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming of increasing importance, as the demand by European countries for spices grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and Kediri became a strong trading nation. \n\n===Singhasari kingdom===\nIn the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. \n\n===Majapahit empire===\nBy the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas.

A 7th-century Indian drama, ''Kaumudhimahotsva'', refers to Kedah as Kataha-nagari. The ''Agnipurana'' also mentions a territory known as Anda-Kataha with one of its boundaries delineated by a peak, which scholars believe is [[Gunung Jerai]]. Stories from the ''Katasaritasagaram'' describe the elegance of life in Kataha. The Buddhist [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom|kingdom of Ligor]] took control of Kedah shortly after. Its king [[Chandrabhanu]] used it as a base to attack [[Sri Lanka]] in the 11th century and ruled the northern parts, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in [[Tamil Nadu]] and in the Sri Lankan chronicles, ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.\n\n=====Decline of Srivijaya empire and inner fights of breakup vassal states (12th - 13th century)=====\nAt times, the Khmer kingdom, the Siamese kingdom, and even Cholas kingdom tried to exert control over the smaller Malay states.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The power of Srivijaya declined from the 12th century as the relationship between the capital and its vassals broke down. Wars with the Javanese caused it to request assistance from China, and wars with Indian states are also suspected. In the 11th century, the centre of power shifted to [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]], a port possibly located further up the Sumatran coast near the [[Batang Hari River|Jambi River]].<ref name=\"History\"/> The power of the Buddhist Maharajas was further undermined by the [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]]. Areas which were converted to Islam early, such as [[Aceh]], broke away from Srivijaya's control. By the late 13th century, the Siamese kings of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] had brought most of Malaya under their rule. In the 14th century, the Hindu Java-based [[Majapahit]] empire came into possession of the peninsula.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n===Defeat and conversion to Islamic sultanates in 14th and 15th century===\nIn the 14th century that first [[Islam]]ic sultanate was established. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

The ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'' (''Malay Annals'') contains a tale of a prince of [[Srivijaya]], Sri Tri Buana (also known as [[Sang Nila Utama]]), who landed on Temasek after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a [[Asiatic lion|lion]]; believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means \"Lion City\" in [[Sanskrit]]. It is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though [[tiger]]s continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for \"throne\" in the [[Malay language]] is \"singgasana\", meaning \"lion's seat\" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the \"Singapura\" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent.<ref name=\"baker\">{{cite book | last = Baker | first = Jim | title = Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia | date = 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDifferent versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by  [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] from Palembang.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N.

Evidence of strong religious, cultural and linguistic links abound.\n\n===Propagation of Buddhism in Thailand by emperor Ashoka (3rd centure BCE)===\nHistorically, the cultural and economic interaction between the two countries can be traced to roughly around the 6th century B.C. The single most significant cultural contribution of India, for which Thailand is greatly indebted to India, is [[Buddhism]]. Propagated in Thailand in the 3rd century B.C. by Buddhist monks sent by [[King Asoka]], it was adopted as the state religion of Thailand and has ruled the hearts and minds of Thais ever since. Presently 58,000,000 Thais, an overwhelming 94% of the total Thai populace adheres to Buddhism. However, direct contact can be said to have begun only in the 3rd century B.C. when King Asoka sent Buddhist monks to propagate Buddhism in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Besides Buddhism, Thailand has also adopted other typically Indian religious and cultural traditions. The ceremonies and rites especially as regards the Monarchy evidence a strong Hindu influence.\n\n===Sukhothai period: Settlement of Indian traders and Brahmins in Thailand (1275\u20131350) ===\nThe Indians who moved into Thailand in the [[Sukhothai period]] (1275\u20131350) were either merchants who came to Siam or Thailand, for the purpose of trading or [[Brahmans]] who played an important role in the Siamese court as experts in astrology and in conducting ceremonies. The first group of Brahmans who entered Siam before the founding of Sukhothai as the first capital of Siam (1275\u20131350) popularized Hindu beliefs and traditions. During the Sukhothai period Brahman temples already existed. Brahmans conducted ceremonies in the court. The concepts of divine kingship and royal ceremonies are clear examples of the influence of Brahmanism.\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] are practiced more or less in its original form even up to the present reign. The Thai idea that the king is a reincarnation of the Hindu deity [[Vishnu]] was adopted from Indian tradition. (Though this belief no longer exists today, the tradition to call each Thai king of the present Chakri dynasty Rama (Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu) with an ordinal number, such as Rama I, Rama II etc. is still in practice.)\n\n===SukhAyutthaya period: Settlement of more Indian Tamil traders in Thailand (1350\u20131767 CE) ===\nIn the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] era (1350\u20131767), more Tamil merchants entered the South of the country by boat as evidenced by the statues of Hindu gods excavated in the South.\n\n===Later migration of Indians to Thailand (1855 CE - present day) ===\nAfter the year 1855, the Tamils who migrated to Thailand can be classified into three groups according to the religion they believed in, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. \n\n===Indian cultural influence on Thailand===\n====Dance====\n[[Thai literature]] and [[Thai art|drama]] draws great inspiration from [[Indian art]]s and [[Hindu mythology|legend]]. The Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] is as popular in Thailand as it is in India. Thailand has adapted the Ramayana to suit the Thai lifestyle in the past and has come up with its own version of the Ramayana, namely, the [[Ramakien]].\n\nTwo of the most popular classical dances the [[Khon]], performed by men wearing ferocious masks, and the [[Dance_in_Thailand#Lakhon|Lakhon]] ([[Lakhon nai]], [[Lakhon chatri]] and [[Lakhon nok]]), performed by women who play both male and female roles draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien. Percussion instruments and [[Piphat]], a type of woodwind accompany the dance.<ref name=\"indthai\">http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Historical-Ties-India-and-Thailand-1.aspx</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are [[shadow play]] called [[nang talung]] in Thai. This is a show in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to represent human figures with movable arms and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In [[South India]], this kind of show is called Bommalattam.\n\n====Language====\n\n[[Thai language]] too bears close affinity with Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. An indication of the close linguistic affiliation between India and Thailand can be found in common Thai words like Ratha Mantri, Vidhya, Samuthra, Karuna, Prannee etc. which are almost identical to their Indian counterparts. Thai language basically consists of monosyllabic words that are individually complete in meaning. His Majesty King [[Ram Khamhaeng]] the Great created the [[Thai script|Thai alphabet]] in 1283. He modeled it on the ancient Indian alphabets of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] through the medium of the [[Khmer script|old Khmer characters]]. Like most world languages, the Thai language is a complicated mixture derived from several sources. Many Thai words used today were derived from [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], Khmer, Malay, English and Chinese.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Religious ceremonies and festivals====\nSeveral Thai ceremonies have been adopted from Indian tradition. These include ceremonies related to ordination, marriage, merit making and cremation. Though the Lord Buddha is the prime inspiration of Thailand, Brahma and other Hindu deities are widely worshipped among the Thais, due in part to the popularity of the Hindu ceremonial rites, which are used especially for royal ceremonies.\n\n(1) The '''[[Triyampawai ceremony|Triyampawai Ceremony]] or the Giant Swing Ceremony'''. Originally a [[Brahmin]] ceremony performed to pay homage to the God [[Shiva]], it was traditionally held front of [[Wat Suthat]], while the King and Queen watched the ceremony from a gold silk pavilion. Though the ceremony was abolished during the reign of King [[Rama VII]] due to a severe economic fall, Brahman priests are still allocated money to make offerings to God Shiva.\n\n(2) The '''[[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]]''', which is officiated by H.M. the king at [[Sanam Luang]] in May every year with pomp. Originally a Brahmanic rite, it was adopted to mark the beginning of the farming season as also to bless all farmers with fertility for the year.\n\n(3) The '''Royal Ceremony for preparing Celestial Rice''' or [[Glutinous_rice#Thai|Khao thip]] which was said to be originally prepared by celestial beings in honor of God Indra. A portion of the celestial rice is offered to monks while the remainder was divided in varying quantities among the royal family, courtiers and household members. The making of the ambrosial dish has come to a natural end since custom demanded that virgins alone should perform the preparation and stirring of celestial rice.\n\n(4) The '''[[Kathina]] Ceremony''' or the period during which Buddhist monks receive new robes, which generally falls in the months of October- November.\n\n(5) '''[[Loy Krathong]]''' \u2013 the Festival of Lights which is celebrated on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. The [[Loi Krathong|floating of Loi Krathong lanterns]], which began in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] period, continued throughout the different stages of Thai history. The present day understanding is that the festival is celebrated as an act of worship to [[Phra Mae Thorani|Chao Mae Kangka]], the Goddess of the Waters, for providing the water much needed throughout the year, and as a way of asking forgiveness if they have polluted it or used it carelessly.\n\n(6) '''[[Songkran]] Festival''': Songkran day marks Thai New Year day. \"Songkran\" signifies the sun's move into the first house of the zodiac. It is similar to Indian [[Holi]].\n\n(7) '''[[Vesak|Visakha]] Puja Day''' which is considered as the greatest Buddhist holy day as it commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Lord Buddha.\n\nOther famous ceremonial holy days include [[M\u0101gha P\u016bj\u0101|Magha Puja]] day, in February and [[Asalha Puja]] day in July which commemorates the day on which Lord Buddha delivered the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|First Sermon]] to his five disciples, namely, Konthanya, Vassapa, Bhattiya, [[Mahanama]] and Assashi at [[Sarnath|Esipatanamaruekathayawan]] (Isipatana forest at Sarnath in India) and there explained his concept of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Ariyasai).<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Hindu astrology====\n[[Hindu astrology]] still has a great impact on several important stages of Thai life. Thai people still seek advice from knowledgeable Buddhist monks or Brahman astrologers about the auspicious or inauspicious days for conducting or abstaining from ceremonies for moving house or getting married.\n\n====Influence of Ayurveda on Thai traditional medicine and massage ====\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's writing, \u2018India's Benevolence to Thailand\u2019, the Thais also obtained the methods of making [[Ayurveda|herbal medicines]] (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like Sarabhi of [[Clusiaceae|Guttiferae family]], Kanika or [[Parijata|harsinghar]], phikun or [[Mimusops elengi]] and bunnak or the [[Mesua ferrea|rose chestnut]] etc. were brought from India.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Influence of Indian cuisine and spices on Thai cuisine ====\nThai monk [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's pointed out that [[Thai cuisine]] too was influenced by [[Indian cuisine]]. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use [[Ayurveda|spices]] in their food in various ways from Indians.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n==Vietnam==\n===Early Chinese vassal states===\nAt the eastern extremity of mainland Southeast Asia, northern [[Vietnam]] was originally occupied by Austro-Asiatic peoples. However, when regional power structures shifted [[Baiyue|tribes from Southern China]] began to settle in these lands. About 207 BC, a Chinese general, taking advantage of the temporary fragmentation of the Chinese Empire on the collapse of the Ch\u2019in dynasty, created in northern Vietnam the kingdom of Annam. During the 1st century BC, Annam was incorporated in the Chinese Empire of the Han dynasty; and it remained a province of the empire until the fall of the T'ang dynasty early in the 10th century. It then regained its independence, often as a nominal Vassal of the Chinese Emperor.  \n\n===Establishment of Indianised Hindu kingdom of Champa by Indonesian rulers (10th century -) ===\nIn south-central Vietnam the Chams, a people of Indonesian stock, established the Hinduised kingdom of [[Champa]] c. 400. Subject to periodic invasions by the Annamese and by the Khmers of Cambodia, Champa survived and prospered. In 1471, a Vietnamese army of approximately 300,000, invaded Champa under Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u8056\u5b97). The invasion began as a consequence of Cham King's [[B\u00e0n La Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n|Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n]] attack on Vietnam in 1470. The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham slaughtering approximately 60,000. The Vietnamese destroyed, burnt and raided massive parts of Champa, seizing the entire kingdom. Thousands of Cham escaped to Cambodia, the remaining were forced to assimilate into [[Vietnamese culture]]. Today, only 80,000 Cham remain in Vietnam.\n\n===Influence of Indian-origin Buddhism on Vietnam via Chinese culture===\nVietnam, or then known as [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] ([[wikt:\u5b89|\u5b89]] [[wikt:\u5357|\u5357]]; pinyin: \u0100nn\u00e1n), experienced little Hindu influence \u2013 usually via Champa. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries (except for Singapore and the Philippines), Vietnam was influenced by the Indian-origin religion Buddhism via the strong impact of [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of China]].\n\n==See also==\n* Spread of Indian influence\n** [[Greater India]]\n** [[Indosphere]]\n** [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]]\n\n* Trading routes\n** [[Maritime history of India]]\n** [[Silk route]]\n** [[Ancient maritime history]]\n\n* Other related\n** [[List of Southeast Asian leaders]]\n** [[Southeast Asian Games]]\n** [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]\n** [[Tiger Cub Economies]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George C\u0153d\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

Kingdoms in the south east coast of the Indian Subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. This led to [[Indianisation]] and [[Sanskritisation]] of Southeast Asia within [[Indosphere]], Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Mandala (political model)|Mandala]] (polities, city states and confederacies).  \n\nUnlike the Hindu kingdoms within the Indian sub-continent, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava empire]] of the southeastern coast of the India peninsula did not have culture restrictions on crossing the sea. [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] also had profound impact on Southeast Asia, who executed [[South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I]] and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]]. This led to more exchanges through the sea routes into Southeast Asia. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of the Southeast Asia, it died off on the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe peoples of [[maritime Southeast Asia]] \u2014 present day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are thought to have migrated southwards from southern China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization of the subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and among the peoples of the Southeast Asian mainland. \n\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influence in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE.

This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras \u2013 Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n* Mahinda to Sri Lanka\n* Majjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\n* Mahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\n* Rakkhita to Vanavasa\n* Dhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\n* Maha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\n* Maharakkhita to the Greek country\n* Majjhima to the Himalayas\n* So\u1e47a and Uttara to Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\n\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\n\nScholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}} Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities. The Sri Lankan chronicles, which belong to the Theravada school, exaggerate the role of the Theravadin monk Moggaliputta-Tissa in order to glorify their sect.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}}\n\nSome historians argue that Buddhism became a major religion because of Ashoka's royal patronage.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=32}} \n\n\n===Early Common Era\u2014High Middle Ages===\n{{main | Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya | Maritime history of Odisha }}\n{{See also | Sanskritisation |Chola dynasty|Chera dynasty|Pandya dynasty|Pallava dynasty}}\n[[Image:Rajendra map new.svg|thumb|right|300px|Chola territories during [[Rajendra Chola I]], c. 1030 CE.]]\n[[Image:Ship compartments.jpg|thumb|200px|Model of a [[Chola]] (200\u2014848 CE) ship's hull, built by the [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]], based on a wreck 19 miles off the coast of Poombuhar, displayed in a Museum in [[Tirunelveli]].]]\n\nDuring this era, [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia |Buddhist]] religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with [[Greater India|economic activity and commerce]] as patrons entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economy by estate management, craftsmanship and promotion of trading activities.<ref name=Donkin67>Donkin, 67</ref> [[Buddhism]], in particular, travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art and literacy.<ref name=Donkin69>Donkin, 69</ref>\n\nIn [[Java]] and [[Borneo]], the introduction of Indian culture created a demand for aromatics, and trading posts here later served Chinese and Arab markets.<ref name=Donkin1>Donkin, 59</ref> The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' names several Indian ports from where large ships sailed in an easterly direction to ''[[Chryse (placename)|Chryse]]''.<ref>Donkin, 64</ref> Products from the [[Maluku Islands]] that were shipped across the ports of Arabia to the [[Near East]] passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka.<ref name=Donkin4>Donkin, 92</ref> After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, products were sometimes shipped to [[East Africa]], where they were used for a variety of purposes including burial rites.<ref name=Donkin4/>\n\n[[Maritime history of Odisha]], known as [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in ancient times, started before 350&nbsp;BC according to early sources.

The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as \"Great Vehicle\". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the [[Khotan]] region.<ref name=\"Foltz 1999 38\"/> The Mahayana, which was more of a \"pan-Buddhist movement\" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this \"Greater Vehicle\" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=41}}</ref> With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed.

Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.<ref>[[Jerry H.

Historians believe that there was a forerunner Indianised Hindu-Buddhist state to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest [[Borneo]] in the 7th century.{{efn|1=Not to be confused with the [[Vijayapura|Indian state of the same name]].}} It was probably a subject state of the powerful Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]].  One predecessor state was called Po-ni (pinyin: Boni).<ref>This view recently has been challenged. See Johannes L. Kurz \"Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the Qing Dynasties\", paper accessible under http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=172 (2006)</ref>  By the 10th century Po-ni had contacts with first the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasty and at some point even entered into a tributary relationship with China.  By the 14th century Po-ni also fell under the influence of the Indianised Hindu [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit]] Empire.

The Ming dynasty resumed communications with Po-ni in the 1370s and the Po-ni ruler Ma-na-jih-chia-na visited the Ming capital Nanjing in 1408 and died there; [[Tomb of the King of Boni|his tomb]] was rediscovered in the 20th century, and is now a protected monument.\n\n===Indianised Islamic sultanate (~1400 - present day)===\nIn 1402, [[Sultan Muhammad Shah]] died, he was first to convert from from Hindu-Buddhism to to Islam, and his pre-conversion name was Awang Alak Betatar.\n\n==Burma (Myanmar)==\nAt the western end of the South East Asian mainland, Lower Burma was occupied by the Mon peoples who are thought to have come originally from western China. In Lower Burma they supplanted an earlier people: the Pyu, of whom little is known except that they practised Hinduism. \n\n===Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward)===\nThe Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mins were the earliest known civilization in Southeast Asia. They consisted of several Mon kingdoms, spreading from Lower Burma into much of Thailand, where they founded the kingdom of Dvaravati. Their principal settlements in Burma were Thaton and Pegu. \n\n===Tibeto-Burman Buddhist kingdoms (11th - 13th century CE )===\nFrom about the 9th century onward Tibeto-Burman tribes moved south from the hills east of Tibet into the Irrawaddy plain. They founded their capital at Pagan in Upper Burma in the 10th century. They eventually absorbed the Mons, their cities and adopted the Mon civilization and Buddhism. The Pagan kingdom united all Burma under one rule for 200 years - from the 11th to 13th centuries. The zenith of its power occurred during the reign of King Anawratha (1044\u20131077), who conquered the Mon kingdom\nof Thaton. King Anawratha built many of the temples for which Pagan is famous. It is estimated that some 13,000 temples once existed within the city, which some 5,000 still stand.\n\n===13th-21st century===\n{{empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Cambodia==\n===Funan===\n[[File:Siem Reap Reflections (CAMBODIA-REFLECTION-ANGKOR WAT) VI (1070423631).jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Angkor Wat]]]]\nThe first of these Hinduised states to achieve widespread importance was the [[Kingdom of Funan]] founded in the 1st century CE in what is now [[Cambodia]] \u2014 according to legend, after the marriage of a Brahman into the family of the local chief. These local inhabitants were [[Khmer people]]. Funan flourished for some 500 years. It carried on a prosperous trade with India and China, and its engineers developed an extensive canal system. An elite practised statecraft, art and science, based on Indian culture. Vassal kingdoms spread to southern Vietnam in the east and to the [[Malay Peninsula]] in the west.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Chenla and Angkor===\nIn late 6th century CE, dynastic struggles caused the collapse of the Funan empire. It was succeeded by another Hindu-Khmer state, Chen-la, which lasted until the 9th century. Then a [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] king, Jayavarman II (about 800-850) established a capital at [[Angkor]] in central Cambodia. He founded a cult which identified the king with the Hindu God Shiva \u2013 one of the triad of Hindu gods, Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, Shiva the god symbolising destruction and reproduction.  The Angkor empire flourished from the 9th to the early 13th century. It reached the peak of its fame under Jayavarman VII at the end of the 12th century, when its conquests extended into Thailand in the west (where it had conquered the Mon kingdom of Dwaravati) and into Champa in the east. Its most celebrated memorial is the great temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built early in the 12th century.  This summarises the position on the South East Asian mainland until about the 12th century. Meanwhile, from about the 6th century, and until the 14th century, there was a series of great maritime empires based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. In early days these Indians came mostly from the ancient kingdom of Kalinga, on the south-eastern coast of India. Indians in Indonesia are still known as \"Klings\", derived from Kalinga.\n\n==East Timor==\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 page 378\">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |url=https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean/page/378 378]|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}</ref>\n\n===Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century ~ 16th century) ===\n{{main| History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia | Greater India | Indosphere | Indianisation }}\n\n====Earlier Buddhist era (3rd century BCE - 7th century) ====\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Indianised Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th - 12th century) ====\n{{main| Srivijaya empire }}\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\nOral traditions of people of [[Wehali]] principality of East Timor mention their  migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or ''\"Chinese White [[Malacca]]\"'' (part of [[Indianisation|Indianised]] Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya empire]]) in ancient times.<ref>H.J.

In the islands of Southeast Asia the first organised state to achieve fame was the Hindu Malay kingdom of [[Srivijaya]], with its capital at Palembang in southern [[Sumatra]]. Its commercial pre-eminence was based on command of the sea route from India to China between Sumatra and the Malay peninsula (later known as the Straits of [[Malacca]]). In the 6th \u2013 7th centuries [[Srivijaya]] succeeded Funan as the leading state in Southeast Asia. Its ruler was the overlord of the Malay peninsula and western [[Java]] as well as [[Sumatra]]. Like most of the early kingdoms of Soutehast Asia, Srivijaya was Dravidian in culture and administration, and Buddhism became firmly entrenched there. \n\n===Sailendra kingdom===\nThe expansion of Srivijaya was resisted in eastern Java, where the powerful Buddhist [[Sailendra]] dynasty arose. (From the 7th century onwards there was great activity in temple building in eastern Java. The most impressive of the ruins is at Borobudur, considered to have been the largest Buddhist temple in the world.) Sailendra rule spread to southern Sumatra, and up to Malay peninsula to [[Cambodia]] (where it was replaced by the [[Angkor]] kingdom). In the 9th century, the Sailendras moved to Sumatra, and a union of Srivijaya and the Sailendras formed an empire which dominated much of Southeast Asia for the next five centuries. With the departure of the Sailendras a new Majapahit kingdom appeared in eastern Java, which reverted from Buddhism to Hinduism. After 500 Years of supremacy Srivijaya was superseded by Majapahit. The various Indianised states and empires of this first 1500 years CE, though founded by Indian colonisation and maintaining diplomatic contacts with India, remained politically independent of the Indian kingdoms. The only exception to this was the temporary conquest of Malaya by the [[Chola]] kingdom of southern India in the 11th century.\n\n===Mataram kingdom===\nIn the 10th century, Mataram, challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; and the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java.\n\n===Kediri kingdom===\nKediri kingdom, spread its influence to the eastern part of Southeast Asia and became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming of increasing importance, as the demand by European countries for spices grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and Kediri became a strong trading nation. \n\n===Singhasari kingdom===\nIn the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. \n\n===Majapahit empire===\nBy the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas.

A 7th-century Indian drama, ''Kaumudhimahotsva'', refers to Kedah as Kataha-nagari. The ''Agnipurana'' also mentions a territory known as Anda-Kataha with one of its boundaries delineated by a peak, which scholars believe is [[Gunung Jerai]]. Stories from the ''Katasaritasagaram'' describe the elegance of life in Kataha. The Buddhist [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom|kingdom of Ligor]] took control of Kedah shortly after. Its king [[Chandrabhanu]] used it as a base to attack [[Sri Lanka]] in the 11th century and ruled the northern parts, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in [[Tamil Nadu]] and in the Sri Lankan chronicles, ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.\n\n=====Decline of Srivijaya empire and inner fights of breakup vassal states (12th - 13th century)=====\nAt times, the Khmer kingdom, the Siamese kingdom, and even Cholas kingdom tried to exert control over the smaller Malay states.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The power of Srivijaya declined from the 12th century as the relationship between the capital and its vassals broke down. Wars with the Javanese caused it to request assistance from China, and wars with Indian states are also suspected. In the 11th century, the centre of power shifted to [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]], a port possibly located further up the Sumatran coast near the [[Batang Hari River|Jambi River]].<ref name=\"History\"/> The power of the Buddhist Maharajas was further undermined by the [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]]. Areas which were converted to Islam early, such as [[Aceh]], broke away from Srivijaya's control. By the late 13th century, the Siamese kings of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] had brought most of Malaya under their rule. In the 14th century, the Hindu Java-based [[Majapahit]] empire came into possession of the peninsula.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n===Defeat and conversion to Islamic sultanates in 14th and 15th century===\nIn the 14th century that first [[Islam]]ic sultanate was established. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

Evidence of strong religious, cultural and linguistic links abound.\n\n===Propagation of Buddhism in Thailand by emperor Ashoka (3rd centure BCE)===\nHistorically, the cultural and economic interaction between the two countries can be traced to roughly around the 6th century B.C. The single most significant cultural contribution of India, for which Thailand is greatly indebted to India, is [[Buddhism]]. Propagated in Thailand in the 3rd century B.C. by Buddhist monks sent by [[King Asoka]], it was adopted as the state religion of Thailand and has ruled the hearts and minds of Thais ever since. Presently 58,000,000 Thais, an overwhelming 94% of the total Thai populace adheres to Buddhism. However, direct contact can be said to have begun only in the 3rd century B.C. when King Asoka sent Buddhist monks to propagate Buddhism in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Besides Buddhism, Thailand has also adopted other typically Indian religious and cultural traditions. The ceremonies and rites especially as regards the Monarchy evidence a strong Hindu influence.\n\n===Sukhothai period: Settlement of Indian traders and Brahmins in Thailand (1275\u20131350) ===\nThe Indians who moved into Thailand in the [[Sukhothai period]] (1275\u20131350) were either merchants who came to Siam or Thailand, for the purpose of trading or [[Brahmans]] who played an important role in the Siamese court as experts in astrology and in conducting ceremonies. The first group of Brahmans who entered Siam before the founding of Sukhothai as the first capital of Siam (1275\u20131350) popularized Hindu beliefs and traditions. During the Sukhothai period Brahman temples already existed. Brahmans conducted ceremonies in the court. The concepts of divine kingship and royal ceremonies are clear examples of the influence of Brahmanism.\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] are practiced more or less in its original form even up to the present reign. The Thai idea that the king is a reincarnation of the Hindu deity [[Vishnu]] was adopted from Indian tradition. (Though this belief no longer exists today, the tradition to call each Thai king of the present Chakri dynasty Rama (Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu) with an ordinal number, such as Rama I, Rama II etc. is still in practice.)\n\n===SukhAyutthaya period: Settlement of more Indian Tamil traders in Thailand (1350\u20131767 CE) ===\nIn the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] era (1350\u20131767), more Tamil merchants entered the South of the country by boat as evidenced by the statues of Hindu gods excavated in the South.\n\n===Later migration of Indians to Thailand (1855 CE - present day) ===\nAfter the year 1855, the Tamils who migrated to Thailand can be classified into three groups according to the religion they believed in, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. \n\n===Indian cultural influence on Thailand===\n====Dance====\n[[Thai literature]] and [[Thai art|drama]] draws great inspiration from [[Indian art]]s and [[Hindu mythology|legend]]. The Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] is as popular in Thailand as it is in India. Thailand has adapted the Ramayana to suit the Thai lifestyle in the past and has come up with its own version of the Ramayana, namely, the [[Ramakien]].\n\nTwo of the most popular classical dances the [[Khon]], performed by men wearing ferocious masks, and the [[Dance_in_Thailand#Lakhon|Lakhon]] ([[Lakhon nai]], [[Lakhon chatri]] and [[Lakhon nok]]), performed by women who play both male and female roles draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien. Percussion instruments and [[Piphat]], a type of woodwind accompany the dance.<ref name=\"indthai\">http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Historical-Ties-India-and-Thailand-1.aspx</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are [[shadow play]] called [[nang talung]] in Thai. This is a show in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to represent human figures with movable arms and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In [[South India]], this kind of show is called Bommalattam.\n\n====Language====\n\n[[Thai language]] too bears close affinity with Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. An indication of the close linguistic affiliation between India and Thailand can be found in common Thai words like Ratha Mantri, Vidhya, Samuthra, Karuna, Prannee etc. which are almost identical to their Indian counterparts. Thai language basically consists of monosyllabic words that are individually complete in meaning. His Majesty King [[Ram Khamhaeng]] the Great created the [[Thai script|Thai alphabet]] in 1283. He modeled it on the ancient Indian alphabets of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] through the medium of the [[Khmer script|old Khmer characters]]. Like most world languages, the Thai language is a complicated mixture derived from several sources. Many Thai words used today were derived from [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], Khmer, Malay, English and Chinese.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Religious ceremonies and festivals====\nSeveral Thai ceremonies have been adopted from Indian tradition. These include ceremonies related to ordination, marriage, merit making and cremation. Though the Lord Buddha is the prime inspiration of Thailand, Brahma and other Hindu deities are widely worshipped among the Thais, due in part to the popularity of the Hindu ceremonial rites, which are used especially for royal ceremonies.\n\n(1) The '''[[Triyampawai ceremony|Triyampawai Ceremony]] or the Giant Swing Ceremony'''. Originally a [[Brahmin]] ceremony performed to pay homage to the God [[Shiva]], it was traditionally held front of [[Wat Suthat]], while the King and Queen watched the ceremony from a gold silk pavilion. Though the ceremony was abolished during the reign of King [[Rama VII]] due to a severe economic fall, Brahman priests are still allocated money to make offerings to God Shiva.\n\n(2) The '''[[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]]''', which is officiated by H.M. the king at [[Sanam Luang]] in May every year with pomp. Originally a Brahmanic rite, it was adopted to mark the beginning of the farming season as also to bless all farmers with fertility for the year.\n\n(3) The '''Royal Ceremony for preparing Celestial Rice''' or [[Glutinous_rice#Thai|Khao thip]] which was said to be originally prepared by celestial beings in honor of God Indra. A portion of the celestial rice is offered to monks while the remainder was divided in varying quantities among the royal family, courtiers and household members. The making of the ambrosial dish has come to a natural end since custom demanded that virgins alone should perform the preparation and stirring of celestial rice.\n\n(4) The '''[[Kathina]] Ceremony''' or the period during which Buddhist monks receive new robes, which generally falls in the months of October- November.\n\n(5) '''[[Loy Krathong]]''' \u2013 the Festival of Lights which is celebrated on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. The [[Loi Krathong|floating of Loi Krathong lanterns]], which began in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] period, continued throughout the different stages of Thai history. The present day understanding is that the festival is celebrated as an act of worship to [[Phra Mae Thorani|Chao Mae Kangka]], the Goddess of the Waters, for providing the water much needed throughout the year, and as a way of asking forgiveness if they have polluted it or used it carelessly.\n\n(6) '''[[Songkran]] Festival''': Songkran day marks Thai New Year day. \"Songkran\" signifies the sun's move into the first house of the zodiac. It is similar to Indian [[Holi]].\n\n(7) '''[[Vesak|Visakha]] Puja Day''' which is considered as the greatest Buddhist holy day as it commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Lord Buddha.\n\nOther famous ceremonial holy days include [[M\u0101gha P\u016bj\u0101|Magha Puja]] day, in February and [[Asalha Puja]] day in July which commemorates the day on which Lord Buddha delivered the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|First Sermon]] to his five disciples, namely, Konthanya, Vassapa, Bhattiya, [[Mahanama]] and Assashi at [[Sarnath|Esipatanamaruekathayawan]] (Isipatana forest at Sarnath in India) and there explained his concept of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Ariyasai).<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Hindu astrology====\n[[Hindu astrology]] still has a great impact on several important stages of Thai life. Thai people still seek advice from knowledgeable Buddhist monks or Brahman astrologers about the auspicious or inauspicious days for conducting or abstaining from ceremonies for moving house or getting married.\n\n====Influence of Ayurveda on Thai traditional medicine and massage ====\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's writing, \u2018India's Benevolence to Thailand\u2019, the Thais also obtained the methods of making [[Ayurveda|herbal medicines]] (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like Sarabhi of [[Clusiaceae|Guttiferae family]], Kanika or [[Parijata|harsinghar]], phikun or [[Mimusops elengi]] and bunnak or the [[Mesua ferrea|rose chestnut]] etc. were brought from India.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Influence of Indian cuisine and spices on Thai cuisine ====\nThai monk [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's pointed out that [[Thai cuisine]] too was influenced by [[Indian cuisine]]. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use [[Ayurveda|spices]] in their food in various ways from Indians.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n==Vietnam==\n===Early Chinese vassal states===\nAt the eastern extremity of mainland Southeast Asia, northern [[Vietnam]] was originally occupied by Austro-Asiatic peoples. However, when regional power structures shifted [[Baiyue|tribes from Southern China]] began to settle in these lands. About 207 BC, a Chinese general, taking advantage of the temporary fragmentation of the Chinese Empire on the collapse of the Ch\u2019in dynasty, created in northern Vietnam the kingdom of Annam. During the 1st century BC, Annam was incorporated in the Chinese Empire of the Han dynasty; and it remained a province of the empire until the fall of the T'ang dynasty early in the 10th century. It then regained its independence, often as a nominal Vassal of the Chinese Emperor.  \n\n===Establishment of Indianised Hindu kingdom of Champa by Indonesian rulers (10th century -) ===\nIn south-central Vietnam the Chams, a people of Indonesian stock, established the Hinduised kingdom of [[Champa]] c. 400. Subject to periodic invasions by the Annamese and by the Khmers of Cambodia, Champa survived and prospered. In 1471, a Vietnamese army of approximately 300,000, invaded Champa under Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u8056\u5b97). The invasion began as a consequence of Cham King's [[B\u00e0n La Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n|Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n]] attack on Vietnam in 1470. The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham slaughtering approximately 60,000. The Vietnamese destroyed, burnt and raided massive parts of Champa, seizing the entire kingdom. Thousands of Cham escaped to Cambodia, the remaining were forced to assimilate into [[Vietnamese culture]]. Today, only 80,000 Cham remain in Vietnam.\n\n===Influence of Indian-origin Buddhism on Vietnam via Chinese culture===\nVietnam, or then known as [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] ([[wikt:\u5b89|\u5b89]] [[wikt:\u5357|\u5357]]; pinyin: \u0100nn\u00e1n), experienced little Hindu influence \u2013 usually via Champa. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries (except for Singapore and the Philippines), Vietnam was influenced by the Indian-origin religion Buddhism via the strong impact of [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of China]].\n\n==See also==\n* Spread of Indian influence\n** [[Greater India]]\n** [[Indosphere]]\n** [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]]\n\n* Trading routes\n** [[Maritime history of India]]\n** [[Silk route]]\n** [[Ancient maritime history]]\n\n* Other related\n** [[List of Southeast Asian leaders]]\n** [[Southeast Asian Games]]\n** [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]\n** [[Tiger Cub Economies]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George C\u0153d\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.
