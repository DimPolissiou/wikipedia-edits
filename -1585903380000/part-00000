When he returns, he is completely changed, especially in the aspects of his behaviour and ideologies which are different from the others in his family, This change will make the character look grey. There are  situations when his thought process counters his family, but the character is not completely grey.

Mohan respects her, appreciates her and tries to fulfill his responsibilities towards her, However he doesn't love her yet but slowly as the time passes by, he understands her value as his wife and begins to develop feelings for her which turn into true love.\n\nHis wife, on the other hand, is very righteous towards him and always puts him first. She fulfills all her duties as his wife and cares for him immensely. She is a woman who will do anything for her husband's and family's well-being and happiness.

It's standing apart from those who've found their conventional fit in this world, and recognizing that to be different is to be special. It's the courage to depart the familiar to a destination unknown. The 'space' is the intensity of youth. The cold sting of heartbreak. The suffocation of betrayal.

She is about to hit her nine-month sober milestone  and get her nine-month chip when BoJack calls her and asks her if she wants to party. She immediately accepts and downs a bottle of vodka. With the abundance of drugs and alcohol, they then proceed to drink and do drugs, as they reminisce and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around. However, BoJack begins to experience blackouts. After a few blackouts, in which Sarah Lynn asks to go to the planetarium twice, only for BoJack to reject the idea. They end up at an AA meeting because Sarah Lynn wants to get her nine-month sobriety chip. He has another blackout and comes to driving a car recklessly. Sarah Lynn tells him that he shut down the AA meeting, because he bummed everyone out.\n\nSarah Lynn also tells him, to try the twelve-step program, and to make amends to make himself feel better and get a clean slate. BoJack decides to go around and make amends to people. His first stop is Diane Nguyen and Mr. Peanutbutter's house. They break in and raid their fridge while waiting for them to come home. While they're doing this, the real Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter get home. They offer to let the two of them sleep it off in their guest bedroom but in their high state, BoJack and Sarah Lynn then run off. As they do, they shove into Diane and break her wrist again. BoJack then tries to make amends to Todd, although he ends up mistakenly apologizing to a little boy, who resembles Todd. \n\nBoJack next visits Ana Spanakopita. He asks her why she left and why she won't give them a chance to be broken together. She begins to tell him a story about why they can't work as a couple, but BoJack has another blackout. He makes Sarah Lynn drive back two more times, so that he can hear the story again, but continues to blackout. Finally, he goes to Princess Carolyn's apartment building, and tries to make amends by standing outside her apartment building on the roof of his car and screaming that he's sorry. Princess Carolyn just sighs and goes back inside with her boyfriend Ralph Stilton. BoJack returns to Ana's once again to hear her story. He apologizes for bothering her so much that night, and Ana informs him she hasn't seen him in two weeks. \n\nShe tells him her lifeguard story again\u2014after her near-death experiences a teen, where she drives her car into a lake and almost drowned. She became a lifeguard so that she would never be weaker than water. On her first day of training, her instructor told her that there will be times she will see someone in trouble, and she'll want to rush in and do anything she can to help them\u2014but she must stop herself because there are people you can't save. Those people will thrash and struggle, and try to take you down with them. BoJack doesn't get what that whole story has to do with him.\n\nBoJack has another blackout, and wakes up in the car, driving to Ohio to make amends with Penny; and to see if he messed up her life. He demands Sarah Lynn to turn the car around, but they end up at her school library. They spot Penny using the computer and BoJack says that they should stop following her, although he blacks out again and it's now later at night, outside of a party Penny is attending. BoJack says that she seems fine and that maybe he didn't ruin her. He agrees to leave after he urinates but ends up bumping into a group of guys, thus alerting Penny. She begins to freak out and tells him that he can't be here, she then says \"I was seventeen, I didn\u2019t know any better!\" The people around them start to recognize Sarah Lynn and BoJack and begin to take pictures of them, so they leave as a frightened Penny disappears into the crowd.\n\nBack in the car, Sarah Lynn tells BoJack that Penny was probably doing great before they showed up and that they should've just left her alone; to BoJack's chagrin. On the car ride home, Sarah Lynn finds a pack of heroin nicknamed \"BoJack\" in Bojack's glove compartment. She tells BoJack that they should try it, with the caveat that having a drug named after you is a big deal. He says he doesn't want to shoot heroin. Later, after the two have returned to Sarah Lynn's house, BoJack says him and Sarah Lynn are gonna snort heroin, like sophisticated adults. After he snorts some heroin, BoJack blacks out again. During his blackout, he has a flashback to Thanksgiving 2007, at Cuddlywhiskers's house. Everything in the background is shaking around them. Cuddlywhiskers gets off the phone with the network executives, and they had told him the latest episode of The BoJack Horseman Show, had gotten the lowest ratings yet. He tells BoJack he still believes their show has an audience, and they should try to get a guest star to boost ratings, presumably Sarah Lynn. BoJack is uneasy about this, as she's \u201cthe world's biggest pop star\" and they hadn't spoken since Horsin\u2019 Around ended.\n\nBoJack wakes up. He then has a series of blackouts that transition him and Sarah Lynn to different locations. While this happens, he reminisces on their time together on Horsin' Around, and tells Sarah Lynn he feels like she's the only one who understands him. He elaborates, saying they can be friends because they're the only two people who knew each other before they were famous, and they like each other for who they really are. BoJack continues this speech, as the scene transitions, to the two of them laying on a bed in a hotel. BoJack says they don't want anything from each other, and he tells Sarah Lynn he loves her. She doesn't respond, and he panics, but she is apathetic about this and complains about being bored.\n\nShe turns on the TV and discovers the Oscars are on, to BoJack's surprise as he discovers how long they were actually on the bender. Sarah Lynn states she loves the glitz and glam of the Oscars. Sarah Lynn wins the Oscar for Best Original Song in absentia, which makes her ecstatic, but then regretful as she wasn't there to receive it. She tells BoJack if someone had told her as a kid she'd win an Oscar, she wouldn't have believed it, but now she has, and she cuts herself off. Sarah Lynn tells BoJack she doesn't like anything about herself. She says even her shirt came from a company who paid her $8,000 to wear it, despite her not needing the money, she just likes that someone still cared about her enough to want her to wear their shirt. BoJack tries to comfort her, but Sarah Lynn begins to panic, thinking she and everyone else is doomed. BoJack calms her down and finally agrees to take her to the planetarium. \n\nThe two are then in the planetarium watching a show. Sarah Lynn rests her head on BoJack's shoulder and says \"I wanna be an architect.\" The narrator says, their lives are but short flashes in a universe, that is billions of years old.

She is about to hit her nine-month sober milestone  and get her nine-month chip when BoJack calls her and asks her if she wants to party. She immediately accepts and downs a bottle of vodka. With the abundance of drugs and alcohol, they then proceed to drink and do drugs, as they reminisce and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around. However, BoJack begins to experience blackouts. After a few blackouts, in which Sarah Lynn asks to go to the planetarium twice, only for BoJack to reject the idea. They end up at an AA meeting because Sarah Lynn wants to get her nine-month sobriety chip. He has another blackout and comes to driving a car recklessly. Sarah Lynn tells him that he shut down the AA meeting, because he bummed everyone out.\n\nSarah Lynn also tells him, to try the twelve-step program, and to make amends to make himself feel better and get a clean slate. BoJack decides to go around and make amends to people. His first stop is Diane Nguyen and Mr. Peanutbutter's house. They break in and raid their fridge while waiting for them to come home. While they're doing this, the real Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter get home. They offer to let the two of them sleep it off in their guest bedroom but in their high state, BoJack and Sarah Lynn then run off. As they do, they shove into Diane and break her wrist again. BoJack then tries to make amends to Todd, although he ends up mistakenly apologizing to a little boy, who looks like Todd. \n\nBoJack next visits Ana Spanakopita. He asks her why she left and why she won't give them a chance to be broken together. She begins to tell him a story about why they can't work as a couple, but BoJack has another blackout. He makes Sarah Lynn drive back two more times, so that he can hear the story again, but continues to blackout. Finally, he goes to Princess Carolyn's apartment building, and tries to make amends by standing outside her apartment building on the roof of his car and screaming that he's sorry. Princess Carolyn just sighs and goes back inside with her boyfriend Ralph Stilton. BoJack returns to Ana's once again to hear her story. He apologizes for bothering her so much that night, and Ana informs him she hasn't seen him in two weeks. \n\nShe tells him her lifeguard story again\u2014after her near-death experiences a teen, where she drives her car into a lake and almost drowned. She became a lifeguard so that she would never be weaker than water. On her first day of training, her instructor told her that there will be times she will see someone in trouble, and she'll want to rush in and do anything she can to help them\u2014but she must stop herself because there are people you can't save. Those people will thrash and struggle, and try to take you down with them. BoJack doesn't get what that whole story has to do with him.\n\nBoJack has another blackout, and wakes up in the car, driving to Ohio to make amends with Penny; and to see if he messed up her life. He demands Sarah Lynn to turn the car around, but they end up at her school library. They spot Penny using the computer and BoJack says that they should stop following her, although he blacks out again and it's now later at night, outside of a party Penny is attending. BoJack says that she seems fine and that maybe he didn't ruin her. He agrees to leave after he urinates but ends up bumping into a group of guys, thus alerting Penny. She begins to freak out and tells him that he can't be here, she then says \"I was seventeen, I didn\u2019t know any better!\" The people around them start to recognize Sarah Lynn and BoJack and begin to take pictures of them, so they leave as a frightened Penny disappears into the crowd.\n\nBack in the car, Sarah Lynn tells BoJack that Penny was probably doing great before they showed up and that they should've just left her alone; to BoJack's chagrin. On the car ride home, Sarah Lynn finds a pack of heroin nicknamed \"BoJack\" in Bojack's glove compartment. She tells BoJack that they should try it, with the caveat that having a drug named after you is a big deal. He says he doesn't want to shoot heroin. Later, after the two have returned to Sarah Lynn's house, BoJack says him and Sarah Lynn are gonna snort heroin, like sophisticated adults. After he snorts some heroin, BoJack blacks out again. During his blackout, he has a flashback to Thanksgiving 2007, at Cuddlywhiskers's house. Everything in the background is shaking around them. Cuddlywhiskers gets off the phone with the network executives, and they had told him the latest episode of The BoJack Horseman Show, had gotten the lowest ratings yet. He tells BoJack he still believes their show has an audience, and they should try to get a guest star to boost ratings, presumably Sarah Lynn. BoJack is uneasy about this, as she's \u201cthe world's biggest pop star\" and they hadn't spoken since Horsin\u2019 Around ended.\n\nBoJack wakes up. He then has a series of blackouts that transition him and Sarah Lynn to different locations. While this happens, he reminisces on their time together on Horsin' Around, and tells Sarah Lynn he feels like she's the only one who understands him. He elaborates, saying they can be friends because they're the only two people who knew each other before they were famous, and they like each other for who they really are. BoJack continues this speech, as the scene transitions, to the two of them laying on a bed in a hotel. BoJack says they don't want anything from each other, and he tells Sarah Lynn he loves her. She doesn't respond, and he panics, but she is apathetic about this and complains about being bored.\n\nShe turns on the TV and discovers the Oscars are on, to BoJack's surprise as he discovers how long they were actually on the bender. Sarah Lynn states she loves the glitz and glam of the Oscars. Sarah Lynn wins the Oscar for Best Original Song in absentia, which makes her ecstatic, but then regretful as she wasn't there to receive it. She tells BoJack if someone had told her as a kid she'd win an Oscar, she wouldn't have believed it, but now she has, and she cuts herself off. Sarah Lynn tells BoJack she doesn't like anything about herself. She says even her shirt came from a company who paid her $8,000 to wear it, despite her not needing the money, she just likes that someone still cared about her enough to want her to wear their shirt. BoJack tries to comfort her, but Sarah Lynn begins to panic, thinking she and everyone else is doomed. BoJack calms her down and finally agrees to take her to the planetarium. \n\nThe two are then in the planetarium watching a show. Sarah Lynn rests her head on BoJack's shoulder and says \"I wanna be an architect.\" The narrator says, their lives are but short flashes in a universe, that is billions of years old. BoJack tells Sarah Lynn there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't matter what you did in the past or how you'll be remembered, all that matter is this precious moment that they are sharing together. He asks if she agrees, but she doesn't respond. He nudges her and says her name multiple times, but Sarah Lynn doesn't respond, Signaling that she died.\n", "name_user": "D and D master 2016", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Too_Much,_(BoJack_Horseman)"}

Jukola is the biggest orienteering relay event in the world. The race takes place on a Saturday between the 13th and 19th of June in different sites around Finland. The northernmost location has been 50&nbsp;km north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. The name '''Jukola''' is a family name in the classic [[Finland|Finnish]] novel, \"[[Seven Brothers]]\". The women's relay, known as the '''Venla Relay''', is a daytime race on the Saturday afternoon. It is named after the main female character from the novel.\n\nThe Jukola relay has seven legs with distances varying from 7 to 15&nbsp;km. The starting time is around 11&nbsp;pm when the sun sets. Runners for the first three legs usually wear headlights, depending on the geographical site (north or south of Finland) of the relay and the weather conditions. The winning team crosses the finishing line early on Sunday morning, around 6 or 7&nbsp;am, and the last teams finish just before the finish is closed in the afternoon. Women can participate in the Jukola relay in non-official teams (non-sports club teams, like company, family or other teams).<ref>{{Cite web| title = General information | url = http://www.jukola.com/en/tietoja-tapahtumasta/ | accessdate = 2015-06-15}}</ref>\n\nFor the women, an individual race with a mass start was organized in 1951. This was turned into a three leg relay race in 1978 and then a four leg relay race in 1981. \nIn 2012 the Jukola relay attracted close to 1700 teams and the Venla relay more than 1250. Clubs from 20 different countries took part.\n\nThe \"Kaukamets\u00e4l\u00e4iset\"<ref name=\"Kaukametsalaiset\">{{Cite web| title = Association Kaukamets\u00e4l\u00e4iset | url = http://www.jukola.com/en/kaukametsalaiset-ry/ | accessdate = 2012-03-11}}</ref> association is the founder of the Jukola relay and it is also the owner of the rights to the Jukola event.\n\n==The Youth Jukola relay==\nSince 1986, a Jukola relay event for young orienteers has been organized as a separate event in August each year.

leg]]\n\nThe '''Jukola Relay''' is an [[orienteering]] [[relay race]] held annually in [[Finland]] since 1949. Jukola is the biggest orienteering relay event in the world. The race takes place on a Saturday between the 13th and 19th of June in different sites around Finland. The northernmost location has been 50&nbsp;km north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. The name '''Jukola''' is a family name in the classic [[Finland|Finnish]] novel, \"[[Seven Brothers]]\". The women's relay, known as the '''Venla Relay''', is a daytime race on the Saturday afternoon. It is named after the main female character from the novel.\n\nThe Jukola relay has seven legs with distances varying from 7 to 15&nbsp;km. The starting time is around 11&nbsp;pm when the sun sets. Runners for the first three legs usually wear headlights, depending on the geographical site (north or south of Finland) of the relay and the weather conditions. The winning team crosses the finishing line early on Sunday morning, around 6 or 7&nbsp;am, and the last teams finish just before the finish is closed in the afternoon. Women can participate in the Jukola relay in non-official teams (non-sports club teams, like company, family or other teams).<ref>{{Cite web| title = General information | url = http://www.jukola.com/en/tietoja-tapahtumasta/ | accessdate = 2015-06-15}}</ref>\n\nFor the women, an individual race with a mass start was organized in 1951. This was turned into a three leg relay race in 1978 and then a four leg relay race in 1981. \nIn 2012 the Jukola relay attracted close to 1700 teams and the Venla relay more than 1250. Clubs from 20 different countries took part.\n\nThe \"Kaukamets\u00e4l\u00e4iset\"<ref name=\"Kaukametsalaiset\">{{Cite web| title = Association Kaukamets\u00e4l\u00e4iset | url = http://www.jukola.com/en/kaukametsalaiset-ry/ | accessdate = 2012-03-11}}</ref> association is the founder of the Jukola relay and it is also the owner of the rights to the Jukola event.\n\n==The Youth Jukola relay==\nSince 1986, a Jukola relay event for young orienteers has been organized as a separate event in August each year. The Youth Jukola relay<ref name=\"the youth jukola\">{{Cite web| title = Youth Jukola | url = http://www.jukola.com/en/nuorten-jukola/ | accessdate = 2014-06-20}}</ref> is the world's most attended junior orienteering relay.\n\n==History of Jukola and Venla==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
