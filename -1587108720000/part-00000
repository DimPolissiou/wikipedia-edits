They are happy with each other, but do not believe in tying each other down, so when career beckons they have a mutual break-up but remain friends. Meera goes to [[India]], while Jai stays in London, hoping to be called to [[San Francisco]], where working at the [[Golden Gate]] Inc. is his dream job. Jai begins to date an Swiss girl named Jo (Florence Brudenell-Bruce), while Meera returns the feelings of her boss, Vikram Joshi ([[Rahul Khanna]]). The couple believes they have moved on.\n\nRunning simultaneously, but set in the past, is the tale of Veer Singh Panesar ([[Rishi Kapoor]]). A great believer of love, the Sikh narrates his love story to Jai to try to convince him not to let Meera go from his life. He explains how he fell for a girl named Harleen ([[Giselle Monteiro]]). Jai ridicules Veer, who vowed to marry Harleen before he had even gotten to talk to her. But, on Veer's insistence, he agrees to pay Meera a surprise visit in India. Meera is stunned, and the two lie to both Jo and Vikram to spend time with each other. They realize how much they still like each other's company. Jai and Jo break up as Jai is unable to reciprocate the deeper feelings that Jo longs for. On the day Jai is to leave, Vikram proposes to Meera. She meets Jai secretly, who tells her she should make a decision. Angry, Meera tells him to leave her life or else she will never be able to really move on. Parallel to this, we find that Harleen has told Veer she was engaged without being told, and he must leave her.\n\nJai is called to his dream job in San Francisco the same day that Meera realizes her marriage is a mistake. She tells Vikram the truth and calls Jai, but he tells her about Golden Gate. Realizing he is going to San Francisco, she tells him nothing. Meanwhile, Veer declares his intentions of marrying Harleen but is badly beaten by her family.\n\nJai begins to lose interest in his \"dream job,\" finding that he is not as happy as he thought he would be. He is beaten by some thugs when, while being mugged, he refuses to give them a picture of Meera. He then realizes he still loves her, and goes back to India. He finds Vikram, who informs him that Meera left him. In the past, Veer travels to Harleen's house on the day of her wedding, and convinces her mother that Harleen can only be happy with him. Harleen's mother lets Veer secretly sneak out with her daughter, and the two marry happily. In the present, Jai and Meera have a heart-touching reunion.\n\n<br />\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as Jai Vardhan Singh/Veer Singh Panesar\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Meera Pandit\n* [[Giselli Monteiro]] as Harleen Kaur\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as older Veer Singh Panesar \n*[[Neetu Singh]] as older Harleen Kaur (special appearance)\n* [[Rahul Khanna]] as Vikram Joshi\n* [[Florence Brudenell-Bruce]] as Jo\n* [[Raj Zutshi]] as Harleen's father\n* [[Kavi Shastri]] as Jaat\n* [[Vir Das]] as Shonty\n* Sagar Arya as Jai's friend\n* Mandi Sidhu as Colly\n* Sheena Bhattessa as Neha Singh (Jai's sister)\n* [[Dolly Ahluwalia]] as Harleen's Grandmother\n* Rajiv Nema as [[Bangladeshi]] taxi driver roll\n* [[Amanda Rosario]] as Amanda\n* Himanshu Solanki\n* Ajay Kalyansingh as Guy in church\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe shooting of the film started in May 2008<ref name=\"Deepika un'Saif' choice\">{{cite web|title=Deepika un'Saif' choice\n|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2008/jan/859472.htm|publisher=Mid-Day|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref> and took place at the railway station of [[Patiala]], [[Red Fort]], [[Purana Qila]] and on the streets of [[Delhi]].

They are happy with each other, but do not believe in tying each other down, so when career beckons they have a mutual break-up but remain friends. Meera goes to [[India]], while Jai stays in London, hoping to be called to [[San Francisco]], where working at the [[Golden Gate]] Inc. is his dream job. Jai begins to date an Swiss girl named Jo (Florence Brudenell-Bruce), while Meera returns the feelings of her boss, Vikram Joshi ([[Rahul Khanna]]). The couple believes they have moved on.\n\nRunning simultaneously, but set in the past, is the tale of Veer Singh Panesar ([[Rishi Kapoor]]). A great believer of love, the Sikh narrates his love story to Jai to try to convince him not to let Meera go from his life. He explains how he fell for a girl named Harleen ([[Giselle Monteiro]]). Jai ridicules Veer, who vowed to marry Harleen before he had even gotten to talk to her. But, on Veer's insistence, he agrees to pay Meera a surprise visit in India. Meera is stunned, and the two lie to both Jo and Vikram to spend time with each other. They realize how much they still like each other's company. Jai and Jo break up as Jai is unable to reciprocate the deeper feelings that Jo longs for. On the day Jai is to leave, Vikram proposes to Meera. She meets Jai secretly, who tells her she should make a decision. Angry, Meera tells him to leave her life or else she will never be able to really move on. Parallel to this, we find that Harleen has told Veer she was engaged without being told, and he must leave her.\n\nJai is called to his dream job in San Francisco the same day that Meera realizes her marriage is a mistake. She tells Vikram the truth and calls Jai, but he tells her about Golden Gate. Realizing he is going to San Francisco, she tells him nothing. Meanwhile, Veer declares his intentions of marrying Harleen but is badly beaten by her family.\n\nJai begins to lose interest in his \"dream job,\" finding that he is not as happy as he thought he would be. He is beaten by some thugs when, while being mugged, he refuses to give them a picture of Meera. He then realizes he still loves her, and goes back to India. He finds Vikram, who informs him that Meera left him. In the past, Veer travels to Harleen's house on the day of her wedding, and convinces her mother that Harleen can only be happy with him. Harleen's mother lets Veer secretly sneak out with her daughter, and the two marry happily. In the present, Jai and Meera have a heart-touching reunion.\n\n<br />\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as Jai Vardhan Singh/Veer Singh Panesar\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Meera Pandit\n* [[Giselli Monteiro]] as Harleen Kaur\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as older Veer Singh Panesar \n*[[Neetu Singh]] as older Harleen Kaur (special appearance)\n* [[Rahul Khanna]] as Vikram Joshi\n* [[Florence Brudenell-Bruce]] as Jo\n* [[Raj Zutshi]] as Harleen's father\n* [[Kavi Shastri]] as Jaat\n* [[Vir Das]] as Shonty\n* Sagar Arya as Jai's friend\n* Mandi Sidhu as Colly\n* Sheena Bhattessa as Neha Singh (Jai's sister)\n* [[Dolly Ahluwalia]] as Harleen's Grandmother\n* Rajiv Nema as [[Bangladeshi]] taxi driver roll\n* [[Amanda Rosario]] as Amanda\n* Himanshu Solanki\n* Ajay Kalyansingh as Guy in church\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe shooting of the film started in May 2008<ref name=\"Deepika un'Saif' choice\">{{cite web|title=Deepika un'Saif' choice\n|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2008/jan/859472.htm|publisher=Mid-Day|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref> and took place at the railway station of [[Patiala]], [[Red Fort]], [[Purana Qila]] and on the streets of [[Delhi]].

She goes into the pool, lying on a float, while looking at the camera and singing.The camera then switches to other residents in the trailer park and their activities, including Mayfield dancing, Hart weightlifting a [[boombox]] and Cox watering her yard of [[plastic flamingo]]es and greeting Lockhart, who promptly faints.\n\nThe scene cuts to Swift walking and dancing down a street with Hall, interspersed with scenes of Kiyoko shooting an arrow into a target with the number \"5\" (a clue to Swift's next promotional single \"[[The Archer (song)|The Archer]]\", the fifth track on the album), protestors holding placards with anti-gay slogans (a reference to a real-life religious group that picketed Swift's concerts),<ref name=\"VogueCover2019\"/> Ciara officiating a wedding between Ferguson and Mikita, and Rippon serving [[snow cone]]s to customers from a stall. Swift also holds a tea party with the Fab Five and Hall. In another trailer, Lambert tattoos the words \"Cruel Summer\" (later revealed to be a song on the album) onto DeGeneres' right arm. In the next scene, Swift and other residents [[sun tanning|sun tan]] while ignoring the heckling protestors, followed by Porter walking down the middle of the two crowds wearing a dress.\n\nThe scene shifts to a \"pop queen pageant\" with the contestants dressed as numerous female singers. RuPaul walks down the lineup with a crown decorated with [[emerald]]s and [[fleur-de-lis]] motifs,<ref name=\"VultureJG\"/> but instead of crowning a winner, he throws it in the air. A food fight begins, with Swift appearing in a french fries costume and Perry in a hamburger suit. The two see and walk towards each other. Elsewhere, Reynolds is portraying [[Norman Rockwell]] works on a painting of the [[Stonewall Inn]].<ref name=\"VultureJG\"/><ref name=\"IndiewireJD\"/> Swift and Perry smile, dance and share a hug.

He soon returned to comics. He started out by imitating the work of his favorite author, [[Herg\u00e9]], creating [[pastiches]] of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''. These copies were illegal and did not earn him much money, though this allowed him to meet many other cartoonists, like [[Bob de Moor]], [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Greg (comics)|Michel \"Greg\" Regnier]]. In 1995, he met Daniel and Richard Houde, and in their magazine ''Pignouf'' he started his comic series ''Pignouf et Hamlet'', about a boy and his pig. The magazine only lasted for five issues, though the series continued.\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== The ''Tintin'' Pastiches ===\nRodier always had a passion for ''The Adventures of Tintin'' by Herg\u00e9 and so he embarked on writing some ''Tintin'' stories of his own. These are ''Tintin ''pastiches, meaning that they try to imitate the style of Herg\u00e9. They are illegal, as they breach the ''Tintin'' copyright owned by the [[Herg\u00e9 Foundation]] (Moulinsart), but some have been published, and they are all found circulating on the Internet.\n\n====''Tintin and Alph-Art''====\nThe unfinished Tintin book ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'' was unofficially completed by Rodier in black-and-white. Several groups have coloured it, such as 'Alph-junis', and have translated it into English. It was published in Autumn 1986 and then presented to Moulinsart. Rodier asked that it become an official book but Moulinsart refused. In 1991, Rodier met [[Bob de Moor]], and together they asked for permission to re-draw the book. Moulinsart still disagreed and De Moor died in 1992. Rodier later re-drew certain parts of it to make them more akin to the style of Herg\u00e9. It was only released on CD-ROM, as opposed to being printed like the other edition.\n\n====''A Day at the Airport''====\nHerg\u00e9 once suggested that a good idea for his next Tintin story would be to set it in an airport. However, he chose to set it in the art world instead and partially produced ''Tintin and Alph-art''.  Rodier started out a new book called ''A Day at the Airport'' though it was abandoned, with the first page leaking onto the web. The plot involves a character from the Tintin stories, [[General Alcazar]], being shot, apparently by [[Dr. M\u00fcller]], a villain from the Tintin series.\n\n====''Tintin in Tibet'' page 27b====\nRodier also did an extra page for Herg\u00e9's ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' which Herg\u00e9 deleted from his comic.\n\n====Tintin, Freelance reporter for ''Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me''====\nThe origin of the story lies in a scenario for a drawing contest in the ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Journal de Spirou]]'' number 1027, from December 19, 1957.\nTwenty years later, Yves Rodier used the story for another drawing contest, converted it as a Tintin plot and drew 6 half-pages of a story that takes place right before \"Tintin and The soviets\". Those pages explains how Tintin gets the job as a reporter. \nFor the story Rodier didn't win the contest as he was disqualified for using already existing characters.\n\n====The Witches Lake====\nThis seven-page story was entirely thought up by Rodier and is sometimes called ''The Sorcerers Lake''. It is about a monster in the local lake and is set before ''Tintin in Tibet''.\n\n====Tintin et le Thermoz\u00e9ro====\nYves Rodier's version of ''[[Le Thermoz\u00e9ro]]'' is an inking from page 4 of sketches made from Herg\u00e9.\n\n===Pignouf and Hamlet===\nThe stories of a boy and his pig.

It was named after [[\u00c1brah\u00e1m Ganz]], the founder and the manager of the company. It is probably best known for the manufacture of [[tramcars]], but was also a pioneer in the application of [[Three-phase AC railway electrification|three-phase alternating current to electric railways]]. Ganz also made ships (''Ganz Danubius''), bridge steel structures (''Ganz Ac\u00e9lszerkezet'') and high-voltage equipment (''Ganz Transelektro''). In the early 20th century the company experienced its heyday, it became the third largest industrial enterprise in Kingdom of Hungary after the ''[[Manfr\u00e9d Weiss Steel and Metal Works]]'' and the ''[[M\u00c1VAG]]'' company. Since 1989, various parts of ''Ganz'' have been taken over by other companies.\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1919, the company built [[ocean liners]], [[dreadnought]] type [[battleship]]s and [[submarine]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[automobile]]s<ref>Iv\u00e1n Boldizs\u00e1r: NHQ; the ''New Hungarian Quarterly'', Volume 16, Issue 2; Volume 16, Issues 59\u201360, p. 128</ref><ref>Hungarian Technical Abstracts: Magyar M\u0171szaki Lapszemle, Volumes 10\u201313, p. 41</ref> and many types of fighter aircraft.<ref>[[Iv\u00e1n T. Berend]]: ''Case Studies on Modern European Economy: Entrepreneurship, Inventions, and Institutions'', p. 151</ref>\n\nThe company was founded by ''Abraham Ganz'' in 1844. He was invited to [[Pest, Hungary]], by Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] and became the casting master at the ''Roller Mill Plant'' (referred to as ''Hengermalom'' in Hungarian). In&nbsp;1854 he began manufacturing hard cast [[railroad wheel]]s in his own plant founded in 1844.  He successfully developed a [[railway wheel|railway whee]]l [[casting]] technology; it was the new method of \"crust-casting\" to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to the rapid railway development in Central Europe. 86,074 pieces of hard cast wheels had been sold to 59 European railway companies until 1866. Consequently, this factory played an important role in building the infrastructure of the Hungarian Kingdom and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} At this time the [[agricultural machine]]s, [[steam locomotive]]s, pumps and the [[railway carriage]]s were the main products.

Loads were to be connected in parallel, not in series as had been the general practice until 1885. Additionally, the inventors described the closed armature as an essential part of the transformer. Both factors assisted the stabilisation of voltage under varying load, and allowed definition of standard voltages for distribution and loads. The parallel connection and efficient closed core made construction of electrical distribution systems technically and economically feasible.\n\nThe Ganz Works built the first transformers using iron plating of enamelled mild iron wire, and started to use laminated cores to eliminate [[eddy currents]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Electrical Society of Cornell University|title=Proceedings of the Electrical Society of [[Cornell University]]|publisher=Andrus & Church|year=1896|page=39}}</ref>\n\n==== AC Power stations ====\nIn 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the company supplied, electrical equipment for the world's first [[power station]] to use AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network.

In 1894, Hungarian engineer K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 developed high-voltage [[Three-phase AC railway electrification|three-phase AC motors and generators]] for [[electric locomotive]]s. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made [[Induction motor|asynchronous]] rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]] (France) with a 37 HP asynchronous traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender for electrification of the [[Valtellina]] Railway in Italy in 1897. Under the management, and on the basis of plans from K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3, three phase electric power at 3 kV and 15&nbsp;Hz was fed through two upper wires and the rails. The electricity was produced in a dedicated power station and the system operated for thirty years from 1902. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106&nbsp;km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kand\u00f3 and a team from the Ganz works.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=120-121}}<ref name=\"Patent Office\" /> The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices.<ref name=\"Kalman Kando2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/kando_k.htm|title=Kalman Kando|accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://profiles.incredible-people.com/kalman-kando/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712234334/http://profiles.incredible-people.com/kalman-kando/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Kalman Kando |accessdate=2009-12-05 }}</ref> The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as \"the Italian system\".

Jendrassik had also designed a small-scale 75&nbsp;kW turboprop in 1937.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==After World War II==\nIn 1947, the Ganz Works was nationalised and in 1949 it became independent and six big companies came into existence, including the Ganz Transformer Factory. In 1959, Ganz Wagon and Machine Factory merged with the [[M\u00c1VAG]] Locomotive and Machine Factory under the name of Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Locomotive, Wagon and Machine Works. Of the products of the Works, outstanding results were shown in the field of the manufacture of [[diesel railcar]]s and [[multiple unit]]s. Traditional products included [[tram]]cars as well, and customers included the tramway network of Budapest. In the meantime the Foundry workshop was closed down.\n\nIn 1974, the locomotive and wagon Works were merged under the name of Railway Vehicle Factory and then the machine construction branch went through significant development. The production of industrial and apartment house [[Elevator|lifts]] became a new branch. Ganz-M\u00c1VAG took over a lot of smaller plants in the 1960s and 1970s and their product range was extended. Among other things, they increased their bridge-building capacity. They made iron structures for several [[Tisza]] bridges, for the [[Elisabeth Bridge (Budapest)|Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge]] in Budapest, for public road bridges in Yugoslavia and for several industrial halls.\n\nThe Ganz Shipyard experienced its most productive times during the four decades following nationalisation. In the course of this period 1100 ship units were produced, the number of completed seagoing ships was 240 and that of floating cranes was 663. As a result of the great economic and social crises of the 1980s, Ganz-M\u00c1VAG had to be reorganised. The company was transformed into seven independent Works and three [[joint venture]]s.\n\n==Ganz since 1989==\nIn 1989, the British company Telfos Holdings gained a majority of the shares in Ganz Railway Vehicle Factory Co. Ltd. and the name of the company was changed to Ganz-Hunslet Co. Ltd. In the course of 1991 and 1992, the Austrian company [[Jenbacher Werke]] obtained 100% of the company's shares and consequently the railway vehicle factory is now a member of the international railway vehicle manufacturing group, Jenbacher Transport Systeme. At present, the Ganz Electric Works, under the name of Ganz-Ansaldo is a member of the Italian industrial giant, [[AnsaldoBreda]]. The Ganz Works were transformed into holdings.

It was named after [[\u00c1brah\u00e1m Ganz]], the founder and the manager of the company. It is probably best known for the manufacture of [[tramcars]], but was also a pioneer in the application of [[Three-phase AC railway electrification|three-phase alternating current to electric railways]]. Ganz also made ships (''Ganz Danubius''), bridge steel structures (''Ganz Ac\u00e9lszerkezet'') and high-voltage equipment (''Ganz Transelektro''). In the early 20th century the company experienced its heyday, it became the third largest industrial enterprise in Kingdom of Hungary after the ''[[Manfr\u00e9d Weiss Steel and Metal Works]]'' and the ''[[M\u00c1VAG]]'' company. Since 1989, various parts of ''Ganz'' have been taken over by other companies.\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1919, the company built [[ocean liners]], [[dreadnought]] type [[battleship]]s and [[submarine]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[automobile]]s<ref>Iv\u00e1n Boldizs\u00e1r: NHQ; the ''New Hungarian Quarterly'', Volume 16, Issue 2; Volume 16, Issues 59\u201360, p. 128</ref><ref>Hungarian Technical Abstracts: Magyar M\u0171szaki Lapszemle, Volumes 10\u201313, p. 41</ref> and many types of fighter aircraft.<ref>[[Iv\u00e1n T.

He was invited to [[Pest, Hungary]], by Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] and became the casting master at the ''Roller Mill Plant'' (referred to as ''Hengermalom'' in Hungarian). In&nbsp;1854 he began manufacturing hard cast [[railroad wheel]]s in his own plant founded in 1844.  He successfully developed a [[railway wheel|railway whee]]l [[casting]] technology; it was the new method of \"crust-casting\" to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to the rapid railway development in Central Europe. 86,074 pieces of hard cast wheels had been sold to 59 European railway companies until 1866. Consequently, this factory played an important role in building the infrastructure of the Hungarian Kingdom and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} At this time the [[agricultural machine]]s, [[steam locomotive]]s, pumps and the [[railway carriage]]s were the main products. At the beginning of the 20th century, 60 to 80% of the factory's products were sold for export.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the products of the ''Ganz and Partner Iron Mill and Machine Factory'' (hereinafter referred to as ''Ganz Works'') promoted the expansion of [[alternating-current]] [[power transmission]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Prominent engineers===\n\nProminent engineers at ''Ganz works'' included [[Andr\u00e1s Mechwart]], [[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]], [[Ott\u00f3 Titusz Bl\u00e1thy]], [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]] and [[Ern\u0151 Wilczek]].\n\n===Revolution in the milling industry===\nThe invention of the modern industrial mill (the [[roller mill]] ) \u2013 by [[Andr\u00e1s Mechwart]] in 1874 \u2013 guaranteed a solid technological superiority and revolutionized the world's milling industry.

Loads were to be connected in parallel, not in series as had been the general practice until 1885. Additionally, the inventors described the closed armature as an essential part of the transformer. Both factors assisted the stabilisation of voltage under varying load, and allowed definition of standard voltages for distribution and loads. The parallel connection and efficient closed core made construction of electrical distribution systems technically and economically feasible.\n\nThe Ganz Works built the first transformers using iron plating of enamelled mild iron wire, and started to use laminated cores to eliminate [[eddy currents]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Electrical Society of Cornell University|title=Proceedings of the Electrical Society of [[Cornell University]]|publisher=Andrus & Church|year=1896|page=39}}</ref>\n\n==== Power stations ====\nIn 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the company supplied, electrical equipment for the world's first [[power station]] to use AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network.

In 1894, Hungarian engineer K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 developed high-voltage [[Three-phase AC railway electrification|three-phase AC motors and generators]] for [[electric locomotive]]s. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made [[Induction motor|asynchronous]] rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]] (France) with a 37 HP asynchronous traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender for electrification of the [[Valtellina]] Railway in Italy in 1897. Under the management, and on the basis of plans from K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3, three phase electric power at 3 kV and 15&nbsp;Hz was fed through two upper wires and the rails. The electricity was produced in a dedicated power station and the system operated for thirty years from 1902. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106&nbsp;km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kand\u00f3 and a team from the Ganz works.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=120-121}}<ref name=\"Patent Office\" /> The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices.<ref name=\"Kalman Kando2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/kando_k.htm|title=Kalman Kando|accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://profiles.incredible-people.com/kalman-kando/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712234334/http://profiles.incredible-people.com/kalman-kando/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Kalman Kando |accessdate=2009-12-05 }}</ref> The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as \"the Italian system\".

Maj|Danubius shipbuilding company]], which was the largest shipbuilding company in Hungary. From 1911, the unified company adopted the ''\"Ganz\u2013Danubius''\" brand name.\nAs Ganz Danubius, the company became involved in shipbuilding before, and during, [[World War I]]. Ganz was responsible for building the dreadnought {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}}, all of the [[Novara-class cruiser|''Novara''-class cruiser]]s, and built diesel-electric [[U-boat]]s at its shipyard in Budapest, for final assembly at [[Fiume]]. Several U-boats of the [[Austro-Hungarian submarine U-XXIX|U-XXIX class]], [[Austro-Hungarian submarine U-XXX|U-XXX class]], [[Austro-Hungarian submarine U-XXXI|U-XXXI class]] and [[Austro-Hungarian submarine U-XXXII|U-XXXII class]] were completed,<ref>{{cite book|author=R.H.

During World War I, the company made many types of [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] and [[Fokker]] fighter planes.\n\nThe world's first [[turboprop]] engine was the [[Jendrassik Cs-1]] designed by the Hungarian mechanical engineer [[Gy\u00f6rgy Jendrassik]]. It was built and tested in the Ganz factory in Budapest between 1939 and 1942. It was planned to be fitted to the Varga RMI-1 X/H twin-engined reconnaissance bomber designed by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Varga in 1940, but the program was cancelled. Jendrassik had also designed a small-scale 75&nbsp;kW turboprop in 1937.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==After World War II==\nIn 1947, the Ganz Works was nationalised and in 1949 it became independent and six big companies came into existence, including the Ganz Transformer Factory. In 1959, Ganz Wagon and Machine Factory merged with the [[M\u00c1VAG]] Locomotive and Machine Factory under the name of Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Locomotive, Wagon and Machine Works. Of the products of the Works, outstanding results were shown in the field of the manufacture of [[diesel railcar]]s and [[multiple unit]]s. Traditional products included [[tram]]cars as well, and customers included the tramway network of Budapest. In the meantime the Foundry workshop was closed down.\n\nIn 1974, the locomotive and wagon Works were merged under the name of Railway Vehicle Factory and then the machine construction branch went through significant development. The production of industrial and apartment house [[Elevator|lifts]] became a new branch. Ganz-M\u00c1VAG took over a lot of smaller plants in the 1960s and 1970s and their product range was extended. Among other things, they increased their bridge-building capacity. They made iron structures for several [[Tisza]] bridges, for the [[Elisabeth Bridge (Budapest)|Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge]] in Budapest, for public road bridges in Yugoslavia and for several industrial halls.\n\nThe Ganz Shipyard experienced its most productive times during the four decades following nationalisation. In the course of this period 1100 ship units were produced, the number of completed seagoing ships was 240 and that of floating cranes was 663. As a result of the great economic and social crises of the 1980s, Ganz-M\u00c1VAG had to be reorganised. The company was transformed into seven independent Works and three [[joint venture]]s.\n\n==Ganz since 1989==\nIn 1989, the British company Telfos Holdings gained a majority of the shares in Ganz Railway Vehicle Factory Co. Ltd. and the name of the company was changed to Ganz-Hunslet Co. Ltd. In the course of 1991 and 1992, the Austrian company [[Jenbacher Werke]] obtained 100% of the company's shares and consequently the railway vehicle factory is now a member of the international railway vehicle manufacturing group, Jenbacher Transport Systeme. At present, the Ganz Electric Works, under the name of Ganz-Ansaldo is a member of the Italian industrial giant, [[AnsaldoBreda]]. The Ganz Works were transformed into holdings. Ganz-Danubius was wound up in 1994. The Ganz Electric Meter Factory in G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 became the member of the international Schlumberger group.\n\nIn 2006, the power transmission and distribution sectors of Ganz Transelektro were acquired by [[Crompton Greaves]],<ref>[http://www.ganztrans.hu/index.php?fooldal=1 Ganz is now CG] Retrieved 2009-11-28.</ref> but still doing business under the Ganz brand name, while the unit dealing with electric traction (propulsion and control systems for electric vehicles) was acquired by [[\u0160koda Transportation]] and is now a part of [[\u0160koda Electric]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skoda.cz/ganz-skoda|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413005712/http://www.skoda.cz/ganz-skoda|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 April 2008|title=\u010cesk\u00e1 verze \u2013 \u0160KODA TRANSPORTATION a.s.|first=Lundegaard \u2013 e-business solutions provider, www.lundegaard.cz|last=info@lundegaard.cz|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ganz|Ganz Works}}\n*[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/Gov11_01Rail-fig-Gov11_01Rail038a.html A photo of a Ganz railcar of Hungarian State Railways c1936]\n*[http://vaunut.org/kuvasivu.php/30033 A withdrawn Ganz-Mavag DMU at Mendoza, Argentina]\n*[http://www.ganztrans.hu/index.php?fooldal=1 Ganz Transelektro Ltd's page in english]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090322023622/http://www.gdvitla.hu/english.php Ganz Danubius homepage]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ganz Company}}\n[[Category:Ganz Works| ]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Rail vehicle manufacturers of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Tram manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Companies of Austria-Hungary]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of Austria-Hungary]]\n[[Category:Shipbuilding companies of Austria-Hungary]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1844]]\n[[Category:1844 establishments in the Austrian Empire]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering companies]]\n", "name_user": "Liltender", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePower stations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganz_Works"}
