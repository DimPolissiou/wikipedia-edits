{"title_page": "History of Canada", "text_new": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{History of Canada sidebar}}\nThe '''history of Canada''' covers the period from the arrival of [[Paleo-Indians]] thousands of years ago to the present day. Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing present-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates.<ref>Dawson (1958) ch 14, 15</ref> The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, [[Thomas Crerar]], resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid [[Robert Forke]]. The socialist reformer [[J.&nbsp;S. Woodsworth]] gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.<ref>Bruce Hutchison, ''The Incredible Canadian'' (1952), pp. 76\u201378.</ref>\n\nIn 1926 Prime Minister Mackenzie King advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Julian H.G.

Wages fell as did prices. Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts became heavier as prices fell.

He says the:\n:interpretive schemes that dominated Canadian historical writing through the middle decades of the twentieth century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on the wrong track. They lost because they ''had'' to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.<ref>Allan Greer, \"1837\u201338: Rebellion reconsidered\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1995) 76#1 pp 1\u201318, quotation on page 3.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Canada provinces map|border=none|align=right|prefix =History of|the=the|map=Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|caption=History by province or territory}}\n*{{Portal-inline|Canada}}\n* ''[[Canada's Story]]''\n* [[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)]]\n* [[Heritage Minutes]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[History of Canadian women]]\n* [[History of Canadian sports]]\n* [[History of Education in Canada]]\n* [[History Trek]], Canadian History web portal designed for children\n* [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]\n* [[Persons of National Historic Significance]]\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{main|Bibliography of Canadian history}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* For an annotated bibliography and evaluation of major books, see  ''Canada: A Reader\u2019s Guide,'' (2nd ed., 2000) by J.

Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing present-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

Bees are non-aggressive in this state, since they have no hive to protect.]]\nUnlike most other bee species, western honey bees have [[perennial]] [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered [[superorganism]]s. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]\".<ref name=\"caron\">{{Cite book|title=Honey bee biology and beekeeping|last=Caron, Dewey M. (Dewey Maurice)|date=2013|publisher=Wicas Press|others=Connor, Lawrence John.|isbn=9781878075291|edition= Revised |location=Kalamazoo, MI|oclc=869287399}}</ref>\n\nIn most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the [[pupa]]l stages of these \"daughter queens\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \"piping\", just prior to emerging as adults,<ref>{{YouTube|VBlI1sgczVY|Piping Queens After a Swarm}}</ref> and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.\n\nOnce she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile [[female]], lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of [[haplodiploidy]]). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more [[nuptial flight]]s, each time mating with 1\u201317 drones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Robert E.|title=The Evolution of Multiple Mating Behavior by Honey Bee Queens (Apis mellifera L.)|journal=Genetics|date=1980|pages=253\u2013273|pmc=1214294|pmid=7203010|volume=96|issue=1}}</ref> Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.\n\nThroughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees.  Nectar from flowers is processed by [[worker bee]]s, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into [[honey]], which can then be capped over with [[Beeswax|wax]] and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again.  This is probably triggered by [[day length]]. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.\n\n===Individual bee life cycle===\n[[File:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Full (with larvae) and empty (with eggs) honeycomb cells|Larvae (''left'') and eggs (''right'')]]\nLike other insects that undergo [[holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: [[egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]] and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single [[egg]] into each cell of a [[honeycomb]] prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \"nurse\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \"[[brood (honey bee)|brood]]\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.\n\nWorker bees secrete the [[Beeswax|wax]] used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed [[Laying worker bee|they may lay]] fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with [[Drone (bee)|drones]] and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.\n\nQueens and workers have a modified [[ovipositor]] called a ''[[Stinger (organ)|stinger]]'', with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species, the stinger of worker western honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a [[human]] or other [[mammal]]. The stinger and its [[venom sac]], with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering [[venom]] after they are detached, are designed to [[Autotomy|pull free of the body]] when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \"catch\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).<ref name=caron/>\n\nAlthough the [[Life expectancy|average lifespan]] of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the [[European dark bee|German honey bee]] subspecies (''A. m. mellifera'') previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Apis_mellifera |title=''Apis mellifera'' |work=AnAge database |publisher=Human Ageing Genomic Resources |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> Because a queen's store of [[sperm]] is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.\n\nThe lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer work hard, and live only a few weeks, but those born in autumn remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about 1% of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.<ref>Tautz, J.

She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queen larva are both fed [[royal jelly]], which is high in protein and low in [[flavonoid]], during the first three days. After that, workers are switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \"bee bread\"), while queens continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavonoid and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mao |first1=Wenfu |last2=Schuler |first2=Mary A. |last3=Berenbaum |first3=May R. |title=A dietary phytochemical alters caste-associated gene expression in honey bees |journal=Science Advances |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=7 |page=e1500795 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500795|pmid=26601244 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0795M |pmc=4643792 }}</ref>\u2014a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.\n\nPeriodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:\n# The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.\n# The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in [[Honey bee pheromones#Types of queen honeybee pheromones|queen pheromones]] throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at its end, the old queen is usually killed.\n# The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and try to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.\nRegardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.\n\n[[File:Queencell 0017.JPG |thumb|right |alt=See caption |Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb]]\nQueens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones, known as queen scent.\n\nAfter several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point&nbsp;\u2013 a site near a clearing and generally about {{convert |30 |ft |m}} above the ground&nbsp;\u2013 where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \"dummy\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her [[spermatheca]] is full.\n\nThe queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).\n\nShe fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.\n\n=== Workers ===\nWorkers are females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, [[diploid]] eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.\n\n===Drones===\n\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 81b.jpg |thumb|right |alt=Top and bottom views of a developing pupa against a honeycomb |Development of a drone pupa]]\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 79d.jpg |thumb|right |alt=White and brown pupae filling cells |Pupae of drones]]\n\n{{Main |Drone (bee)}}\n\nDrones are the colony's [[male]] bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to [[fertilization|fertilize]] a new queen. Many drones mate with a given queen in flight; each dies immediately after mating, since the process of [[insemination]] requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are [[haploid]] (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions, drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. Given their larger size (1.5 times that of worker bees), inside the hive it is believed that drones may play a significant role in [[thermoregulation]]. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain [[sperm viability]], which may be compromised at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below {{Convert|25|C|}} their ability to contribute declines.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=J H |title=Roles of individual honeybee workers and drones in colonial thermogenesis |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1 May 1987 |volume=129 |page=60 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/129/1/53.full.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2014|pmid=3585245 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Queen-Worker Conflict}}Queen-worker conflict==\n{{Main|Worker policing}}\nWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones decreases the overall productivity of the hive, it increases the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barron | first1 = A. | last2 = Oldroyd | first2 = B | last3 = Ratnieks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Worker reproduction in honey-bees (Apis) and the anarchic syndrome: a review | url = | journal = Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 199\u2013208 | doi = 10.1007/s002650100362 }}</ref>\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, if the queen dies or is removed, reproduction in workers increases because a significant proportion of workers then have activated ovaries.

In that case, workers are related by three-quarters of their genes, and the sons of workers are [[Coefficient of relationship|related]] more than usual to sons of the queen. Then the benefit of policing is negated. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social [[hymenoptera]].<ref>Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A.

From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight and stopping flight for additional shivering, passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and [[evaporative cooling]] from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernd Heinrich |year=1996 |title=How the honey bee regulates its body temperature |journal=[[Bee World]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=130\u2013137 |url=http://www.ibra.org.uk/articles/20100224_2|doi=10.1080/0005772X.1996.11099304 }}</ref>\n\nThe optimal air temperature for [[Forage (honey bee)|foraging]] is {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}}.

[[Karl von Frisch]], who received the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his study of honey bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive.<ref name=\"Capinera2008\">{{cite book|author=John L.

Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within {{convert|50|m}} of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their [[Olfaction|olfactory sense]] to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Unlike western honey bees, the [[Apis florea|dwarf honey bee]] does not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beekman|first=Madeleine|displayauthors=etal|title=Dance Precision of Apis florea\u2014Clues to the Evolution of the Honeybee Dance Language?|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=8|year=2008|pages=1259\u20131265|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0554-z}}</ref> Therefore, western honey bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that the former are more evolved than the latter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biewer|first1=Matthias|last2=Schlesinger|first2=Francisca|last3=Hasselmann|first3=Martin|title=The evolutionary dynamics of major regulators for sexual development among Hymenoptera species|journal=Frontiers in Genetics|date=10 April 2015|volume=6|pages=124|doi=10.3389/fgene.2015.00124|pmc=4392698|pmid=25914717}}</ref>\n\nAnother means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsoventrally]] while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92% of observed shaking signals and 64% of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71% of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.\n\n====Pheromones====\n{{Main|Honey bee pheromones}}\nPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey bee survival.

They argue that western honey bees are able to survive without human help, and in fact require to \"be left at liberty\" to survive. Further, they argue that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants.

Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a [[superorganism]]).\n\nWestern honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to [[honey]], which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of [[digestive enzyme]]s and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Western honey bees also collect [[pollen]] which, after being processed to [[Bee pollen|bee bread]], supplies protein and fat for the [[Brood (honey bee)|bee brood]] to grow. Centuries of [[selective breeding]] by humans have created western honey bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.\n\n[[File:Western Honey Bees and Honeycomb Closeup.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Many honey bees on a comb|Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper]]\n\nBeekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]]: [[skep]]s, [[Langstroth hive]]s, [[top-bar hive]]s, [[box hive]]s, [[log gum]]s, D. E. hives, and miller hives.<ref name=caron/> All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).\n\nIn cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of [[Diseases of the honey bee#Nosema|dysentery]] and causes an excessive buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] from the bees' [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon dioxide dispersal.\n\n====Products====\n\n[[File:Western honey bee (Apis mellifera).webm|thumb|Western honey bee in a park in Tokyo]] \n[[File:Pumpkin pollination4365.jpg|thumb|alt=Beehives in a planted field|Beehives set up for pollination]]\n[[File:Bee on crocus.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Bee collecting pollen from a blue crocus|Video of western honey bee collecting pollen from blue crocuses]]\n[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|alt=Bee in flight, carrying pollen in a yellow container large for its size|Western honey bee carrying pollen in a [[Pollen basket|basket]] back to the hive]]\n\n====Honey bees====\nHoney bees are one of the products of a beehive. They can be purchased as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen along with two to five pounds (0.91 to 2.27&nbsp;kg) of honey bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood), or as full colonies. Commerce of western honey bees dates back to as early as 1622, when the first colonies of bees were shipped from England to Virginia. Modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date back to the late 1800s. Honey was extracted by killing off the hive, and bees and bee products were mainly an object of local trade. The first commercial beekeeper in the United States is considered Moses Quinby of New York, who experimented with movable box hives, which allow extraction without killing the hive. The improvements in roads and motor vehicles after World War I allowed commercial beekeepers to expand the size of their businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beesource.com/resources/usda/history-of-beekeeping-in-the-united-states/|title=History of Beekeeping in the United States {{!}} Beesource Beekeeping|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Pollination====\n[[File:M\u00e9h (2).jpg|thumb|Western honey bee pollinating a flower]]\n{{Main|Pollination management|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\n\nThe western honey bee is an important [[pollinator]] of crops; this service accounts for much of the species' commercial value.

In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to overwinter sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes.\n\nIn [[California]], [[almond]] pollination occurs in February, early in the [[growing season]] before local hives have built up their populations. Almond [[orchard]]s require two hives per acre, or {{Convert|2000|m2||abbr=on|adj=}} per hive, for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. [[Almond#Pollination|Almond pollination]] (in February and March in the U.S.) is the largest [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country.

Bees are non-aggressive in this state, since they have no hive to protect.]]\nUnlike most other bee species, western honey bees have [[perennial]] [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered [[superorganism]]s. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]\".<ref name=\"caron\">{{Cite book|title=Honey bee biology and beekeeping|last=Caron, Dewey M. (Dewey Maurice)|date=2013|publisher=Wicas Press|others=Connor, Lawrence John.|isbn=9781878075291|edition= Revised |location=Kalamazoo, MI|oclc=869287399}}</ref>\n\nIn most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the [[pupa]]l stages of these \"daughter queens\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \"piping\", just prior to emerging as adults,<ref>{{YouTube|VBlI1sgczVY|Piping Queens After a Swarm}}</ref> and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.\n\nOnce she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile [[female]], lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of [[haplodiploidy]]). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more [[nuptial flight]]s, each time mating with 1\u201317 drones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Robert E.|title=The Evolution of Multiple Mating Behavior by Honey Bee Queens (Apis mellifera L.)|journal=Genetics|date=1980|pages=253\u2013273|pmc=1214294|pmid=7203010|volume=96|issue=1}}</ref> Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.\n\nThroughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees.  Nectar from flowers is processed by [[worker bee]]s, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into [[honey]], which can then be capped over with [[Beeswax|wax]] and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again.  This is probably triggered by [[day length]]. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.\n\n===Individual bee life cycle===\n[[File:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Full (with larvae) and empty (with eggs) honeycomb cells|Larvae (''left'') and eggs (''right'')]]\nLike other insects that undergo [[holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: [[egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]] and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single [[egg]] into each cell of a [[honeycomb]] prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \"nurse\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \"[[brood (honey bee)|brood]]\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.\n\nWorker bees secrete the [[Beeswax|wax]] used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed [[Laying worker bee|they may lay]] fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with [[Drone (bee)|drones]] and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.\n\nQueens and workers have a modified [[ovipositor]] called a ''[[Stinger (organ)|stinger]]'', with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species, the stinger of worker western honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a [[human]] or other [[mammal]]. The stinger and its [[venom sac]], with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering [[venom]] after they are detached, are designed to [[Autotomy|pull free of the body]] when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \"catch\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).<ref name=caron/>\n\nAlthough the [[Life expectancy|average lifespan]] of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the [[European dark bee|German honey bee]] subspecies (''A. m. mellifera'') previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Apis_mellifera |title=''Apis mellifera'' |work=AnAge database |publisher=Human Ageing Genomic Resources |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> Because a queen's store of [[sperm]] is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.\n\nThe lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer work hard, and live only a few weeks, but those born in autumn remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about 1% of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.<ref>Tautz, J.

She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queen larva are both fed [[royal jelly]], which is high in protein and low in [[flavonoid]], during the first three days. After that, workers are switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \"bee bread\"), while queens continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavonoid and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mao |first1=Wenfu |last2=Schuler |first2=Mary A. |last3=Berenbaum |first3=May R. |title=A dietary phytochemical alters caste-associated gene expression in honey bees |journal=Science Advances |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=7 |page=e1500795 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500795|pmid=26601244 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0795M |pmc=4643792 }}</ref>\u2014a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.\n\nPeriodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:\n# The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.\n# The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in [[Honey bee pheromones#Types of queen honeybee pheromones|queen pheromones]] throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at its end, the old queen is usually killed.\n# The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and try to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.\nRegardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.\n\n[[File:Queencell 0017.JPG |thumb|right |alt=See caption |Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb]]\nQueens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones, known as queen scent.\n\nAfter several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point&nbsp;\u2013 a site near a clearing and generally about {{convert |30 |ft |m}} above the ground&nbsp;\u2013 where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \"dummy\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her [[spermatheca]] is full.\n\nThe queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).\n\nShe fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.\n\n=== Workers ===\nWorkers are females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, [[diploid]] eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.\n\n===Drones===\n\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 81b.jpg |thumb|right |alt=Top and bottom views of a developing pupa against a honeycomb |Development of a drone pupa]]\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 79d.jpg |thumb|right |alt=White and brown pupae filling cells |Pupae of drones]]\n\n{{Main |Drone (bee)}}\n\nDrones are the colony's [[male]] bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to [[fertilization|fertilize]] a new queen. Many drones mate with a given queen in flight; each dies immediately after mating, since the process of [[insemination]] requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are [[haploid]] (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions, drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. Given their larger size (1.5 times that of worker bees), inside the hive it is believed that drones may play a significant role in [[thermoregulation]]. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain [[sperm viability]], which may be compromised at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below {{Convert|25|C|}} their ability to contribute declines.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=J H |title=Roles of individual honeybee workers and drones in colonial thermogenesis |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1 May 1987 |volume=129 |page=60 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/129/1/53.full.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2014|pmid=3585245 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Queen-Worker Conflict}}Queen-worker conflict==\n{{Main|Worker policing}}\nWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones decreases the overall productivity of the hive, it increases the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barron | first1 = A. | last2 = Oldroyd | first2 = B | last3 = Ratnieks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Worker reproduction in honey-bees (Apis) and the anarchic syndrome: a review | url = | journal = Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 199\u2013208 | doi = 10.1007/s002650100362 }}</ref>\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, if the queen dies or is removed, reproduction in workers increases because a significant proportion of workers then have activated ovaries.

In that case, workers are related by three-quarters of their genes, and the sons of workers are [[Coefficient of relationship|related]] more than usual to sons of the queen. Then the benefit of policing is negated. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social [[hymenoptera]].<ref>Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A.

From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight and stopping flight for additional shivering, passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and [[evaporative cooling]] from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernd Heinrich |year=1996 |title=How the honey bee regulates its body temperature |journal=[[Bee World]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=130\u2013137 |url=http://www.ibra.org.uk/articles/20100224_2|doi=10.1080/0005772X.1996.11099304 }}</ref>\n\nThe optimal air temperature for [[Forage (honey bee)|foraging]] is {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}}.

[[Karl von Frisch]], who received the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his study of honey bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive.<ref name=\"Capinera2008\">{{cite book|author=John L.

Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within {{convert|50|m}} of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their [[Olfaction|olfactory sense]] to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Unlike western honey bees, the [[Apis florea|dwarf honey bee]] does not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beekman|first=Madeleine|displayauthors=etal|title=Dance Precision of Apis florea\u2014Clues to the Evolution of the Honeybee Dance Language?|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=8|year=2008|pages=1259\u20131265|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0554-z}}</ref> Therefore, western honey bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that the former are more evolved than the latter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biewer|first1=Matthias|last2=Schlesinger|first2=Francisca|last3=Hasselmann|first3=Martin|title=The evolutionary dynamics of major regulators for sexual development among Hymenoptera species|journal=Frontiers in Genetics|date=10 April 2015|volume=6|pages=124|doi=10.3389/fgene.2015.00124|pmc=4392698|pmid=25914717}}</ref>\n\nAnother means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsoventrally]] while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92% of observed shaking signals and 64% of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71% of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.\n\n====Pheromones====\n{{Main|Honey bee pheromones}}\nPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey bee survival.

They argue that western honey bees are able to survive without human help, and in fact require to \"be left at liberty\" to survive. Further, they argue that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants.

Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a [[superorganism]]).\n\nWestern honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to [[honey]], which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of [[digestive enzyme]]s and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Western honey bees also collect [[pollen]] which, after being processed to [[Bee pollen|bee bread]], supplies protein and fat for the [[Brood (honey bee)|bee brood]] to grow. Centuries of [[selective breeding]] by humans have created western honey bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.\n\n[[File:Western Honey Bees and Honeycomb Closeup.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Many honey bees on a comb|Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper]]\n\nBeekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]]: [[skep]]s, [[Langstroth hive]]s, [[top-bar hive]]s, [[box hive]]s, [[log gum]]s, D. E. hives, and miller hives.<ref name=caron/> All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).\n\nIn cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of [[Diseases of the honey bee#Nosema|dysentery]] and causes an excessive buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] from the bees' [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon dioxide dispersal.\n\n====Products====\n\n[[File:Western honey bee (Apis mellifera).webm|thumb|Western honey bee in a park in Tokyo]] \n[[File:Pumpkin pollination4365.jpg|thumb|alt=Beehives in a planted field|Beehives set up for pollination]]\n[[File:Bee on crocus.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Bee collecting pollen from a blue crocus|Video of western honey bee collecting pollen from blue crocuses]]\n[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|alt=Bee in flight, carrying pollen in a yellow container large for its size|Western honey bee carrying pollen in a [[Pollen basket|basket]] back to the hive]]\n\n====Honey bees====\nHoney bees are one of the products of a beehive. They can be purchased as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen along with two to five pounds (0.91 to 2.27&nbsp;kg) of honey bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood), or as full colonies. Commerce of western honey bees dates back to as early as 1622, when the first colonies of bees were shipped from England to Virginia. Modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date back to the late 1800s. Honey was extracted by killing off the hive, and bees and bee products were mainly an object of local trade. The first commercial beekeeper in the United States is considered Moses Quinby of New York, who experimented with movable box hives, which allow extraction without killing the hive. The improvements in roads and motor vehicles after World War I allowed commercial beekeepers to expand the size of their businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beesource.com/resources/usda/history-of-beekeeping-in-the-united-states/|title=History of Beekeeping in the United States {{!}} Beesource Beekeeping|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Pollination====\n[[File:M\u00e9h (2).jpg|thumb|Western honey bee pollinating a flower]]\n{{Main|Pollination management|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\n\nThe western honey bee is an important [[pollinator]] of crops; this service accounts for much of the species' commercial value.

In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to overwinter sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes.\n\nIn [[California]], [[almond]] pollination occurs in February, early in the [[growing season]] before local hives have built up their populations. Almond [[orchard]]s require two hives per acre, or {{Convert|2000|m2||abbr=on|adj=}} per hive, for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. [[Almond#Pollination|Almond pollination]] (in February and March in the U.S.) is the largest [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country.

It is popularly called as soduku in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. It had been popular in [[Sistan]] region of [[Iran]] through trade. The game was said to have been popular among the [[Yadava]] people; an [[abhang]] by [[Tukaram]] stated that the god [[Krishna]] played the game in his youth, while the [[Mahabharata]] contains an account of [[Arjuna]] being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathed, which they are claiming that parallels the gameplay of kabaddi.\n\nThere are accounts of [[Gautama Buddha]] having played the game recreationally.{{Citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nDespite these conflicting claims, India has been credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the [[National Games of India|Indian Olympic Games]] in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1951 Asian Games|inaugural 1951 Asian Games]] in [[New Delhi]].

Each has five supplementary players held in reserve (in other words, for substitution). The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a \"raid\", a player from the attacking side, known as the \"raider\", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.prokabaddi.com/prokabaddi-rules | title= Pro Kabaddi Rules | website= prokabaddi.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref> While raiding, the raider must loudly chant ''kabaddi'', confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. A 30-second limit is also enforced on each raid.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nA point is scored for each defender tagged. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is \"revived\" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players. Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an \"empty raid\". By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a \"super raid\". If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (\"All Out\"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nAdditional rules are used in the [[Pro Kabaddi League]]: if a team has two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point, because the next raid is a \"do-or-die\" raid. In this raid, the player must either get a point or be out. If the raider does not get a point then the opposite team will get a point and the raider will be declared out. Additionally when fewer than four players left on the field, tackles are worth 2 points (\"super tackle\").<ref name= \"kabaddiikf\">{{cite web|url=http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|title=Rules of Kabaddi|publisher=International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)|access-date=26 August 2014|url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html|title=Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works|date=2016-10-05|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017|title=Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\">{{Cite news |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/|title=Everything you need to know about Kabaddi|date=2016-01-30|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Circle style===\n[[File:Kabaddi Match (Bhimber).jpg|thumb|right|A circle kabaddi match being played in [[Bhimber]]]]\nThere are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation.

There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.

It had been popular in [[Sistan]] region of [[Iran]] through trade. The game was said to have been popular among the [[Yadava]] people; an [[abhang]] by [[Tukaram]] stated that the god [[Krishna]] played the game in his youth, while the [[Mahabharata]] contains an account of [[Arjuna]] being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathed, which they are claiming that parallels the gameplay of kabaddi.\n\nThere are accounts of [[Gautama Buddha]] having played the game recreationally.{{Citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nDespite these conflicting claims, India has been credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the [[National Games of India|Indian Olympic Games]] in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1951 Asian Games|inaugural 1951 Asian Games]] in [[New Delhi]].

Each has five supplementary players held in reserve (in other words, for substitution). The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a \"raid\", a player from the attacking side, known as the \"raider\", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.prokabaddi.com/prokabaddi-rules | title= Pro Kabaddi Rules | website= prokabaddi.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref> While raiding, the raider must loudly chant ''kabaddi'', confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. A 30-second limit is also enforced on each raid.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nA point is scored for each defender tagged. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is \"revived\" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players. Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an \"empty raid\". By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a \"super raid\". If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (\"All Out\"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nAdditional rules are used in the [[Pro Kabaddi League]]: if a team has two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point, because the next raid is a \"do-or-die\" raid. In this raid, the player must either get a point or be out. If the raider does not get a point then the opposite team will get a point and the raider will be declared out. Additionally when fewer than four players left on the field, tackles are worth 2 points (\"super tackle\").<ref name= \"kabaddiikf\">{{cite web|url=http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|title=Rules of Kabaddi|publisher=International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)|access-date=26 August 2014|url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html|title=Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works|date=2016-10-05|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017|title=Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\">{{Cite news |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/|title=Everything you need to know about Kabaddi|date=2016-01-30|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Circle style===\n[[File:Kabaddi Match (Bhimber).jpg|thumb|right|A circle kabaddi match being played in [[Bhimber]]]]\nThere are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation. In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13.

Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.
