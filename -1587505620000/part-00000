The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received divided or mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are about 2 million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting. So many new species are discover up to this time also. So it is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region.\n\nThe following list provide mites currently identified in Sri Lanka.\n\n==Mites==\n*Phylum: [[Arthropoda]]\n*Class: [[Arachnida]]\n*Subclass: [[Acari]]\n*Superorder: [[Parasitiformes]]\n*Superorder: [[Acariformes]]\n\n'''Mites''', along with [[tick]]s, are small [[arthropod]]s belonging to the subclass [[Acari]] (also known as Acarina) and the class [[Arachnid]]a. The scientific discipline devoted to the study of ticks and mites is called [[acarology]]. In soil ecosystems, mites are favored by high organic matter content and by moist conditions, wherein they actively engage in the fragmentation and mixing of organic matter.<ref name=\"brady\">{{cite book|author1=Nyle C.

They have exploited an incredible array of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s, and because of their small size (most are [[Microorganism|microscopic]]), go largely unnoticed. Many live freely in the soil or water, but there are also a large number of species that live as [[parasite]]s on plants, animals, and some that feed on [[mold]]. It is estimated that 48,200 species of mites have been described. Mites diversity of Sri Lanka is not fully studied largely as did to ticks.

|url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/108/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

{"title_page": "Conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects", "text_new": "The '''conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects''' is the preservation of objects made from or containing these organic materials by preventive methods and treatments. Because these materials are both versatile and durable, they have been used throughout history for various tools and/or ornamentation including clothing, jewelry, and decorative art. These objects can be found in personal collections as well as cultural institutions and their collections.\n\n==Identification and composition==\n\nMany museums contain objects in their collection that are made of bone, antler or horn. One of the most important steps in the conservation of these objects is determining which material it is.\n\n===Bone===\nBone, which has a very similar chemical make-up to [[ivory]], consists of inorganic materials which provide strength and rigidity and organic components that provide the capacity for growth and repair. Unlike ivory which has no marrow or blood vessel system, bone has a spongy central portion of marrow from which extend tiny blood vessels.<ref name=\"CCI\">{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> Bone is also made of both mineral and carbon-based materials; the mineral-based are [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], and [[fluoride]]; the carbon-based is the [[protein]] ossein.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>  \n\nBone comes from many different animals, including mammals, birds, and fish, and can come in many shapes and sizes. It can be used in its natural form, can be polished with sand and other abrasives to create a smooth and glossy surface, or can be treated with a burning process which leaves it a blue-black to whitish gray color.<ref name=\"MHS\" /> \n\nBones have been used to create numerous objects throughout history, from tools such as hammers and fishhooks to weapons such spear, arrow, and harpoon points to pendants, hairpins, gaming pieces, musical instruments and ceremonial objects.<ref name=\"CMNH\">{{cite web|title=Anthropology: Bone, Antler, and Tooth Artifacts|url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/science/default.aspx?id=16600|website=Carnegie Museum of Natural History|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Antler===\nAntler, a modified form of bone, grows out of the skull bones of certain species of animals and is shed once a year.<ref name=\"MHS\" /> It consists of a thick layer of compact bone, an inner section of spongy bone, and internal blood vessels that are less and more irregular than the ones present in bone. It is also denser and heavier.<ref name=\"CCI\">{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> Antler also differs from bone in its external appearance. Skeletal bone is usually smooth except for areas of attachment, while the surface of larger antlers generally has raised bumps and protrusions. \n\nSimilar to bone, antler can be used in its natural form, can be polished with abrasives for a glossy surface, and can be treated with a burned process for a charred finish and color.<ref name=\"MHS\" /> Antler has been used for numerous objects throughout history including tools such as hammer batons, pressure flakers, and conical arrow points.<ref name=\"OSA\">{{cite web|title=Bone Tools|url=http://archaeology.uiowa.edu/bone-tools-0|website=The Office of the State Archaeologist|publisher=The University of Iowa|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Horn===\nHorn is the outer covering of a bony outgrowth on an animal's skull. It consists of a mass of very hard, hair-like filaments cemented together around a spongy internal core.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> This layering effect continues to grow over time, resulting in a cone-within-cone structure. Unlike antlers, horns are permanent and not seasonally shed. Another distinguishing factor from bone and antler is the fine parallel lines that are present in the surface of the horn. Horn comes in a great variety of sizes and colors, including white,  green, red, brown, and black.<ref name=\"AIC\">{{cite web|title=Horn|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Horn|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> \n\nHorn can be used in its natural state, boiled, cut, molded to other shapes, or used in flat sheets.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> It has been used for a variety of objects including ceremonial decorations, utensils such as spoons and containers, gaming pieces, and combs.<ref name=\"AIC\" />\n\n==Processing==\n\nIn general, the same preparation process can be applied to bone, horn, and antler for conversion into usable materials for tools or ornamentation.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n* Detaching, or separating the bone, antler, or horn from the muscles and connective tissue of the animal, is the first step.\n* Cleaning, the second step, involves removing the blood, marrow and cells from the interior.\n* Drying in a slow process to avoid cracking and splitting is the third.\n* Working the bone, antler, or horn into the desired shape and finish is the final step. These methods include cutting with stone or metal tools, polishing with abrasives, burning, and/or decorating with pigments such as [[ochre]] or [[charcoal]].\n\n==Types of deterioration==\nThere are numerous causes for the deterioration of bone, antler, and horn.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nThese causes include:\n* Extreme dryness\n* Excess heat, which leads to the destruction of the protein portion and loss of moisture, resulting in shrinkage and surface cracking\n* Excess moisture, which leads to the swelling of the protein portion and promotes mold growth\n* A combination of both excess heat and moisture can lead to the destruction of ossein, resulting in warping and cracking as the materials dry out.\n* Pests such as rodents, which may chew and attack these materials, especially bone\n* Acids\n* Exposure to strong visible and ultraviolet light, which may bleach the natural color of these materials\n\n==Preventive conservation==\n\n===Handling===\nLike any museum objects, the handling of bone, antler, and horn should be conducted in a manner conducive to maintaining the health of the object. These items can be handled with bare hands that are clean and dry. However, body oils can stain the surface of these materials, especially because of their matte, porous surface texture, or those that are light in color. Wearing cotton or latex gloves is one way to prevent the transition of these harmful oils.\n\nItems that contain bone, antler, or horn should always be lifted and moved in a manner that is fully supportive and does not place unnecessary stress on weak areas or attachment points; using an acid-free tray is highly recommended.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> These objects can  be protected further by being wrapped in unbuffered, acid-free tissue paper and/or placed in a sealed [[polyethylene]] bag when being transported.<ref name=\"CCI\">{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Basic cleaning===\nWhen objects are in good condition, normal surface dirt and grime is removed safely in a few different ways. One way is by using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> To remove surface dust, a variable speed vacuum, soft lint-free cloths, vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and micro-attachments may be used.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nIf dusting alone is not enough, smooth materials are then cleaned with water and mild soap. A cotton swab is used to apply a soapy solution sparingly. The surface can not remain damp longer than a few seconds and will immediately be dried with a soft tissue or another cotton swab. The same area will be cleaned again in the same manner to remove any soap film. If the surface is cracked or porous, water will not be applied. Bone should never be soaked.<ref name=\"CCI\" />\n\n===Storage===\nBone, antler, and horn objects are stored in tightly closed display cases or drawers to buffer them from sudden changes in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] while shielding them from dust and dirt. By storing them in the dark, these light-sensitive materials that are dyed or painted are protected. To prevent bumping and chipping, the storage drawers and shelves are lined with a chemically stable cushioning material such as [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]] sheeting, as opposed to a rubber-based material that can produce unnatural yellowing.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> Items with holes, straps, appendages, etc. are never hung or supported by said attachments. Instead, they are stored with a support at the base of the item, and a support for the natural position of the handle or strap.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nProper storage also aids in the regulation of temperature, relative humidity, and safe illumination levels, which can have disastrous effects on these organic materials if they fluctuate. Bone, antler, and horn objects are never stored near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, or incandescent lights, because these can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations.<ref name=\"MHS\" /> \n* Temperature is kept as constant as possible, no greater than 68 degrees Fahrenheit with no fluctuations of more than +/- 3 degrees a day.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n* Relative humidity is kept at a level between 30 percent (in the winter) and 55 percent (in the summer) with fluctuations of no more than 15 percent during each season.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n* Illumination is kept below 150 lux, with the ultraviolet (UV) component restricted to 75. Dyed objects are extremely light-sensitive and being exposed to lux levels more than 50 is damaging. Maintaining low light levels and using lights that emit less radiant heat is an effective way to prevent damage. Shining direct bright light on tightly sealed storage units can reproduce high temperatures and high RH internally, putting the stored objects at risk.<ref name=\"CCI\" />\n\n===Integrated pest management===\nAlthough bone, antler, and horn are not particularly susceptible to insect damage, they can be damaged by rodent attacks and mold growth. Rodents and other small mammals can gnaw on the surface of these items, causing structural damage. Maintaining good housekeeping, following an IPM program, and holding regular pest control checks will help prevent a rodent infestation.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n[[Mold (fungus)|Mold]] can infest these organic objects when the relative humidity in storage and display areas exceeds 60 percent for extended periods of time. White or greenish fuzzy growth on the surface of these objects is an indicator of a mold infestation. Good ventilation and air circulation prevents mold as well as properly regulating relative humidity levels.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n==Display issues==\n\nPreventive care can protect bone, antler, and horn objects from damaging elements, but objects on display are put at risk and therefore need to be carefully monitored. Maintaining proper temperature and relative humidity is important to protect the health of objects on display. Rotating bone, antler, and horn items on display on a set timeline prevents them from being exposed for extended periods of time. \n* Light damage: extended exposure to harmful light results in surface color being bleached and excessive drying. Consulting a [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] or exhibition light specialist for proper exhibition lighting can help prevent this.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* External supports: supports and mounts are fabricated from safe materials. Attaching items to mounts is done with padded wires or flat acyclic plastic clips. Metals in direct contact with these organic objects cause damage; fats that may remain in these organic items react with the metals, forming corrosion. The use of adhesive mounts is avoided.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Interventive conservation==\nWhen issues arise in objects made of bone, antler, or horn that need extensive treatment, a conservator should be consulted. Some treatments include the following.\n\n===Intensive cleaning===\n* Removal of surface dirt: when minimal dusting and maintenance are not successful in removing surface dust, a conservator may perform more intensive cleaning, using water and a safe cleaner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Donny|title=Methods of Conserving Archaeological Material from Underwater Sites|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/CRL/conservationmanual/ConservationManual.pdf|publisher=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Removal of soluble salts: organic materials from a salty environment will invariably absorb soluble salts that will crystallize as the object dries. Salt crystallization will cause surface flaking and may result in irreversible damage. [[Conservators]] will remove the soluble salt to make the object stable by using water with certain levels of chloride and ionization, only if the object is structurally sound.\n* Removal of insoluble salts and stains: to remove insoluble salts and stains, conservators either use a mechanical method with picks and other tools, or a chemical treatment.\n\n===Harmful conservation treatments===\nWhen addressing minor repairs and minimal cleaning of objects containing bone, antler, or horn, there are some methods/products that are avoided.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Liquid-base cleaners or detergents used to clean surface dirt and dust can damage the objects.\n* Over-the-counter adhesives used to repair cracks and breaks can stain and become brittle over time. It is important to note that cracks and breaks in these organic materials can be indicators and evidence of an object's use and history, and therefore should not be addressed unless the health of the object is in danger. \n* Wax or other protective coating used to make repairs can obscure surface details, cause discoloring of the surface and are often impossible to remove without causing further damage.\n\nAlways consult a conservator before progressing with a treatment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- (Commenting this out because we generally don't keep big lists of external links.

Horn comes in a great variety of sizes and colors, including white,  green, red, brown, and black.<ref name=\"AIC\">{{cite web|title=Horn|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Horn|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> \n\nHorn can be used in its natural state, boiled, cut, molded to other shapes, or used in flat sheets.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> It has been used for a variety of objects including ceremonial decorations, utensils such as spoons and containers, gaming pieces, and combs.<ref name=\"AIC\" />\n\n==Processing==\n\nIn general, the same preparation process can be applied to bone, horn, and antler for conversion into usable materials for tools or ornamentation.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n* Detaching, or separating the bone, antler, or horn from the muscles and connective tissue of the animal, is the first step.\n* Cleaning, the second step, involves removing the blood, marrow and cells from the interior.\n* Drying in a slow process to avoid cracking and splitting is the third.\n* Working the bone, antler, or horn into the desired shape and finish is the final step. These methods include cutting with stone or metal tools, polishing with abrasives, burning, and/or decorating with pigments such as [[ochre]] or [[charcoal]].\n\n==Types of deterioration==\nThere are numerous causes for the deterioration of bone, antler, and horn.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nThese causes include:\n* Extreme dryness\n* Excess heat, which leads to the destruction of the protein portion and loss of moisture, resulting in shrinkage and surface cracking\n* Excess moisture, which leads to the swelling of the protein portion and promotes mold growth\n* A combination of both excess heat and moisture can lead to the destruction of ossein, resulting in warping and cracking as the materials dry out.\n* Pests such as rodents, which may chew and attack these materials, especially bone\n* Acids\n* Exposure to strong visible and ultraviolet light, which may bleach the natural color of these materials\n\n==Preventive conservation==\n\n===Handling===\nLike any museum objects, the handling of bone, antler, and horn should be conducted in a manner conducive to maintaining the health of the object. These items can be handled with bare hands that are clean and dry. However, body oils can stain the surface of these materials, especially because of their matte, porous surface texture, or those that are light in color. Wearing cotton or latex gloves is one way to prevent the transition of these harmful oils.\n\nItems that contain bone, antler, or horn should always be lifted and moved in a manner that is fully supportive and does not place unnecessary stress on weak areas or attachment points; using an acid-free tray is highly recommended.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> These objects can  be protected further by being wrapped in unbuffered, acid-free tissue paper and/or placed in a sealed [[polyethylene]] bag when being transported.<ref name=\"CCI\">{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Basic cleaning===\nWhen objects are in good condition, normal surface dirt and grime is removed safely in a few different ways. One way is by using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> To remove surface dust, a variable speed vacuum, soft lint-free cloths, vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and micro-attachments may be used.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nIf dusting alone is not enough, smooth materials are then cleaned with water and mild soap. A cotton swab is used to apply a soapy solution sparingly. The surface can not remain damp longer than a few seconds and will immediately be dried with a soft tissue or another cotton swab. The same area will be cleaned again in the same manner to remove any soap film. If the surface is cracked or porous, water will not be applied. Bone should never be soaked.<ref name=\"CCI\" />\n\n===Storage===\nBone, antler, and horn objects are stored in tightly closed display cases or drawers to buffer them from sudden changes in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] while shielding them from dust and dirt. By storing them in the dark, these light-sensitive materials that are dyed or painted are protected. To prevent bumping and chipping, the storage drawers and shelves are lined with a chemically stable cushioning material such as [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]] sheeting, as opposed to a rubber-based material that can produce unnatural yellowing.<ref name=\"CCI\" /> Items with holes, straps, appendages, etc. are never hung or supported by said attachments. Instead, they are stored with a support at the base of the item, and a support for the natural position of the handle or strap.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\nProper storage also aids in the regulation of temperature, relative humidity, and safe illumination levels, which can have disastrous effects on these organic materials if they fluctuate. Bone, antler, and horn objects are never stored near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, or incandescent lights, because these can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations.<ref name=\"MHS\" /> \n* Temperature is kept as constant as possible, no greater than 68 degrees Fahrenheit with no fluctuations of more than +/- 3 degrees a day.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n* Relative humidity is kept at a level between 30 percent (in the winter) and 55 percent (in the summer) with fluctuations of no more than 15 percent during each season.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n* Illumination is kept below 150 lux, with the ultraviolet (UV) component restricted to 75. Dyed objects are extremely light-sensitive and being exposed to lux levels more than 50 is damaging. Maintaining low light levels and using lights that emit less radiant heat is an effective way to prevent damage. Shining direct bright light on tightly sealed storage units can reproduce high temperatures and high RH internally, putting the stored objects at risk.<ref name=\"CCI\" />\n\n===Integrated pest management===\nAlthough bone, antler, and horn are not particularly susceptible to insect damage, they can be damaged by rodent attacks and mold growth. Rodents and other small mammals can gnaw on the surface of these items, causing structural damage. Maintaining good housekeeping, following an IPM program, and holding regular pest control checks will help prevent a rodent infestation.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n[[Mold]] can infest these organic objects when the relative humidity in storage and display areas exceeds 60 percent for extended periods of time. White or greenish fuzzy growth on the surface of these objects is an indicator of a mold infestation. Good ventilation and air circulation prevents mold as well as properly regulating relative humidity levels.<ref name=\"MHS\" />\n\n==Display issues==\n\nPreventive care can protect bone, antler, and horn objects from damaging elements, but objects on display are put at risk and therefore need to be carefully monitored. Maintaining proper temperature and relative humidity is important to protect the health of objects on display. Rotating bone, antler, and horn items on display on a set timeline prevents them from being exposed for extended periods of time. \n* Light damage: extended exposure to harmful light results in surface color being bleached and excessive drying. Consulting a [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] or exhibition light specialist for proper exhibition lighting can help prevent this.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* External supports: supports and mounts are fabricated from safe materials. Attaching items to mounts is done with padded wires or flat acyclic plastic clips. Metals in direct contact with these organic objects cause damage; fats that may remain in these organic items react with the metals, forming corrosion. The use of adhesive mounts is avoided.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Interventive conservation==\nWhen issues arise in objects made of bone, antler, or horn that need extensive treatment, a conservator should be consulted. Some treatments include the following.\n\n===Intensive cleaning===\n* Removal of surface dirt: when minimal dusting and maintenance are not successful in removing surface dust, a conservator may perform more intensive cleaning, using water and a safe cleaner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Donny|title=Methods of Conserving Archaeological Material from Underwater Sites|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/CRL/conservationmanual/ConservationManual.pdf|publisher=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Removal of soluble salts: organic materials from a salty environment will invariably absorb soluble salts that will crystallize as the object dries. Salt crystallization will cause surface flaking and may result in irreversible damage. [[Conservators]] will remove the soluble salt to make the object stable by using water with certain levels of chloride and ionization, only if the object is structurally sound.\n* Removal of insoluble salts and stains: to remove insoluble salts and stains, conservators either use a mechanical method with picks and other tools, or a chemical treatment.\n\n===Harmful conservation treatments===\nWhen addressing minor repairs and minimal cleaning of objects containing bone, antler, or horn, there are some methods/products that are avoided.<ref name=\"MHS\">{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Liquid-base cleaners or detergents used to clean surface dirt and dust can damage the objects.\n* Over-the-counter adhesives used to repair cracks and breaks can stain and become brittle over time. It is important to note that cracks and breaks in these organic materials can be indicators and evidence of an object's use and history, and therefore should not be addressed unless the health of the object is in danger. \n* Wax or other protective coating used to make repairs can obscure surface details, cause discoloring of the surface and are often impossible to remove without causing further damage.\n\nAlways consult a conservator before progressing with a treatment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- (Commenting this out because we generally don't keep big lists of external links.

Dorado is subdivided into five [[barrio]]s and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town is regarded as a tourist destination with golf courses, hotels, and beaches{{By whom|section=Discussion about whom|date=November 2019}}. It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nThe [[Dorado Airport]] was operated from 1942 to 1996. The airport began as a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with [[Caribair]] and [[Dorado Wings]] flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s and then fell into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.\n\nDorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a ''plaza'' (Spanish [[town square]]), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town's patron saint is [[Saint Anthony of Padua|Anthony of Padua]], and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a ''\"Sitio de Dorado\"'' (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prfrogui.com/home/dorado.htm|title=Dorado - Municipio de Puerto Rico|publisher=Portal PRFrogui|date=|accessdate=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303083710/http://www.prfrogui.com/home/dorado.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or [[ward (politics)|ward]]) of the town of [[Toa Baja]]. Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the \"new pueblo\" to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the \"old pueblo.\"  Over several years, the wards that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the \"new pueblo\" wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja.\n\nOn November 22, 1842, Jacinto L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], Santiago M\u00e9ndez Vigo, to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez became the first mayor of Dorado.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Dorado was 3,804.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

Dorado is spread over five [[barrio]]s and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town is regarded as a tourist destination with golf courses, hotels, and beaches{{By whom|section=Discussion about whom|date=November 2019}}. It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nThe [[Dorado Airport]] was operated from 1942 to 1996. The airport began as a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with [[Caribair]] and [[Dorado Wings]] flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s and then fell into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.\n\nDorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a ''plaza'' (Spanish [[town square]]), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town's patron saint is [[Saint Anthony of Padua|Anthony of Padua]], and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a ''\"Sitio de Dorado\"'' (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prfrogui.com/home/dorado.htm|title=Dorado - Municipio de Puerto Rico|publisher=Portal PRFrogui|date=|accessdate=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303083710/http://www.prfrogui.com/home/dorado.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or [[ward (politics)|ward]]) of the town of [[Toa Baja]]. Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the \"new pueblo\" to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the \"old pueblo.\"  Over several years, the wards that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the \"new pueblo\" wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja.\n\nOn November 22, 1842, Jacinto L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], Santiago M\u00e9ndez Vigo, to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez became the first mayor of Dorado.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Dorado was 3,804.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.
