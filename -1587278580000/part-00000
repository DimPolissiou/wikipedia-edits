Nero's mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]], dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign.<ref name=\"Jarus\" />\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, Nero was content to be guided by his mother, his tutor [[Seneca the younger|Lucius Annaeus Seneca]], and his [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. As time passed, he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. During his reign, the redoubtable general [[Corbulo]] conducted a [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363|successful war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthian Empire]]. His general [[Suetonius Paulinus]] crushed a major revolt in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led by the [[Iceni]] Queen [[Boudica]]. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was briefly annexed to the empire, and the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] began. Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician and charioteer. In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. In contrast, his populist style of rule remained very popular among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. Various plots against his life were revealed; the ringleaders, most of them Nero's own courtiers, were executed (at least until his final demise).\n\nIn AD 68 [[Vindex]], governor of the [[Gaul]]ish territory [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], rebelled. He was supported by [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. Vindex's revolt failed in its immediate aim, but Nero fled Rome when Rome's discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor.

Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.\n\nWhile Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy (\"hostis publicus\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Garzetti, Albino |title=From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14\u2013192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT220|date=2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69843-2|pages=220\u2013}}</ref>). The prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Nymphidius Sabinus|Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus]], also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.\n\nIn response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': \"Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?\" Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences \"and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the [[Egypt (Roman province)|prefecture of Egypt]]\". Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#47 47].</ref>\n\nNero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a [[gladiator]] or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, \"Have I neither friend nor foe?\" and ran out as if to throw himself into the [[Tiber]].<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nReturning, Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], offered his villa, located {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal [[freedman|freedmen]], [[Epaphroditos]], [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], [[Neophytus (freedman)|Neophytus]], and [[Sporus]], reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.\n\nAt this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy, that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death, and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the [[Roman Forum]]. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action, as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#72|XV.72]].</ref>\n\nNero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for [[forced suicide|suicide]], pacing up and down muttering ''Qualis artifex pereo'' (\"What an artist dies in me\").<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Buckley | first1 = Emma | last2 = Dinter | first2 = Martin T. | title = A Companion to the Neronian Age | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2013 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | isbn = 978-1-118-31659-7 | access-date = 27 December 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507051146/https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | archive-date = 7 May 2016 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Losing his nerve, he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first.

Around 57{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} and 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} [[Domitius Corbulo]] and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital [[Artaxata]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]] was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked [[Adiabene]], Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia.\n\nThe Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts; when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia, it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulo's earlier victory was part-built when Parthian envoys arrived in 63 AD to discuss treaties.    \nGiven ''imperium'' over the eastern regions, Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians: Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia, only if he agreed to receive his [[diadem]] from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy 66{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}}. Dio reports that Tiridates said \"I have come to you, my God, worshiping you as [[Mithras]].\" Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including \"The New [[Apollo]]\" and \"The New Sun.\" After the coronation, friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia.

He both sang and played the ''[[cithara]]'' (a type of [[lyre]]). Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite, but Nero's devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class.<ref name=\"griffin\"/>{{rp|41\u201342}} Ancient sources were critical of Nero's emphasis on the arts, chariot-racing and athletics. Pliny described Nero as an \"actor-emperor\" (''scaenici imperatoris'') and Suetonius wrote that he was \"carried away by a craze for popularity...since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot, he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well.\"<ref name=champlin/>{{rp|53}}\n\nIn 67 {{sc|AD}} Nero participated in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympics]].

Nero won every contest in which he was a competitor.  During the games Nero sang and played his lyre on stage, acted in tragedies and raced chariots. He won a 10-horse chariot race, despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race. He was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race.

These first histories, while they still existed, were described as biased and fantastical, either overly critical or praising of Nero.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.3]]; Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#10|10]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]].</ref> The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#2|XIV.2]].</ref> Nonetheless, these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.13]].</ref> A few of the contemporary historians are known by name.

Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero's death. These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of [[Claudius]], the death of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.\n\nA handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n;Cassius Dio\n[[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155\u2013229) was the son of [[Cassius Apronianus]], a Roman senator.

Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:\n\n{{quote|The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was the son of a [[Promagistrate|procurator]], who married into the elite family of Agricola.

Nero became terrified, believing that God wanted the [[Second Temple]] to be destroyed, but that he would punish the one to carry it out.

Nero's mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]], dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign.<ref name=\"Jarus\" />\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, Nero was content to be guided by his mother, his tutor [[Seneca the younger|Lucius Annaeus Seneca]], and his [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. As time passed, he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. During his reign, the redoubtable general [[Corbulo]] conducted a [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363|successful war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthian Empire]]. His general [[Suetonius Paulinus]] crushed a major revolt in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led by the [[Iceni]] Queen [[Boudica]]. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was briefly annexed to the empire, and the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] began. Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician and charioteer. In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. In contrast, his populist style of rule remained very popular among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. Various plots against his life were revealed; the ringleaders, most of them Nero's own courtiers, were executed (at least until his final demise).\n\nIn AD 68 [[Vindex]], governor of the [[Gaul]]ish territory [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], rebelled. He was supported by [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. Vindex's revolt failed in its immediate aim, but Nero fled Rome when Rome's discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor. He committed suicide on June 9 in AD 68, when he learned that he had been [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] and condemned to death as a public enemy, making him the first Roman Emperor to commit suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49|title=Suetonius \u2022 Life of Nero|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Barnes, T.D. |title=The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories|volume=72|issue=3|jstor=268314|journal=Classical Philology|year=1977|pages= 224\u201331 [228]|doi=10.1086/366355}}</ref> His death ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].\n\nNero's rule is usually associated with [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and extravagance.<ref>[[Galba]] criticized the excesses (''luxuria'') of Nero's public and private spending.

Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.\n\nWhile Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy (\"hostis publicus\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Garzetti, Albino |title=From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14\u2013192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT220|date=2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69843-2|pages=220\u2013}}</ref>). The prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Nymphidius Sabinus|Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus]], also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.\n\nIn response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': \"Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?\" Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences \"and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the [[Egypt (Roman province)|prefecture of Egypt]]\". Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#47 47].</ref>\n\nNero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a [[gladiator]] or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, \"Have I neither friend nor foe?\" and ran out as if to throw himself into the [[Tiber]].<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nReturning, Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], offered his villa, located {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal [[freedman|freedmen]], [[Epaphroditos]], [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], [[Neophytus (freedman)|Neophytus]], and [[Sporus]], reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.\n\nAt this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy, that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death, and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the [[Roman Forum]]. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action, as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#72|XV.72]].</ref>\n\nNero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for [[forced suicide|suicide]], pacing up and down muttering ''Qualis artifex pereo'' (\"What an artist dies in me\").<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Buckley | first1 = Emma | last2 = Dinter | first2 = Martin T. | title = A Companion to the Neronian Age | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2013 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | isbn = 978-1-118-31659-7 | access-date = 2015-12-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507051146/https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | archive-date = 2016-05-07 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Losing his nerve, he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first.

Around 57{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} and 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} [[Domitius Corbulo]] and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital [[Artaxata]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]] was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked [[Adiabene]], Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia.\n\nThe Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts; when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia, it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulo's earlier victory was part-built when Parthian envoys arrived in 63 AD to discuss treaties.    \nGiven ''imperium'' over the eastern regions, Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians: Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia, only if he agreed to receive his [[diadem]] from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy 66{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}}. Dio reports that Tiridates said \"I have come to you, my God, worshiping you as [[Mithras]].\" Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including \"The New [[Apollo]]\" and \"The New Sun.\" After the coronation, friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia.

He both sang and played the ''[[cithara]]'' (a type of [[lyre]]). Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite, but Nero's devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class.<ref name=\"griffin\"/>{{rp|41\u201342}} Ancient sources were critical of Nero's emphasis on the arts, chariot-racing and athletics.

These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of [[Claudius]], the death of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.\n\nA handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n;Cassius Dio\n[[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155\u2013229) was the son of [[Cassius Apronianus]], a Roman senator.

Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:\n\n{{quote|The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was the son of a [[Promagistrate|procurator]], who married into the elite family of Agricola.

The child responded, \"I will lay my vengeance upon [[Edom]] by the hand of my people Israel\" ([[Ezekiel 25]] [http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Eze-25.html 25,14]).
