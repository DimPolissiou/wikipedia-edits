He won the [[2009 Formula One World Championship]], driving for [[Brawn GP]]. After his Formula One career, he became a champion of the [[Super GT|Super GT Series]] in [[2018 Super GT Series|2018]], driving for [[Honda in motorsport|Honda]] [[Team Kunimitsu]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Motegi Super GT: Jenson Button holds off late threat for title|url=https://www.autosport.com/gt/news/139969/button-holds-off-late-threat-for-super-gt-title|website=[[Autosport]].com|publisher=[[Autosport]]|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nButton began karting at the age of eight and achieved early success, before progressing to car racing in the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] and the [[British Formula 3 Championship]]. He first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] for the {{F1|2000}} season. The following year he switched to [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], which in {{F1|2002}} became [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], and then for the {{F1|2003}} season he moved to [[British American Racing|BAR]]. In {{F1|2004}} he finished 3rd in the World Drivers' Championship, with only the two Ferraris ahead of him. BAR was subsequently renamed [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] for the {{F1|2006}} season, during which Button won his first Grand Prix in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], after 113 races.<ref name=\"bbcwin\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5250126.stm|title=Button takes first Grand Prix win|work=BBC Sport|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=18 April 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Honda from the sport in December 2008, he was left without a drive for the {{F1|2009}} season, until [[Ross Brawn]] led a [[management buyout]] of the team in February 2009, and Button suddenly found himself in a highly competitive, [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes]]-engined car. He went on to win a record-tying six of the first seven races of the 2009 season, securing the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] at the {{F1 GP|2009|Brazilian}}, having led on points all season; his success also helped [[Brawn GP]] to secure the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]].\n\nFor {{F1|2010}}, he moved to [[McLaren]], partnering fellow British racer and former World Champion [[Lewis Hamilton]]. After finishing fifth for the team in 2010, Button finished the {{F1|2011}} season as runner-up. In {{F1|2012}} he took his first pole for McLaren at the [[2012 Belgian Grand Prix]]. He spent a fifth season with the McLaren team in 2014, his fifteenth in Formula One, and went on to complete two further years at the team in 2015 and 2016 before stepping back from full-time racing to take an ambassadorial and reserve driver role. He returned for a one-off appearance at the [[2017 Monaco Grand Prix]] in place of Fernando Alonso which elevated him to joint second with [[Michael Schumacher]] in the list of all-time F1 starts. From the 306 races that Button has started he has won 15, with a total of 50 podium finishes despite driving uncompetitive machinery for most of his career. His time in F1 was characterised by fallow early years as he tried to make his mark, a competitive and ultimately successful middle stint in which he won the World Championship and won races for Honda and McLaren and a difficult end to his career as his team struggled with the new regulations introduced in 2014.\n\n==Early life and career==\nButton was born on 19 January 1980 in [[Frome]], Somerset and brought up in nearby [[Mells, Somerset|Vobster]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Eason|first=Kevin|title=Jenson Button v Lewis Hamilton: who is the best of British?|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6880844.ece|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=19 October 2009}}</ref> He is the fourth child of [[South Africa]]n Simone Lyons and former [[Rallycross]] driver [[John Button (racing driver)|John Button]], who was well known in the UK during most of the 1970s for his so-called ''Colorado Beetle'' [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]], before switching to a VW Golf Mk1 in 1978.

Arriving in [[2015 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] Button qualified 17th (out of 18) and finished 11th and last in the detuned McLaren to ensure the team and new power unit supplier, Honda Racing F1 would compile decent mileage because of energy recovery issues. This continued into [[2015 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] where Button had to retire from the race. In [[2015 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], Button collided with Lotus racer [[Pastor Maldonado]] in the latter stages of the Grand Prix. Button received a five-second time penalty dropping him one spot to 14th and two penalty points to his super licence which was previously clean for which the points will last twelve months.

After an energy recovery issue Button could not even start the race. In [[2015 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], he scored his first points of the season, finishing in 8th place. At his home Grand Prix in [[2015 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]], Button retired on the first lap after contact with his teammate Alonso. At the [[2015 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]], Button finished in ninth place. Button also finished ninth at [[2015 Russian Grand Prix|Sochi]] and in the next Grand Prix at [[2015 United States Grand Prix|Austin]] he finished an incredible sixth place out of 12 finishing drivers, with his teammate Alonso finishing eleventh.\n\nBesides the points-scoring positions, Button and his teammate Alonso often qualified in the back of the grid, with the Briton being eliminated very often in Q1 in qualifying. The McLarens were only ahead of the Manors and sometimes also the Saubers. The Honda engine was lacking both reliability and power, with the McLaren car proving slight potential on slow circuits.\n\n====2016====\n[[File:Button Bahrain 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Button at the [[2016 Bahrain Grand Prix]]]]\nAfter the [[2015 Japanese Grand Prix]], McLaren principal [[Ron Dennis]] confirmed that Button would be driving for the team in {{F1|2016}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dennis: Alonso and Button to stay|url=http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12479/10008301/mclaren-boss-ron-dennis-says-fernando-alonso-and-jenson-button-will-race-in-2016|first1=Mike|last1=Wise|first2=William|last2=Esler|work=[[Sky Sports F1]]|publisher=[[BSkyB]]|date=27 September 2015|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34372776|title=Jenson Button staying with McLaren for 2016 \u2013 Ron Dennis|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nThis time the Honda engine showed more pace, but the reliability was still a problem. Sometimes the McLarens were fighting for points, but on many of this races there were problems or retirements, especially for Jenson, who finished the season in fifteenth place with 21 points, with his teammate Alonso in tenth place with 54 points.

driver]] and former Formula One driver. He won the [[2009 Formula One World Championship]], driving for [[Brawn GP]]. After his Formula One career, he became a champion of the [[Super GT|Super GT Series]] in [[2018 Super GT Series|2018]], driving for [[Honda in motorsport|Honda]] [[Team Kunimitsu]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Motegi Super GT: Jenson Button holds off late threat for title|url=https://www.autosport.com/gt/news/139969/button-holds-off-late-threat-for-super-gt-title|website=[[Autosport]].com|publisher=[[Autosport]]|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nButton began karting at the age of eight and achieved early success, before progressing to car racing in the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] and the [[British Formula 3 Championship]]. He first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] for the {{F1|2000}} season. The following year he switched to [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], which in {{F1|2002}} became [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], and then for the {{F1|2003}} season he moved to [[British American Racing|BAR]]. In {{F1|2004}} he finished 3rd in the World Drivers' Championship, with only the two Ferraris ahead of him. BAR was subsequently renamed [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] for the {{F1|2006}} season, during which Button won his first Grand Prix in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], after 113 races.<ref name=\"bbcwin\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5250126.stm|title=Button takes first Grand Prix win|work=BBC Sport|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=18 April 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Honda from the sport in December 2008, he was left without a drive for the {{F1|2009}} season, until [[Ross Brawn]] led a [[management buyout]] of the team in February 2009, and Button suddenly found himself in a highly competitive, [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes]]-engined car. He went on to win a record-tying six of the first seven races of the 2009 season, securing the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] at the {{F1 GP|2009|Brazilian}}, having led on points all season; his success also helped [[Brawn GP]] to secure the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]].\n\nFor {{F1|2010}}, he moved to [[McLaren]], partnering fellow British racer and former World Champion [[Lewis Hamilton]]. After finishing fifth for the team in 2010, Button finished the {{F1|2011}} season as runner-up. In {{F1|2012}} he took his first pole for McLaren at the [[2012 Belgian Grand Prix]]. He spent a fifth season with the McLaren team in 2014, his fifteenth in Formula One, and went on to complete two further years at the team in 2015 and 2016 before stepping back from full-time racing to take an ambassadorial and reserve driver role. He returned for a one-off appearance at the [[2017 Monaco Grand Prix]] in place of Fernando Alonso which elevated him to joint second with [[Michael Schumacher]] in the list of all-time F1 starts. From the 306 races that Button has started he has won 15, with a total of 50 podium finishes despite driving uncompetitive machinery for most of his career. His time in F1 was characterised by fallow early years as he tried to make his mark, a competitive and ultimately successful middle stint in which he won the World Championship and won races for Honda and McLaren and a difficult end to his career as his team struggled with the new regulations introduced in 2014.\n\n==Early life and career==\nButton was born on 19 January 1980 in [[Frome]], Somerset and brought up in nearby [[Mells, Somerset|Vobster]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Eason|first=Kevin|title=Jenson Button v Lewis Hamilton: who is the best of British?|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6880844.ece|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=19 October 2009}}</ref> He is the fourth child of [[South Africa]]n Simone Lyons and former [[Rallycross]] driver [[John Button (racing driver)|John Button]], who was well known in the UK during most of the 1970s for his so-called ''Colorado Beetle'' [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]], before switching to a VW Golf Mk1 in 1978.

Dall'Orto 5 ago 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A detail of the 13th-century [[Fontana Maggiore]] in [[Perugia]] with the fables of [[The Wolf and the Crane]] and [[The Wolf and the Lamb]]]]\n\n'''Aesop's Fables''', or the '''Aesopica''', is a collection of [[fable]]s credited to [[Aesop]], a [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slave]] and storyteller believed to have lived in [[ancient Greece]] between 620 and 564 BCE. Of diverse origins, the stories associated with his name have descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] and in popular as well as artistic media.\n\nThe fables originally belonged to the [[oral tradition]] and were not collected for some three centuries after Aesop's death. By that time a variety of other stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present, with some of the fables unrecorded before the [[Late Middle Ages]] and others arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories are still being added to the Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors.\n\nManuscripts in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were important avenues of transmission, although poetical treatments in European vernaculars eventually formed another.  On the arrival of printing, collections of Aesop's fables were among the earliest books in a variety of languages. Through the means of later collections, and translations or adaptations of them, Aesop's reputation as a fabulist was transmitted throughout the world.\n\nInitially the fables were addressed to adults and covered religious, social and political themes. They were also put to use as ethical guides and from the [[Renaissance]] onwards were particularly used for the education of children. Their ethical dimension was reinforced in the adult world through depiction in sculpture, painting and other illustrative means, as well as adaptation to drama and song. In addition, there have been reinterpretations of the meaning of fables and changes in emphasis over time.\n\n==Fictions that point to the truth==\n[[File:Aesopus - Aesopus moralisatus, circa 1485 - 2950804 Scan00010.tif|thumb|The beginning of 1485 Italian edition of ''Aesopus Moralisatus'']]\n\n===Fable as a genre===\n[[Apollonius of Tyana|Apollonius]] [[Tyana|of Tyana]], a 1st-century CE [[Philosophy|philosopher]], is recorded as having said about Aesop:\n\n{{Quote|...  like those who dine well off the plainest dishes, he made use of humble incidents to teach great truths, and after serving up a story he adds to it the advice to do a thing or not to do it. Then, too, he was really more attached to truth than the poets are; for the latter do violence to their own stories in order to make them probable; but he by announcing a story which everyone knows not to be true, told the truth by the very fact that he did not claim to be relating real events.|[[Philostratus]], ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', Book V:14}}\n\nThe [[Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] [[Herodotus]] mentioned in passing that \"Aesop the fable writer\" was a slave who lived in Ancient Greece during the 5th century BCE.<ref>''The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus''. trans. George Rawlinson, [http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks/pdf/hrdts.pdf Book I, p. 132] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819160734/http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks/pdf/hrdts.pdf |date=19 August 2006 }}</ref> Among references in other writers, [[Aristophanes]], in his comedy ''[[The Wasps]]'', represented the protagonist Philocleon as having learnt the \"absurdities\" of Aesop from conversation at banquets; [[Plato]] wrote in ''[[Phaedo]] ''that [[Socrates]] whiled away his time in prison turning some of Aesop's fables \"which he knew\" into verses. Nonetheless, for two main reasons \u2013 because numerous morals within Aesop's attributed fables contradict each other, and because ancient accounts of Aesop's life contradict each other \u2013 the modern view is that Aesop was not the originator of all those fables attributed to him.<ref>''Aesop's Fables'', ed. D.L. Ashliman, New York 2005, pp. xiii\u2013xv, xxv\u2013xxvi</ref> Instead, any fable tended to be ascribed to the name of Aesop if there was no known alternative literary source.<ref>Christos A. Zafiropoulos (2001).

They had to be short and unaffected;<ref>Zafiropoulos, ''Ethics in Aesop's Fables'', p. 4</ref> in addition, they are fictitious, useful to life and true to nature.<ref>G. J. Van Dijk (1997). ''Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi'', Leiden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKQFJduPIdcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=%22Hermog.%20Prog.%201%22&f=false p. 57]</ref> In them could be found talking animals and plants, although humans interacting only with humans figure in a few. Typically they might begin with a contextual introduction, followed by the story, often with the moral underlined at the end. Setting the context was often necessary as a guide to the story's interpretation, as in the case of the political meaning of [[The Frogs Who Desired a King]] and [[The Frogs and the Sun]].\n\nSometimes the titles given later to the fables have become proverbial, as in the case of killing [[the Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs]] or [[the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]. In fact some fables, such as [[The Young Man and the Swallow]], appear to have been invented as illustrations of already existing proverbs. One theorist, indeed, went so far as to define fables as extended proverbs.<ref>[[Francisco Rodr\u00edguez Adrados]] (1999). ''History of the Graeco-Latin Fable'' vol. 1, Leiden. [https://books.google.com/books?id=093Gl8KEktMC&lpg=PA7&vq=%22an%20extended%20proverb.%22%20Theocritus&pg=PA7#v=snippet&q=%22an%20extended%20proverb.%22%20Theocritus&f=false p. 7]</ref> In this they have an [[Etiology|aetiological]] function, the explaining of origins such as, in another context, [[The Ant and the Grasshopper#Fable and counter-fable|why the ant is a mean, thieving creature]] or [[Zeus and the Tortoise|how the tortoise got its shell]]. Other fables, also verging on this function, are outright jokes, as in the case of [[The Old Woman and the Doctor]], aimed at greedy practitioners of medicine.\n\n===Origins===\nThe contradictions between fables already mentioned and alternative versions of much the same fable \u2013 as in the case of [[The Woodcutter and the Trees]], are best explained by the ascription to Aesop of all examples of the genre. Some are demonstrably of West Asian origin, others have analogues further to the East. Modern scholarship reveals fables and proverbs of Aesopic form existing in both ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], as early as the [[third millennium BCE]].<ref name=\"Priest\">John F. Priest, \"The Dog in the Manger: In Quest of a Fable\", in ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 81, No. 1, (October\u2013November 1985), pp. 49\u201358.</ref> Aesop's fables and the Indian tradition, as represented by the Buddhist ''[[Jataka tales]]'' and the Hindu ''[[Panchatantra]]'', share about a dozen tales in common, although often widely differing in detail. There is some debate over whether the Greeks learned these fables from Indian storytellers or the other way, or if the influences were mutual.\n\nLoeb editor [[Perry Index|Ben E. Perry]] took the extreme position in his book ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965) that\n:in the entire Greek tradition there is not, so far as I can see, a single fable that can be said to come either directly or indirectly from an Indian source; but many fables or fable-motifs that first appear in Greek or Near Eastern literature are found later in the Panchatantra and other Indian story-books, including the Buddhist Jatakas.<ref>Perry, Ben E. (1965). \"Introduction\", ''Babrius and Phaedrus'', p. xix.</ref>\n\nAlthough Aesop and the Buddha were near contemporaries, the stories of neither were recorded in writing until some centuries after their death. Few disinterested scholars would now be prepared to make so absolute a stand as Perry about their origin in view of the conflicting and still emerging evidence.<ref>van Dijk, Gert-Jan (1997). ''Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi: Fables in Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek Literature'', Leiden, Netherlands: Brill.</ref><ref>Adrados, Francisco Rodr\u00edguez; van Dijk, Gert-Jan. (1999). ''History of the Graeco-Latin Fable'', 3 Volumes, Leiden, Netherlands: Brill.</ref>\n\n==Translation and transmission==\n\n===Greek versions===\n[[File:Babrius.jpg|thumb|A Greek manuscript of the fables of Babrius]]\nWhen and how the fables arrived in and travelled from ancient Greece remains uncertain. Some cannot be dated any earlier than [[Babrius]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], several centuries after Aesop, and yet others even later. The earliest mentioned collection was by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an Athenian orator and statesman of the 4th century BCE, who compiled the fables into a set of ten books for the use of orators. A follower of Aristotle, he simply catalogued all the fables that earlier Greek writers had used in isolation as exempla, putting them into prose. At least it was evidence of what was attributed to Aesop by others; but this may have included any ascription to him from the oral tradition in the way of animal fables, fictitious anecdotes, etiological or satirical myths, possibly even any proverb or joke, that these writers transmitted. It is more a proof of the power of Aesop's name to attract such stories to it than evidence of his actual authorship. In any case, although the work of Demetrius was mentioned frequently for the next twelve centuries, and was considered the official Aesop, no copy now survives. Present day collections evolved from the later Greek version of [[Babrius]], of which there now exists an incomplete manuscript of some 160 fables in [[choliamb]]ic verse. Current opinion is that he lived in the 1st century CE. The version of 55&nbsp;fables in choliambic [[tetrameter]]s by the 9th century Ignatius the Deacon is also worth mentioning for its early inclusion of tales from [[Orient]]al sources.<ref>Ashliman, D.L. \"Introduction\", ''Aesop's Fables'', 2003, p. xxii.</ref>\n\nFurther light is thrown on the entry of Oriental stories into the Aesopic canon by their appearance in Jewish sources such as the [[Talmud]] and in [[Midrash]]ic literature. There is a comparative list of these on the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/874-aesop-s-fables-among-the-jews|title=\u00c6sop's Fables Among the Jews|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> of which twelve resemble those that are common to both Greek and Indian sources, six are parallel to those only in Indian sources, and six others in Greek only. Where similar fables exist in Greece, India, and in the Talmud, the Talmudic form approaches more nearly the Indian. Thus, the fable \"[[The Wolf and the Crane]]\" is told in India of a lion and another bird. When [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] told that fable to the Jews, to prevent their rebelling against Rome and once more putting their heads into the lion's jaws (Gen. R. lxiv.), he shows familiarity with some form derived from India.\n\n===Latin versions===\n[[File:Aosta Sant orso Chiostro Capitello10 Lato Nord.jpg|thumb|left|12th-century pillar, cloister of the [[Sant'Orso|Collegiata di Sant'Orso]], [[Aosta]]: the Fox and the Stork]]\n\nThe first extensive translation of Aesop into [[Latin]] [[iambic trimeter]]s was performed by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], a [[freedman]] of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century CE, although at least one fable had already been translated by the poet [[Ennius]] two centuries before, and others are referred to in the work of [[Horace]]. The rhetorician [[Aphthonius of Antioch]] wrote a [[Progymnasmata|technical treatise]] on, and converted into Latin prose, some forty of these fables in 315. It is notable as illustrating contemporary and later usage of fables in rhetorical practice. Teachers of philosophy and rhetoric often set the fables of Aesop as an exercise for their scholars, inviting them not only to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practise style and the rules of grammar by making new versions of their own. A little later the poet [[Ausonius]] handed down some of these fables in verse, which the writer Julianus Titianus translated into prose, and in the early 5th century [[Avianus]] put 42 of these fables into Latin [[elegiac couplet|elegiacs]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=21ka6pWJ-pkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Progymnasmata: Greek Textbooks of Prose Composition and Rhetoric''], Brill 2003</ref>\n\nThe largest, oldest known and most influential of the prose versions of Phaedrus bears the name of an otherwise unknown fabulist named [[Romulus (fabulist)|Romulus]]. It contains 83 fables, dates from the 10th century and seems to have been based on an earlier prose version which, under the name of \"Aesop\" and addressed to one Rufus, may have been written in the [[Carolingian]] period or even earlier. The collection became the source from which, during the second half of the Middle Ages, almost all the collections of Latin fables in prose and verse were wholly or partially drawn. A version of the first three books of Romulus in elegiac verse, possibly made around the 12th century, was one of the most highly influential texts in medieval Europe. Referred to variously (among other titles) as the verse Romulus or elegiac Romulus, and ascribed to [[Gualterus Anglicus]], it was a common Latin teaching text and was popular well into the Renaissance. Another version of Romulus in Latin elegiacs was made by [[Alexander Neckam]], born at St Albans in 1157.<ref>\"Phaedrus\",[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Phaedrus ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' 1911]</ref>\n\nInterpretive \"translations\" of the elegiac Romulus were very common in Europe in the Middle Ages. Among the earliest was one in the 11th century by [[Ademar of Chabannes]], which includes some new material. This was followed by a prose collection of parables by the [[Cistercian]] preacher [[Odo of Cheriton]] around 1200 where the fables (many of which are not Aesopic) are given a strong medieval and clerical tinge. This interpretive tendency, and the inclusion of yet more non-Aesopic material, was to grow as versions in the various European vernaculars began to appear in the following centuries.\n\n[[File:Aesopus - Aesopus constructus, 1495.tiff|thumb|''Aesopus constructus'' etc., 1495 edition with metrical version of Fabulae Lib. I\u2013IV by [[Anonymus Neveleti]] ]]\nWith the revival of [[New Latin language|literary Latin]] during the Renaissance, authors began compiling collections of fables in which those traditionally by Aesop and those from other sources appeared side by side. One of the earliest was by Lorenzo Bevilaqua, also known as [[Laurentius Abstemius]], who wrote 197 fables,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1471359/abstemius |title=Accessible online |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> the first hundred of which were published as ''Hecatomythium'' in 1495. Little by Aesop was included. At the most, some traditional fables are adapted and reinterpreted: [[The Lion and the Mouse]] is continued and given a new ending (fable 52); [[The Oak and the Reed]] becomes \"The Elm and the Willow\" (53); [[The Ant and the Grasshopper]] is adapted as \"The Gnat and the Bee\" (94) with the difference that the gnat offers to teach music to the bee's children. There are also Mediaeval tales such as [[The Mice in Council]] (195) and stories created to support popular proverbs such as '[[Still Waters Run Deep (fable)|Still Waters Run Deep]]' (5) and 'A woman, an ass and a walnut tree' (65), where the latter refers back to Aesop's fable of [[The Walnut Tree]]. Most of the fables in ''Hecatomythium'' were later translated in the second half of [[Roger L'Estrange]]'s ''Fables of Aesop and other eminent mythologists'' (1692);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange |title=Accessible online |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> some also appeared among the 102 in H. Clarke's Latin reader, ''Select fables of Aesop: with an English translation'' (1787), of which there were both English and American editions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fabulaeaesopisel00clariala |title=Archived online |accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher=Boston : Printed by Samuel Hall, in State-Street |year=1787 }}</ref>\n\nThere were later three notable collections of fables in verse, among which the most influential was [[Gabriele Faerno]]'s ''Centum Fabulae'' (1564). The majority of the hundred fables there are Aesop's but there are also humorous tales such as [[The drowned woman and her husband]] (41) and [[The miller, his son and the donkey]] (100). In the same year that Faerno was published in Italy, [[Hieronymus Osius]] brought out a collection of 294 fables titled ''Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae'' in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472440/osius |title=Accessible online |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> This too contained some from elsewhere, such as [[The Dog in the Manger]] (67). Then in 1604 the Austrian Pantaleon Weiss, known as [[Pantaleon Candidus]], published ''Centum et Quinquaginta Fabulae''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472518/pantaleon |title=Pantaleon |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> The 152 poems there were grouped by subject, with sometimes more than one devoted to the same fable, although presenting alternative versions of it, as in the case of [[The Hawk and the Nightingale]] (133\u20135). It also includes the earliest instance of [[The Lion, the Bear and the Fox]] (60) in a language other than Greek.\n\nAnother voluminous collection of fables in Latin verse was [[Anthony Alsop]]'s ''Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus'' (Oxford 1698).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Fc-AAAAcAAJ|title=Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus|work=google.co.uk|last1=Aesopus|year=1698}}</ref> The bulk of the 237 fables there are prefaced by the text in Greek, while there are also a handful in Hebrew and in Arabic; the final fables, only attested from Latin sources, are without other versions. For the most part the poems are confined to a lean telling of the fable without  drawing a moral.\n\n==Aesop in other languages==\n\n===Europe===\nFor many centuries the main transmission of Aesop's fables across Europe remained in Latin or else orally in various vernaculars, where they mixed with folk tales derived from other sources. This mixing is often apparent in early vernacular collections of fables in mediaeval times.\n* ''[[Ysopet]]'', an adaptation of some of the fables into [[Old French]] [[octosyllabic]] couplets, was written by [[Marie de France]] in the 12th century.<ref>''The Fables of Marie de France'' translated by Mary Lou Martin, Birmingham AL, 1979; limited preview to p. 51 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6iHIlvyXpNQC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=marie+de+france++the+town+mouse+and+the+country+mouse&source=bl&ots=oTM-vAx8LP&sig=jj_0PdH1d4V3h16ZDQRyPRU4LlQ&hl=en&ei=QOj4S4SiBIXu0wSJssXpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]</ref> The morals with which she closes each fable reflect the feudal situation of her time.\n* In the 13th century the Jewish author [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] wrote ''Mishlei Shualim'', a collection of 103 'Fox Fables' in [[Hebrew]] rhymed prose. This included many animal tales passing under the name of Aesop, as well as several more derived from Marie de France and others. Berechiah's work adds a layer of Biblical quotations and allusions to the tales, adapting them as a way to teach Jewish ethics.

There had been many small selections in various languages during the Middle Ages but the first attempt at an exhaustive edition was made by [[Heinrich Steinhowel|Heinrich Steinh\u0151wel]] in his ''Esopus'', published {{circa|1476}}.

Fables began as an expression of the slave culture and their background is in the simplicity of agrarian life. Creole transmits this experience with greater purity than the urbane language of the slave-owner.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Slang===\nFables belong essentially to the oral tradition; they survive by being remembered and then retold in one's own words. When they are written down, particularly in the dominant language of instruction, they lose something of their essence. A strategy for reclaiming them is therefore to exploit the gap between the written and the spoken language. One of those who did this in English was Sir [[Roger L'Estrange]], who translated the fables into the racy urban slang of his day and further underlined their purpose by including in his collection many of the subversive Latin fables of [[Laurentius Abstemius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/index.htm |title=His ''Aesop. Fables'' (1692) |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> In France the fable tradition had already been renewed in the 17th century by La Fontaine's influential reinterpretations of Aesop and others. In the centuries that followed there were further reinterpretations through the medium of regional languages, which to those at the centre were regarded as little better than slang. Eventually, however, the demotic tongue of the cities themselves began to be appreciated as a literary medium.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of these urban slang translations was the series of individual fables contained in a single folded sheet, appearing under the title of ''Les Fables de Gibbs'' in 1929. Others written during the period were eventually anthologised as ''Fables de La Fontaine en argot'' (\u00c9toile sur Rh\u00f4ne 1989). This followed the genre's growth in popularity after World War II. Two short selections of fables by Bernard Gelval about 1945 were succeeded by two selections of 15 fables each by 'Marcus' (Paris 1947, reprinted in 1958 and 2006), Api Condret's ''Recueil des fables en argot'' (Paris, 1951) and G\u00e9o Sandry (1897\u20131975) and Jean Kolb's ''Fables en argot'' (Paris 1950/60).

G. Temple|Robert Temple]]'s Penguin edition is titled ''The Complete Fables by Aesop'' (1998) but in fact many from Babrius, Phaedrus and other major ancient sources have been omitted. More recently, in 2002 a translation by Laura Gibbs titled ''Aesop's Fables'' was published by Oxford World's Classics. This book includes 359 and has selections from all the major Greek and Latin sources.\n\nUntil the 18th century the fables were largely put to adult use by teachers, preachers, speech-makers and moralists. It was the philosopher [[John Locke]] who first seems to have advocated targeting children as a special audience in ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693). Aesop's fables, in his opinion are\n\n{{quote|apt to delight and entertain a child. . . yet afford useful reflection to a grown man. And if his memory retain them all his life after, he will not repent to find them there, amongst his manly thoughts and serious business. If his Aesop has pictures in it, it will entertain him much better, and encourage him to read when it carries the increase of knowledge with it For such visible objects children hear talked of in vain, and without any satisfaction, whilst they have no ideas of them; those ideas being not to be had from sounds, but from the things themselves, or their pictures.|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/37/1/16.html |title=Paragraph 156 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>}}\n\nThat young people are a special target for the fables was not a particularly new idea and a number of ingenious schemes for catering to that audience had already been put into practice in Europe. The ''Centum Fabulae'' of [[Gabriele Faerno]] was commissioned by [[Pope Pius IV]] in the 16th century 'so that children might learn, at the same time and from the same book, both moral and linguistic purity'. When King [[Louis XIV]] of France wanted to instruct his six-year-old son, he incorporated the series of hydraulic statues representing 38 chosen fables in [[the labyrinth of Versailles]] in the 1670s. In this he had been advised by [[Charles Perrault]], who was later to translate Faerno's widely published Latin poems into French verse and so bring them to a wider audience.<ref>The 1753 London reprint of this and Faerno's original Latin is available [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false online]</ref> Then in the 1730s appeared the eight volumes of ''Nouvelles Po\u00e9sies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs'', the first six of which incorporated a section of fables specifically aimed at children. In this the fables of La Fontaine were rewritten to fit popular airs of the day and arranged for simple performance. The preface to this work comments that 'we consider ourselves happy if, in giving them an attraction to useful lessons which are suited to their age, we have given them an aversion to the profane songs which are often put into their mouths and which only serve to corrupt their innocence.'<ref>John Metz, ''The Fables of La Fontaine, a critical edition of the 18th century settings'', New York 1986, pp. 3\u201310; [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVHRlG34Ub4C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Louis-Nicolas+Cl%C3%A9rambault++Fables+de+la+fontaine&source=bl&ots=EvNKcajVDr&sig=w425tjQ8hB5DqTHcBHvhf1cjqeU&hl=en&ei=PIJ9Ta7CDcjDhAf1oKXvBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q&f=false available on Google Books]</ref> The work was popular and reprinted into the following century.\n\nIn Great Britain various authors began to develop this new market in the 18th century, giving a brief outline of the story and what was usually a longer commentary on its moral and practical meaning.

One of the most popular was the writer of nonsense verse, Richard Scrafton Sharpe (died 1852), whose ''Old Friends in a New Dress: familiar fables in verse'' first appeared in 1807 and went through five steadily augmented editions until 1837.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oldfriendsinnewd00shariala |title=The 1820 3rd edition |year= 1820|accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher=London : Harvey and Darton, and William Darton }}</ref> Jefferys Taylor's ''Aesop in Rhyme, with some originals'', first published in 1820, was as popular and also went through several editions. The versions are lively but Taylor takes considerable liberties with the story line. Both authors were alive to the over serious nature of the 18th century collections and tried to remedy this. Sharpe in particular discussed the dilemma they presented and recommended a way round it, tilting at the same time at the format in Croxall's fable collection:\n\n{{quote|It has been the accustomed method in printing fables to divide the moral from the subject; and children, whose minds are alive to the entertainment of an amusing story, too often turn from one fable to another, rather than peruse the less interesting lines that come under the term \"Application\".

In France too, well-known illustrations of La Fontaine's fables were often used on china.<ref>See several examples at [http://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/tableware/specifickindsoftableware/plates/epinaldepellerin/index.php creighton.edu]</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Religious themes==\nIn Classical times there was an overlap between fable and myth, especially where they had an [[Etiology|aetiological]] function.<ref>H.J.Blackham, ''The Fable as Literature'', Bloomsbury Academic 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p79MAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=fable+as+aetiological+myth&source=bl&ots=AZIcFB5Y_C&sig=R7otoJ3vLSBUlkaYxSl6zxqkudg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EQdfVeCGLMz5Uuy4gMgF&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=fable%20as%20aetiological%20myth&f=false p.186]</ref> Among those are two which deal with the difference between humans and animals. According to the first, humans are distinguished by their rationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/240.htm|title=Zeus and Prometheus |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> But in those cases where they have a bestial mentality, the explanation is that at creation animals were found to outnumber humans and some were therefore modified in shape but retained their animal souls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/311.htm|title=Zeus and Man |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref>\n\nSuch early philosophical speculation was also extended to the ethical problems connected with divine justice. For example, it was perceived as disproportionate for an evil man to be punished by dying in a shipwreck when it involved many other innocent people. The god [[Hermes]] explained this to an objector by the human analogy of a man bitten by an ant and in consequence stamping on all those about his feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/306.htm|title=Hermes, the Man and the Ants |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> Again, it was asked why the consequences of an evil deed did not follow immediately it was committed. Hermes was involved here too, since he records men's acts on pot[[sherd]]s and takes them to [[Zeus]] piled in a box. The god of justice, however, goes through them in reverse order and the penalty may therefore be delayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/313.htm|title=Zeus and the Potsherds |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> However, where the fault is perceived as an act of defiance, as happens in the fable of [[Horkos]], retribution arrives swiftly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/239.htm|title=The Oath's Punishment |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hercules and the wagoner.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|A Japanese woodblock print illustrates the moral of Hercules and the Wagoner]]\nSome fables may express open scepticism, as in the story of the man marketing a [[The Statue of Hermes#4 The wish-fulfilling image|statue of Hermes]] who boasted of its effectiveness. Asked why he was disposing of such an asset, the huckster explains that the god takes his time in granting favours while he himself needs immediate cash. In another example, a farmer whose mattock has been stolen goes to a temple to see if the culprit can be found by divination. On his arrival he hears an announcement asking for information about a robbery at the temple and concludes that a god who cannot look after his own must be useless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/295.htm|title=The Farmer and his Mattock |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> But the contrary position, against reliance on religious ritual, was taken in fables like [[Hercules and the Wagoner]] that illustrate the proverb \"god helps those who help themselves\". The story was also to become a favourite centuries later in [[Protestant]] England, where one commentator took the extreme position that to neglect the necessity of self-help is \"blasphemy\" and that it is \"a great sin for a man to fail in his trade or occupation by running often to prayers\".<ref>Samuel Croxall, ''Fables of Aesop'', [https://archive.org/details/fablesaesopando02croxgoog/page/n140 <!-- pg=100 quote=croxall  Hercules and the Carter. --> Fable 56]</ref>\n\nAs the fables moved out of the Greek-speaking world and were adapted to different times and religions, it is notable how radically some fables were reinterpreted. Thus one of the fables collected under the title of the [[Lion's share]] and originally directed against tyranny became in the hands of [[Rumi]] a parable of oneness with [[the God of Islam]] and obedience to divine authority.<ref>Laura Gibbs, \"Rumi's fable of the Lion's Share\", ''Journey to the Sea'', [http://journeytothesea.com/rumi-lion October 1, 2008]</ref> In the Jewish 'fox fables' of [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]], the humorous account of [[the Frightened Hares|the hares and the frogs]] was made the occasion to recommend trust in God,<ref>''Fables of a Jewish Aesop'', Columbia University 1967,[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6EjsopJmp4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hounds&f=false Fable 38]</ref> while Christian reinterpretation of animal symbolism in Mediaeval times turned [[The Wolf and the Crane#Sculptural symbolism|The Wolf and the Crane]] into a parable of the rescue of the sinner's soul from [[Hell]].<ref>Evans, E.

''Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture'',  London, 1896, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/9075621/evans-animal-symbolism-in-ecclesiastical-architecture p. 107]</ref>\n\nIn Mediaeval times too, fables were collected for use in sermons, of which [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parobolae'' is just one example. At the start of the [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] followed his example in the work now known as the Coburg Fables.<ref>Jason D. Lane, review of ''Luther's Aesop'', [http://www.logia.org/logia-online/653 Logia, December 30, 2013]</ref> Another source of Christianized fables was in the [[emblem books]] of the 16th\u201317th centuries. In [[Georgette de Montenay]]'s ''Emblemes ou devises chrestiennes'' (1571), for example, the fable of [[The Oak and the Reed]] was depicted in the context of the lines from the [[Magnificat]], \"He hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree\" (Luke 1.52, AV).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FMOa058|title=French Emblems: Emblem: Deposuit Potent et Exaltavit|work=gla.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nOnce the fables were perceived as primarily for the instruction of children, a new generation of Christian writers began putting their own construction on them, often at odds with their original interpretation. An extreme example occurs in a compilation called ''Christian Fables'' from the Victorian era, where [[The North Wind and the Sun]] is referred to Biblical passages in which religion is compared to a cloak. Therefore, says the author, one should beware of abandoning one's beliefs under the sun of prosperity.<ref>Rev. Samuel Lysons, ''Christian Fables, or the fables of Aesop, and other writers, Christianized and adapted with Christian morals for the use of young people'', London 1850, [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AtcxAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA6, p.6]</ref> Demonstrably, the essence of fables is their adaptability. Beginning two and a half millennia ago with aetiological solutions to philosophical problems, fresh religious applications were continuing into the present.\n\n==Dramatised fables==\nThe success of La Fontaine's fables in France started a European fashion for creating plays around them. The originator was [[Edm\u00e9 Boursault]], with his five-act verse drama ''Les Fables d'Esope'' (1690), later retitled ''Esope \u00e0 la ville'' (Aesop in town). Such was its popularity that a rival theatre produced [[Eustache Le Noble]]'s ''Arlaquin-Esope'' in the following year. Boursault then wrote a sequel, ''Esope \u00e0 la cour'' (Aesop at court), a heroic comedy that was held up by the censors and not produced until after his death in 1701.<ref>Honor\u00e9 Champion, ''R\u00e9pertoire Chronologique des Spectacles \u00e0 Paris, 1680\u20131715'', (2002); [http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/spielmag/finderegne/repertoire2.htm#top georgetown.edu]</ref> Other 18th-century imitations included [[Jean-Antoine du Cerceau]]'s ''Esope au coll\u00e8ge'' (1715),<ref>[https://archive.org/details/oeuvresdeducerce01duceuoft/page/162 Archived online]</ref> where being put in charge of a school gives the fabulist ample opportunity to tell his stories, and [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Pesselier]]'s ''Esope au Parnasse'' (1739), a one-act piece in verse.<ref>[http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/programmes/edition.php?t=..%2Fdocuments%2FPESSELIER_ESOPEAUPARNASSE.xml Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Classique]</ref>\n\n''Esope \u00e0 la ville'' was written in [[French alexandrine]] [[couplet]]s and depicted a physically ugly Aesop acting as adviser to Learchus, governor of [[Cyzicus]] under [[King Croesus]], and using his fables as satirical comments on those seeking his favour or to solve romantic problems. One of the problems is personal to Aesop, since he is betrothed to the governor's daughter, who detests him and has a young admirer with whom she is in love. There is very little action, the play serving as a platform for the recitation of [[free verse]] fables at frequent intervals. These include [[The Fox and the Weasel]], [[The Fox and the Mask]], [[The Belly and the Other Members]], [[the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]], [[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|the Fox and the Crow]], [[The Snake and the Crab|the Crab and her Daughter]], [[The Frog and the Ox]], [[The Swan and the Goose|the Cook and the Swan]], [[The Wolf and the Lamb]], [[The Mountain in Labour]], and [[The Man with two Mistresses]].

The same translator was responsible for a version of ''Esope \u00e0 la ville'' (''Esopo in citt\u00e0'', Venice, 1748); then in 1798 there was an anonymous Venetian three-act adaptation, ''Le Favole di Esopa, ossia Esopo in citt\u00e0''.<ref>Giovanni Saverio Santangelo, Claudio Vinti, ''Le traduzioni italiane del teatro comico francese dei secoli XVII e XVIII'', Rome 1981, p.97, available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=G6af7qli7XcC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=Gasparo+Gozzi:+Esopo+alla+Corte+%281747%29&source=bl&ots=rCsBkc0R2S&sig=sib4rtnEaapOf215wcpTcSaTO0Y&hl=en&ei=NqCYTbLsKImqhAeM6vHhCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Gasparo%20Gozzi%3A%20Esopo%20alla%20Corte%20%281747%29&f=false books.google.co.uk]</ref> In England the play was adapted under the title ''Aesop'' by [[John Vanbrugh]] and first performed at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London in 1697, remaining popular for the next twenty years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/playsvanbrugh01vanbuoft#page/216/mode/2up |title=The play is archived online |accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher=J.

Cartoonist [[Terrytoons|Paul Terry]] began his own series, called ''[[Aesop's Film Fables]]'', in 1921 but by the time this was taken over by [[Van Beuren Studios]] in 1928 the story lines had little connection with any fable of Aesop's. In the early 1960s, animator [[Jay Ward]] created a television series of short cartoons called ''[[Aesop and Son]]'' which were first aired as part of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''. Actual fables were spoofed to result in a pun based on the original moral. Two fables are also featured in the 1971 TV movie ''Aesop's Fables'' in the US. Here Aesop is a black story teller who relates two turtle fables, [[The Tortoise and the Birds|The Tortoise and the Eagle]] and [[the Tortoise and the Hare]] to a couple of children who wander into an enchanted grove. The fables themselves are shown as cartoons.<ref>The 24-minute feature is divided into three parts on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jON9jB6KPws YouTube]</ref>\n\nBetween 1989 and 1991, fifty Aesop-based fables were reinterpreted on French television as {{Interlanguage link multi|Les Fables g\u00e9om\u00e9triques|fr|3=Les Fables g\u00e9om\u00e9triques}} and later issued on DVD.

Among these was Canadian writer [[Robertson Davies]]' ''A Masque of Aesop'' (1952), which was set at his trial in Delphi and allows the defendant to tell the fables ''[[The Belly and the Members]]'', ''[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]'' and ''[[The Cock and the Jewel]]'' while challenging prevailing social attitudes.<ref>Susan Stone-Blackburn, ''Robertson Davies, playwright'', University of British Columbia 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2wSfrq9cM_QC&lpg=PA93&dq=%22Aesop%20at%20%22&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q=Masque&f=false pp. 92\u201396]</ref>\n\n==Musical treatments==\nWhile musical settings of La Fontaine's Fables began appearing in France within a few decades of their publication, it was not until the 19th century that composers began to take their inspiration directly from Aesop.

Of diverse origins, the stories associated with his name have descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] and in popular as well as artistic media.\n\nThe fables originally belonged to the [[oral tradition]] and were not collected for some three centuries after Aesop's death. By that time a variety of other stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present, with some of the fables unrecorded before the [[Late Middle Ages]] and others arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories are still being added to the Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors.\n\nManuscripts in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were important avenues of transmission, although poetical treatments in European vernaculars eventually formed another.  On the arrival of printing, collections of Aesop's fables were among the earliest books in a variety of languages. Through the means of later collections, and translations or adaptations of them, Aesop's reputation as a fabulist was transmitted throughout the world.\n\nInitially the fables were addressed to adults and covered religious, social and political themes. They were also put to use as ethical guides and from the [[Renaissance]] onwards were particularly used for the education of children. Their ethical dimension was reinforced in the adult world through depiction in sculpture, painting and other illustrative means, as well as adaptation to drama and song. In addition, there have been reinterpretations of the meaning of fables and changes in emphasis over time.\n\n==Fictions that point to the truth==\n[[File:Aesopus - Aesopus moralisatus, circa 1485 - 2950804 Scan00010.tif|thumb|The beginning of 1485 Italian edition of ''Aesopus Moralisatus'']]\n\n===Fable as a genre===\n[[Apollonius of Tyana|Apollonius]] [[Tyana|of Tyana]], a 1st-century CE [[Philosophy|philosopher]], is recorded as having said about Aesop:\n\n{{Quote|...  like those who dine well off the plainest dishes, he made use of humble incidents to teach great truths, and after serving up a story he adds to it the advice to do a thing or not to do it. Then, too, he was really more attached to truth than the poets are; for the latter do violence to their own stories in order to make them probable; but he by announcing a story which everyone knows not to be true, told the truth by the very fact that he did not claim to be relating real events.|[[Philostratus]], ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', Book V:14}}\n\nThe [[Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] [[Herodotus]] mentioned in passing that \"Aesop the fable writer\" was a slave who lived in Ancient Greece during the 5th century BCE.<ref>''The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus''. trans. George Rawlinson, [http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks/pdf/hrdts.pdf Book I, p. 132] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819160734/http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks/pdf/hrdts.pdf |date=19 August 2006 }}</ref> Among references in other writers, [[Aristophanes]], in his comedy ''[[The Wasps]]'', represented the protagonist Philocleon as having learnt the \"absurdities\" of Aesop from conversation at banquets; [[Plato]] wrote in ''[[Phaedo]] ''that [[Socrates]] whiled away his time in prison turning some of Aesop's fables \"which he knew\" into verses. Nonetheless, for two main reasons \u2013 because numerous morals within Aesop's attributed fables contradict each other, and because ancient accounts of Aesop's life contradict each other \u2013 the modern view is that Aesop was not the originator of all those fables attributed to him.<ref>''Aesop's Fables'', ed. D.L. Ashliman, New York 2005, pp. xiii\u2013xv, xxv\u2013xxvi</ref> Instead, any fable tended to be ascribed to the name of Aesop if there was no known alternative literary source.<ref>Christos A.

They had to be short and unaffected;<ref>Zafiropoulos, ''Ethics in Aesop's Fables'', p. 4</ref> in addition, they are fictitious, useful to life and true to nature.<ref>G. J. Van Dijk (1997). ''Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi'', Leiden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKQFJduPIdcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=%22Hermog.%20Prog.%201%22&f=false p. 57]</ref> In them could be found talking animals and plants, although humans interacting only with humans figure in a few. Typically they might begin with a contextual introduction, followed by the story, often with the moral underlined at the end. Setting the context was often necessary as a guide to the story's interpretation, as in the case of the political meaning of [[The Frogs Who Desired a King]] and [[The Frogs and the Sun]].\n\nSometimes the titles given later to the fables have become proverbial, as in the case of killing [[the Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs]] or [[the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]. In fact some fables, such as [[The Young Man and the Swallow]], appear to have been invented as illustrations of already existing proverbs.

Other fables, also verging on this function, are outright jokes, as in the case of [[The Old Woman and the Doctor]], aimed at greedy practitioners of medicine.\n\n===Origins===\nThe contradictions between fables already mentioned and alternative versions of much the same fable \u2013 as in the case of [[The Woodcutter and the Trees]], are best explained by the ascription to Aesop of all examples of the genre. Some are demonstrably of West Asian origin, others have analogues further to the East. Modern scholarship reveals fables and proverbs of Aesopic form existing in both ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], as early as the [[third millennium BCE]].<ref name=\"Priest\">John F.

There is some debate over whether the Greeks learned these fables from Indian storytellers or the other way, or if the influences were mutual.\n\nLoeb editor [[Perry Index|Ben E. Perry]] took the extreme position in his book ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965) that\n:in the entire Greek tradition there is not, so far as I can see, a single fable that can be said to come either directly or indirectly from an Indian source; but many fables or fable-motifs that first appear in Greek or Near Eastern literature are found later in the Panchatantra and other Indian story-books, including the Buddhist Jatakas.<ref>Perry, Ben E. (1965). \"Introduction\", ''Babrius and Phaedrus'', p. xix.</ref>\n\nAlthough Aesop and the Buddha were near contemporaries, the stories of neither were recorded in writing until some centuries after their death. Few disinterested scholars would now be prepared to make so absolute a stand as Perry about their origin in view of the conflicting and still emerging evidence.<ref>van Dijk, Gert-Jan (1997).

''History of the Graeco-Latin Fable'', 3 Volumes, Leiden, Netherlands: Brill.</ref>\n\n==Translation and transmission==\n\n===Greek versions===\n[[File:Babrius.jpg|thumb|A Greek manuscript of the fables of Babrius]]\nWhen and how the fables arrived in and travelled from ancient Greece remains uncertain. Some cannot be dated any earlier than [[Babrius]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], several centuries after Aesop, and yet others even later. The earliest mentioned collection was by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an Athenian orator and statesman of the 4th century BCE, who compiled the fables into a set of ten books for the use of orators. A follower of Aristotle, he simply catalogued all the fables that earlier Greek writers had used in isolation as exempla, putting them into prose. At least it was evidence of what was attributed to Aesop by others; but this may have included any ascription to him from the oral tradition in the way of animal fables, fictitious anecdotes, etiological or satirical myths, possibly even any proverb or joke, that these writers transmitted. It is more a proof of the power of Aesop's name to attract such stories to it than evidence of his actual authorship. In any case, although the work of Demetrius was mentioned frequently for the next twelve centuries, and was considered the official Aesop, no copy now survives. Present day collections evolved from the later Greek version of [[Babrius]], of which there now exists an incomplete manuscript of some 160 fables in [[choliamb]]ic verse. Current opinion is that he lived in the 1st century CE. The version of 55&nbsp;fables in choliambic [[tetrameter]]s by the 9th century Ignatius the Deacon is also worth mentioning for its early inclusion of tales from [[Orient]]al sources.<ref>Ashliman, D.L. \"Introduction\", ''Aesop's Fables'', 2003, p. xxii.</ref>\n\nFurther light is thrown on the entry of Oriental stories into the Aesopic canon by their appearance in Jewish sources such as the [[Talmud]] and in [[Midrash]]ic literature. There is a comparative list of these on the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/874-aesop-s-fables-among-the-jews|title=\u00c6sop's Fables Among the Jews|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> of which twelve resemble those that are common to both Greek and Indian sources, six are parallel to those only in Indian sources, and six others in Greek only. Where similar fables exist in Greece, India, and in the Talmud, the Talmudic form approaches more nearly the Indian. Thus, the fable \"[[The Wolf and the Crane]]\" is told in India of a lion and another bird. When [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] told that fable to the Jews, to prevent their rebelling against Rome and once more putting their heads into the lion's jaws (Gen. R. lxiv.), he shows familiarity with some form derived from India.\n\n===Latin versions===\n[[File:Aosta Sant orso Chiostro Capitello10 Lato Nord.jpg|thumb|left|12th-century pillar, cloister of the [[Sant'Orso|Collegiata di Sant'Orso]], [[Aosta]]: the Fox and the Stork]]\n\nThe first extensive translation of Aesop into [[Latin]] [[iambic trimeter]]s was performed by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], a [[freedman]] of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century CE, although at least one fable had already been translated by the poet [[Ennius]] two centuries before, and others are referred to in the work of [[Horace]]. The rhetorician [[Aphthonius of Antioch]] wrote a [[Progymnasmata|technical treatise]] on, and converted into Latin prose, some forty of these fables in 315. It is notable as illustrating contemporary and later usage of fables in rhetorical practice. Teachers of philosophy and rhetoric often set the fables of Aesop as an exercise for their scholars, inviting them not only to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practise style and the rules of grammar by making new versions of their own. A little later the poet [[Ausonius]] handed down some of these fables in verse, which the writer Julianus Titianus translated into prose, and in the early 5th century [[Avianus]] put 42 of these fables into Latin [[elegiac couplet|elegiacs]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=21ka6pWJ-pkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Progymnasmata: Greek Textbooks of Prose Composition and Rhetoric''], Brill 2003</ref>\n\nThe largest, oldest known and most influential of the prose versions of Phaedrus bears the name of an otherwise unknown fabulist named [[Romulus (fabulist)|Romulus]]. It contains 83 fables, dates from the 10th century and seems to have been based on an earlier prose version which, under the name of \"Aesop\" and addressed to one Rufus, may have been written in the [[Carolingian]] period or even earlier. The collection became the source from which, during the second half of the Middle Ages, almost all the collections of Latin fables in prose and verse were wholly or partially drawn. A version of the first three books of Romulus in elegiac verse, possibly made around the 12th century, was one of the most highly influential texts in medieval Europe. Referred to variously (among other titles) as the verse Romulus or elegiac Romulus, and ascribed to [[Gualterus Anglicus]], it was a common Latin teaching text and was popular well into the Renaissance. Another version of Romulus in Latin elegiacs was made by [[Alexander Neckam]], born at St Albans in 1157.<ref>\"Phaedrus\",[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Phaedrus ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' 1911]</ref>\n\nInterpretive \"translations\" of the elegiac Romulus were very common in Europe in the Middle Ages. Among the earliest was one in the 11th century by [[Ademar of Chabannes]], which includes some new material. This was followed by a prose collection of parables by the [[Cistercian]] preacher [[Odo of Cheriton]] around 1200 where the fables (many of which are not Aesopic) are given a strong medieval and clerical tinge. This interpretive tendency, and the inclusion of yet more non-Aesopic material, was to grow as versions in the various European vernaculars began to appear in the following centuries.\n\n[[File:Aesopus - Aesopus constructus, 1495.tiff|thumb|''Aesopus constructus'' etc., 1495 edition with metrical version of Fabulae Lib. I\u2013IV by [[Anonymus Neveleti]] ]]\nWith the revival of [[New Latin language|literary Latin]] during the Renaissance, authors began compiling collections of fables in which those traditionally by Aesop and those from other sources appeared side by side. One of the earliest was by Lorenzo Bevilaqua, also known as [[Laurentius Abstemius]], who wrote 197 fables,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1471359/abstemius |title=Accessible online |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> the first hundred of which were published as ''Hecatomythium'' in 1495. Little by Aesop was included. At the most, some traditional fables are adapted and reinterpreted: [[The Lion and the Mouse]] is continued and given a new ending (fable 52); [[The Oak and the Reed]] becomes \"The Elm and the Willow\" (53); [[The Ant and the Grasshopper]] is adapted as \"The Gnat and the Bee\" (94) with the difference that the gnat offers to teach music to the bee's children. There are also Mediaeval tales such as [[The Mice in Council]] (195) and stories created to support popular proverbs such as '[[Still Waters Run Deep (fable)|Still Waters Run Deep]]' (5) and 'A woman, an ass and a walnut tree' (65), where the latter refers back to Aesop's fable of [[The Walnut Tree]]. Most of the fables in ''Hecatomythium'' were later translated in the second half of [[Roger L'Estrange]]'s ''Fables of Aesop and other eminent mythologists'' (1692);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange |title=Accessible online |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> some also appeared among the 102 in H. Clarke's Latin reader, ''Select fables of Aesop: with an English translation'' (1787), of which there were both English and American editions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fabulaeaesopisel00clariala |title=Archived online |accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher=Boston : Printed by Samuel Hall, in State-Street |year=1787 }}</ref>\n\nThere were later three notable collections of fables in verse, among which the most influential was [[Gabriele Faerno]]'s ''Centum Fabulae'' (1564). The majority of the hundred fables there are Aesop's but there are also humorous tales such as [[The drowned woman and her husband]] (41) and [[The miller, his son and the donkey]] (100). In the same year that Faerno was published in Italy, [[Hieronymus Osius]] brought out a collection of 294 fables titled ''Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae'' in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472440/osius |title=Accessible online |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> This too contained some from elsewhere, such as [[The Dog in the Manger]] (67). Then in 1604 the Austrian Pantaleon Weiss, known as [[Pantaleon Candidus]], published ''Centum et Quinquaginta Fabulae''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472518/pantaleon |title=Pantaleon |publisher=Aesopus.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> The 152 poems there were grouped by subject, with sometimes more than one devoted to the same fable, although presenting alternative versions of it, as in the case of [[The Hawk and the Nightingale]] (133\u20135). It also includes the earliest instance of [[The Lion, the Bear and the Fox]] (60) in a language other than Greek.\n\nAnother voluminous collection of fables in Latin verse was [[Anthony Alsop]]'s ''Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus'' (Oxford 1698).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Fc-AAAAcAAJ|title=Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus|work=google.co.uk|last1=Aesopus|year=1698}}</ref> The bulk of the 237 fables there are prefaced by the text in Greek, while there are also a handful in Hebrew and in Arabic; the final fables, only attested from Latin sources, are without other versions. For the most part the poems are confined to a lean telling of the fable without  drawing a moral.\n\n==Aesop in other languages==\n\n===Europe===\nFor many centuries the main transmission of Aesop's fables across Europe remained in Latin or else orally in various vernaculars, where they mixed with folk tales derived from other sources. This mixing is often apparent in early vernacular collections of fables in mediaeval times.\n* ''[[Ysopet]]'', an adaptation of some of the fables into [[Old French]] [[octosyllabic]] couplets, was written by [[Marie de France]] in the 12th century.<ref>''The Fables of Marie de France'' translated by Mary Lou Martin, Birmingham AL, 1979; limited preview to p. 51 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6iHIlvyXpNQC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=marie+de+france++the+town+mouse+and+the+country+mouse&source=bl&ots=oTM-vAx8LP&sig=jj_0PdH1d4V3h16ZDQRyPRU4LlQ&hl=en&ei=QOj4S4SiBIXu0wSJssXpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]</ref> The morals with which she closes each fable reflect the feudal situation of her time.\n* In the 13th century the Jewish author [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] wrote ''Mishlei Shualim'', a collection of 103 'Fox Fables' in [[Hebrew]] rhymed prose. This included many animal tales passing under the name of Aesop, as well as several more derived from Marie de France and others. Berechiah's work adds a layer of Biblical quotations and allusions to the tales, adapting them as a way to teach Jewish ethics.

Fables began as an expression of the slave culture and their background is in the simplicity of agrarian life. Creole transmits this experience with greater purity than the urbane language of the slave-owner.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Slang===\nFables belong essentially to the oral tradition; they survive by being remembered and then retold in one's own words. When they are written down, particularly in the dominant language of instruction, they lose something of their essence. A strategy for reclaiming them is therefore to exploit the gap between the written and the spoken language. One of those who did this in English was Sir [[Roger L'Estrange]], who translated the fables into the racy urban slang of his day and further underlined their purpose by including in his collection many of the subversive Latin fables of [[Laurentius Abstemius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/index.htm |title=His ''Aesop. Fables'' (1692) |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> In France the fable tradition had already been renewed in the 17th century by La Fontaine's influential reinterpretations of Aesop and others. In the centuries that followed there were further reinterpretations through the medium of regional languages, which to those at the centre were regarded as little better than slang. Eventually, however, the demotic tongue of the cities themselves began to be appreciated as a literary medium.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of these urban slang translations was the series of individual fables contained in a single folded sheet, appearing under the title of ''Les Fables de Gibbs'' in 1929. Others written during the period were eventually anthologised as ''Fables de La Fontaine en argot'' (\u00c9toile sur Rh\u00f4ne 1989). This followed the genre's growth in popularity after World War II. Two short selections of fables by Bernard Gelval about 1945 were succeeded by two selections of 15 fables each by 'Marcus' (Paris 1947, reprinted in 1958 and 2006), Api Condret's ''Recueil des fables en argot'' (Paris, 1951) and G\u00e9o Sandry (1897\u20131975) and Jean Kolb's ''Fables en argot'' (Paris 1950/60).

G. Temple|Robert Temple]]'s Penguin edition is titled ''The Complete Fables by Aesop'' (1998) but in fact many from Babrius, Phaedrus and other major ancient sources have been omitted. More recently, in 2002 a translation by Laura Gibbs titled ''Aesop's Fables'' was published by Oxford World's Classics. This book includes 359 and has selections from all the major Greek and Latin sources.\n\nUntil the 18th century the fables were largely put to adult use by teachers, preachers, speech-makers and moralists. It was the philosopher [[John Locke]] who first seems to have advocated targeting children as a special audience in ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693). Aesop's fables, in his opinion are\n\n{{quote|apt to delight and entertain a child. . . yet afford useful reflection to a grown man. And if his memory retain them all his life after, he will not repent to find them there, amongst his manly thoughts and serious business. If his Aesop has pictures in it, it will entertain him much better, and encourage him to read when it carries the increase of knowledge with it For such visible objects children hear talked of in vain, and without any satisfaction, whilst they have no ideas of them; those ideas being not to be had from sounds, but from the things themselves, or their pictures.|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/37/1/16.html |title=Paragraph 156 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>}}\n\nThat young people are a special target for the fables was not a particularly new idea and a number of ingenious schemes for catering to that audience had already been put into practice in Europe. The ''Centum Fabulae'' of [[Gabriele Faerno]] was commissioned by [[Pope Pius IV]] in the 16th century 'so that children might learn, at the same time and from the same book, both moral and linguistic purity'. When King [[Louis XIV]] of France wanted to instruct his six-year-old son, he incorporated the series of hydraulic statues representing 38 chosen fables in [[the labyrinth of Versailles]] in the 1670s. In this he had been advised by [[Charles Perrault]], who was later to translate Faerno's widely published Latin poems into French verse and so bring them to a wider audience.<ref>The 1753 London reprint of this and Faerno's original Latin is available [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false online]</ref> Then in the 1730s appeared the eight volumes of ''Nouvelles Po\u00e9sies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs'', the first six of which incorporated a section of fables specifically aimed at children. In this the fables of La Fontaine were rewritten to fit popular airs of the day and arranged for simple performance. The preface to this work comments that 'we consider ourselves happy if, in giving them an attraction to useful lessons which are suited to their age, we have given them an aversion to the profane songs which are often put into their mouths and which only serve to corrupt their innocence.'<ref>John Metz, ''The Fables of La Fontaine, a critical edition of the 18th century settings'', New York 1986, pp. 3\u201310; [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVHRlG34Ub4C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Louis-Nicolas+Cl%C3%A9rambault++Fables+de+la+fontaine&source=bl&ots=EvNKcajVDr&sig=w425tjQ8hB5DqTHcBHvhf1cjqeU&hl=en&ei=PIJ9Ta7CDcjDhAf1oKXvBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q&f=false available on Google Books]</ref> The work was popular and reprinted into the following century.\n\nIn Great Britain various authors began to develop this new market in the 18th century, giving a brief outline of the story and what was usually a longer commentary on its moral and practical meaning.

First published in 1722, with engravings for each fable by [[Elisha Kirkall]], it was continually reprinted into the second half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LsMqAAAAYAAJ|title=The 1835 edition is available on Google Books |accessdate=22 March 2012|last1=Aesop |year=1835 }}</ref> Another popular collection was [[John Newbery]]'s ''Fables in Verse for the Improvement of the Young and the Old'', facetiously attributed to Abraham Aesop Esquire, which was to see ten editions after its first publication in 1757.<ref>There is a description of the 5th edition, now in the Douce Collection at Oxford University's Bodleian Library, [http://www.rarebookroom.org/pdfDescriptions/heafab.pdf online]</ref> [[Robert Dodsley]]'s three-volume ''Select Fables of Esop and other Fabulists'' is distinguished for several reasons. First that it was printed in Birmingham by [[John Baskerville]] in 1761; second that it appealed to children by having the animals speak in character, the Lion in regal style, the Owl with 'pomp of phrase';<ref>See the introductory \"An Essay on Fable\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUwPAAAAIAAJ p.lxx]</ref> thirdly because it gathers into three sections fables from ancient sources, those that are more recent (including some borrowed from [[Jean de la Fontaine]]), and new stories of his own invention.\n\n[[Thomas Bewick]]'s editions from Newcastle upon Tyne are equally distinguished for the quality of his woodcuts. The first of those under his name was the ''Select Fables in Three Parts'' published in 1784.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/selectfableswit00brocgoog |quote=Thomas Bewick. |title=The 1820 edition of this is available on Internet Archive |publisher=Printed by S.

The work is divided into three sections: the first has some of Dodsley's fables prefaced by a short prose moral; the second has 'Fables with Reflections', in which each story is followed by a prose and a verse moral and then a lengthy prose reflection; the third, 'Fables in Verse', includes fables from other sources in poems by several unnamed authors; in these the moral is incorporated into the body of the poem.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/bewicksselectfab00aesouoft#page/n3/mode/2up |title=Beckwith's Select Fables|via=Google Books |year= 1871|accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher= Bickers |location=London }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century authors turned to writing verse specifically for children and included fables in their output. One of the most popular was the writer of nonsense verse, Richard Scrafton Sharpe (died 1852), whose ''Old Friends in a New Dress: familiar fables in verse'' first appeared in 1807 and went through five steadily augmented editions until 1837.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oldfriendsinnewd00shariala |title=The 1820 3rd edition |year= 1820|accessdate=22 March 2012|publisher=London : Harvey and Darton, and William Darton }}</ref> Jefferys Taylor's ''Aesop in Rhyme, with some originals'', first published in 1820, was as popular and also went through several editions. The versions are lively but Taylor takes considerable liberties with the story line. Both authors were alive to the over serious nature of the 18th century collections and tried to remedy this. Sharpe in particular discussed the dilemma they presented and recommended a way round it, tilting at the same time at the format in Croxall's fable collection:\n\n{{quote|It has been the accustomed method in printing fables to divide the moral from the subject; and children, whose minds are alive to the entertainment of an amusing story, too often turn from one fable to another, rather than peruse the less interesting lines that come under the term \"Application\".

This was in a magnificently hand-produced [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] edition, ''The Baby's Own Aesop: being the fables condensed in rhyme with portable morals pictorially pointed by [[Walter Crane]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookReader?bookid=crababy_00150086&twoPage=false&route=text&size=0&fullscreen=false&pnum1=1&lang=English&ilang=English |title=Children's Library reproduction |publisher=Childrenslibrary.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome later prose editions were particularly notable for their illustrations. Among these was ''Aesop's fables: a new version, chiefly from original sources'' (1848) by Thomas James, 'with more than one hundred illustrations designed by [[John Tenniel]]'.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlhMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=aesop%27s+fables+tenniel#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Aesop's fables: A new version, chiefly from original sources |accessdate=22 March 2012|last1=James |first1=Thomas |year=1852 }}</ref> Tenniel himself did not think highly of his work there and took the opportunity to redraw some in the revised edition of 1884, which also used pictures by [[Ernest Griset]] and [[Harrison Weir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/aesop1884/index.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref>  Once the technology was in place for coloured reproductions, illustrations became ever more attractive. Notable early 20th century editions include V.S.

In the 18th century they appear on tableware from the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Wedgwood]] and Fenton potteries, for example.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?offset=0&limit=45&narrow=0&q=aesop%27s+fables&commit=Search&quality=0&objectnamesearch=&placesearch=&after=&after-adbc=AD&before=&before-adbc=AD&namesearch=&materialsearch=&mnsearch=&locationsearch |title=The Victoria & Albert Museum has many examples |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> 19th century examples with a definitely educational aim include the fable series used on the alphabet plates issued in great numbers from the Brownhills Pottery in Staffordshire. Fables were used equally early in the design of tiles to surround the nursery fireplace. The latter were even more popular in the 19th century when there were specially designed series from [[Mintons]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/tiles/mintonsbluetiles/index.php |title=Creighton.edu |publisher=Creighton.edu |date= |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> Minton-Hollins and Maw & Co.

According to the first, humans are distinguished by their rationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/240.htm|title=Zeus and Prometheus |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> But in those cases where they have a bestial mentality, the explanation is that at creation animals were found to outnumber humans and some were therefore modified in shape but retained their animal souls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/311.htm|title=Zeus and Man |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref>\n\nSuch early philosophical speculation was also extended to the ethical problems connected with divine justice. For example, it was perceived as disproportionate for an evil man to be punished by dying in a shipwreck when it involved many other innocent people. The god [[Hermes]] explained this to an objector by the human analogy of a man bitten by an ant and in consequence stamping on all those about his feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/306.htm|title=Hermes, the Man and the Ants |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> Again, it was asked why the consequences of an evil deed did not follow immediately it was committed. Hermes was involved here too, since he records men's acts on pot[[sherd]]s and takes them to [[Zeus]] piled in a box. The god of justice, however, goes through them in reverse order and the penalty may therefore be delayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/313.htm|title=Zeus and the Potsherds |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> However, where the fault is perceived as an act of defiance, as happens in the fable of [[Horkos]], retribution arrives swiftly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/239.htm|title=The Oath's Punishment |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hercules and the wagoner.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|A Japanese woodblock print illustrates the moral of Hercules and the Wagoner]]\nSome fables may express open scepticism, as in the story of the man marketing a [[The Statue of Hermes#4 The wish-fulfilling image|statue of Hermes]] who boasted of its effectiveness. Asked why he was disposing of such an asset, the huckster explains that the god takes his time in granting favours while he himself needs immediate cash. In another example, a farmer whose mattock has been stolen goes to a temple to see if the culprit can be found by divination. On his arrival he hears an announcement asking for information about a robbery at the temple and concludes that a god who cannot look after his own must be useless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/295.htm|title=The Farmer and his Mattock |work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> But the contrary position, against reliance on religious ritual, was taken in fables like [[Hercules and the Wagoner]] that illustrate the proverb \"god helps those who help themselves\". The story was also to become a favourite centuries later in [[Protestant]] England, where one commentator took the extreme position that to neglect the necessity of self-help is \"blasphemy\" and that it is \"a great sin for a man to fail in his trade or occupation by running often to prayers\".<ref>Samuel Croxall, ''Fables of Aesop'', [https://archive.org/details/fablesaesopando02croxgoog/page/n140 <!-- pg=100 quote=croxall  Hercules and the Carter. --> Fable 56]</ref>\n\nAs the fables moved out of the Greek-speaking world and were adapted to different times and religions, it is notable how radically some fables were reinterpreted. Thus one of the fables collected under the title of the [[Lion's share]] and originally directed against tyranny became in the hands of [[Rumi]] a parable of oneness with [[the God of Islam]] and obedience to divine authority.<ref>Laura Gibbs, \"Rumi's fable of the Lion's Share\", ''Journey to the Sea'', [http://journeytothesea.com/rumi-lion October 1, 2008]</ref> In the Jewish 'fox fables' of [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]], the humorous account of [[the Frightened Hares|the hares and the frogs]] was made the occasion to recommend trust in God,<ref>''Fables of a Jewish Aesop'', Columbia University 1967,[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6EjsopJmp4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hounds&f=false Fable 38]</ref> while Christian reinterpretation of animal symbolism in Mediaeval times turned [[The Wolf and the Crane#Sculptural symbolism|The Wolf and the Crane]] into a parable of the rescue of the sinner's soul from [[Hell]].<ref>Evans, E. P. ''Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture'',  London, 1896, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/9075621/evans-animal-symbolism-in-ecclesiastical-architecture p. 107]</ref>\n\nIn Mediaeval times too, fables were collected for use in sermons, of which [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parobolae'' is just one example. At the start of the [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] followed his example in the work now known as the Coburg Fables.<ref>Jason D. Lane, review of ''Luther's Aesop'', [http://www.logia.org/logia-online/653 Logia, December 30, 2013]</ref> Another source of Christianized fables was in the [[emblem books]] of the 16th\u201317th centuries. In [[Georgette de Montenay]]'s ''Emblemes ou devises chrestiennes'' (1571), for example, the fable of [[The Oak and the Reed]] was depicted in the context of the lines from the [[Magnificat]], \"He hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree\" (Luke 1.52, AV).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FMOa058|title=French Emblems: Emblem: Deposuit Potent et Exaltavit|work=gla.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nOnce the fables were perceived as primarily for the instruction of children, a new generation of Christian writers began putting their own construction on them, often at odds with their original interpretation. An extreme example occurs in a compilation called ''Christian Fables'' from the Victorian era, where [[The North Wind and the Sun]] is referred to Biblical passages in which religion is compared to a cloak. Therefore, says the author, one should beware of abandoning one's beliefs under the sun of prosperity.<ref>Rev. Samuel Lysons, ''Christian Fables, or the fables of Aesop, and other writers, Christianized and adapted with Christian morals for the use of young people'', London 1850, [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AtcxAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA6, p.6]</ref> Demonstrably, the essence of fables is their adaptability. Beginning two and a half millennia ago with aetiological solutions to philosophical problems, fresh religious applications were continuing into the present.\n\n==Dramatised fables==\nThe success of La Fontaine's fables in France started a European fashion for creating plays around them. The originator was [[Edm\u00e9 Boursault]], with his five-act verse drama ''Les Fables d'Esope'' (1690), later retitled ''Esope \u00e0 la ville'' (Aesop in town). Such was its popularity that a rival theatre produced [[Eustache Le Noble]]'s ''Arlaquin-Esope'' in the following year. Boursault then wrote a sequel, ''Esope \u00e0 la cour'' (Aesop at court), a heroic comedy that was held up by the censors and not produced until after his death in 1701.<ref>Honor\u00e9 Champion, ''R\u00e9pertoire Chronologique des Spectacles \u00e0 Paris, 1680\u20131715'', (2002); [http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/spielmag/finderegne/repertoire2.htm#top georgetown.edu]</ref> Other 18th-century imitations included [[Jean-Antoine du Cerceau]]'s ''Esope au coll\u00e8ge'' (1715),<ref>[https://archive.org/details/oeuvresdeducerce01duceuoft/page/162 Archived online]</ref> where being put in charge of a school gives the fabulist ample opportunity to tell his stories, and [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Pesselier]]'s ''Esope au Parnasse'' (1739), a one-act piece in verse.<ref>[http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/programmes/edition.php?t=..%2Fdocuments%2FPESSELIER_ESOPEAUPARNASSE.xml Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Classique]</ref>\n\n''Esope \u00e0 la ville'' was written in [[French alexandrine]] [[couplet]]s and depicted a physically ugly Aesop acting as adviser to Learchus, governor of [[Cyzicus]] under [[King Croesus]], and using his fables as satirical comments on those seeking his favour or to solve romantic problems. One of the problems is personal to Aesop, since he is betrothed to the governor's daughter, who detests him and has a young admirer with whom she is in love. There is very little action, the play serving as a platform for the recitation of [[free verse]] fables at frequent intervals. These include [[The Fox and the Weasel]], [[The Fox and the Mask]], [[The Belly and the Other Members]], [[the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]], [[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|the Fox and the Crow]], [[The Snake and the Crab|the Crab and her Daughter]], [[The Frog and the Ox]], [[The Swan and the Goose|the Cook and the Swan]], [[The Wolf and the Lamb]], [[The Mountain in Labour]], and [[The Man with two Mistresses]].

Cartoonist [[Terrytoons|Paul Terry]] began his own series, called ''[[Aesop's Film Fables]]'', in 1921 but by the time this was taken over by [[Van Beuren Studios]] in 1928 the story lines had little connection with any fable of Aesop's. In the early 1960s, animator [[Jay Ward]] created a television series of short cartoons called ''[[Aesop and Son]]'' which were first aired as part of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''. Actual fables were spoofed to result in a pun based on the original moral. Two fables are also featured in the 1971 TV movie ''Aesop's Fables'' in the US. Here Aesop is a black story teller who relates two turtle fables, [[The Tortoise and the Birds|The Tortoise and the Eagle]] and [[the Tortoise and the Hare]] to a couple of children who wander into an enchanted grove.

Among these was Canadian writer [[Robertson Davies]]' ''A Masque of Aesop'' (1952), which was set at his trial in Delphi and allows the defendant to tell the fables ''[[The Belly and the Members]]'', ''[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]'' and ''[[The Cock and the Jewel]]'' while challenging prevailing social attitudes.<ref>Susan Stone-Blackburn, ''Robertson Davies, playwright'', University of British Columbia 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2wSfrq9cM_QC&lpg=PA93&dq=%22Aesop%20at%20%22&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q=Masque&f=false pp. 92\u201396]</ref>\n\n==Musical treatments==\nWhile musical settings of La Fontaine's Fables began appearing in France within a few decades of their publication, it was not until the 19th century that composers began to take their inspiration directly from Aesop.

His ''Der L\u00f6we und die Maus'' ([[The Lion and the Mouse]] 1931) was a [[singspiel]] drama for small orchestra and children's choir; aimed at 12- to 14-year-olds, it was built on an improvisation by the composer's own children.<ref>Joachim Draheim, [https://books.google.com/books?id=axS10XF46tsC&lpg=PA111&dq=%22the%20satyr%20and%20the%20traveller%22&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q=maus&f=false p.10]</ref> He followed this with ''Der Fuchs und der Rabe '' (The Fox and the Crow) in 1932. {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Poser|de|3=Hans Poser}}'s ''Die Fabeln des \u00c4sop'' (Op. 28, 1956) was set for accompanied men's chorus and uses [[Martin Luther]]'s translation of six.<ref>The piano score is available [http://www.notenpost.de/out/media/Musterseiten-eres_20371_Hans-Poser-Die-Fabeln-des-Aesop.pdf online]</ref> Others who have set German texts for choir include {{Interlanguage link multi|Herbert Callhoff|de|3=Herbert Callhoff}} (1963) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Andre Asriel|de|3=Andre Asriel}} (1972).\n\nThe commonest approach in building a musical bridge to children has involved using a narrator with musical backing. Following the example of Sergei Prokoviev in \"[[Peter and the Wolf]]\" (1936), [[Vincent Persichetti]] set six for narrator and orchestra in his ''Fables'' (Op. 23 1943).<ref>[https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/53180868 Archivegrid] fable list</ref>  Richard Maltz also composed his ''Aesop's Fables'' (1993) to introduce the instruments of the orchestra to elementary students and to teach them about the elements of music,<ref>[http://richardmaltz.com/Hare.html Composer\u2019s site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216103257/http://richardmaltz.com/Hare.html |date=16 February 2016 }} with recordings and fable list</ref> and [[Daniel Dorff]]'s widely performed ''3 Fun Fables'' (1996) has contrasting instruments interpreting characters: in \"[[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The Fox and the Crow]]\" it is trumpet and contrabass;  in \"[[The Dog and Its Reflection]]\" it is trombone and violin, harp and percussion; in \"[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]\" it is contrabassoon and clarinet.<ref>Excerpts on the [http://www.danieldorff.com/pn-3ff.htm composer\u2019s website]</ref> Others simply adapt the narrator's voice to a musical backing.

Instead of following the wording of one of the more standard fable collections, as other composers do, the performer speaks in character.

An updated version with greater range, the '''R-24''', replaced it in service. It is comparable to the American [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], both in terms of overall performance as well as role.\n\n==Development==\nDesign of a new missile to arm the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] fighter started in the mid-1960s under the direction of V.A. Pustyakov's design team. Known as the '''K-23''' during its design, the new weapon was intended for use against bomber-sized targets, with \"snap-up\" capability to attack targets at higher altitude than the launch aircraft. It originally was intended to have a dual-mode seeker using both [[semi-active radar homing]] and [[infrared]] guidance, but this proved unfeasible, and separate SARH and IR models (''Izdeliye'' (Product) 340 and 360, respectively) were developed instead. Test firings were carried out in [[1967 in aviation|1967]], although the SARH missile's seeker head proved to be extremely problematic.\n\nIn 1968 the Soviets acquired an AIM-7 and a Vympel team started copying it as the '''K-25'''. A comparison of the two led to the K-23 entering production, based largely on its better range and countermeasures resistance. The K-25 work ended in 1971. Nevertheless, several features of the Sparrow were later used in the [[Vympel R-27]] design.\n\nThe missile, designated '''R-23''', entered service in January [[1974 in aviation|1974]], the SARH version as the '''R-23R''', the IR version '''R-23T'''. Both versions used the same motor and warhead, which had a lethal radius of 8&nbsp;m (26&nbsp;ft). In the west these were known as the AA-7A and AA-7B, respectively. An inert training round, the '''R-23UT''', was also developed.\n\nThe airframe featured four [[delta wing]]s arranged cruciform just behind the midpoint of the fuselage, and cropped-delta control surfaces at the extreme rear in-line with the wings. Smaller cropped-triangular surfaces are mounted in-line near the nose : known as \"destabilizers\", they serve to improve the rudders' efficiency at high angles of attack (the R-60 missile uses the same feature). The only external difference between the two versions was the nose cone, which was an ogive for the SARH seeker, and shorter (by 30&nbsp;cm) and more rounded for the IR version.\n\nMaximum range for the R-23R is 35&nbsp;km, and for the infrared version R-23T is 15&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"R-23 range\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/aa-7.htm|title=AA-7 APEX R-23 / R-24|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of R-23s were built., both by Molniya (ex [[OKB-4]]) as well as Vympel (ex [[OKB-134]]).\n\nStarting in 1975 an improved version of the weapon was developed to arm the MiG-23ML/MLD. The resultant SARH '''R-24R''' had lock-on after launch capability and expanded range (up to 50&nbsp;km) and altitude capability (up to 25,000 m/82,000&nbsp;ft), while the IR '''R-24T''' had a much improved seeker with greater sensitivity. Both versions had a larger motor, a heavier warhead, and a greatly reduced minimum range of 500 m (1,600&nbsp;ft) for a rear-quarter engagement. They also could be used by or against aircraft maneuvering at up to 7''g''. The missiles were known officially as ''izdeliye'' (Product) 140 and 160 in the USSR, and AA-7C and AA-7D in the west. The R-23/24 was also produced under license in Romania as the '''A-911/A901'''.\n\nThe R-24 remained in at least limited Russian service until the withdrawal of the last Russian MiG-23s in [[1997 in aviation|1997]].\n\n==Combat record==\n===Syria===\nThe R-23 was used in the [[Beqaa Valley]] in June 1982, during the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. However, it is hard to judge its success. Soviet and Syrian sources claim that it achieved a few kills while the Israelis deny this. According to Austrian researcher Tom Cooper, Syrian claims include using the R-23/24 against six [[F-16]]As and one [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2]]C, however, the only confirmed kill is against a [[BQM-34]] drone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=47|title=Syrian Air-to-Air Victories since 1948 - www.acig.org|author=Sander Peeters|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Syrian civil war]] Syrian [[Mig-23]]s used R-24R misslies to shot down 2 Jordanian [[Selex ES Falco]] in the vincinity of [[Daraa]] province on 15-16 June 2017.<ref name=\"warisboring.com\">[https://www.warisboring.com/drones-are-dropping-like-flies-from-the-sky-over-syria/ Drones Are Dropping Like Flies From the Sky Over Syria Shoot-downs are becoming commonplace.

An updated version with greater range, the '''R-24''', replaced it in service. It is comparable to the American [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], both in terms of overall performance as well as role.\n\n==Development==\nDesign of a new missile to arm the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] fighter started in the mid-1960s under the direction of V.A. Pustyakov's design team. Known as the '''K-23''' during its design, the new weapon was intended for use against bomber-sized targets, with \"snap-up\" capability to attack targets at higher altitude than the launch aircraft. It originally was intended to have a dual-mode seeker using both [[semi-active radar homing]] and [[infrared]] guidance, but this proved unfeasible, and separate SARH and IR models (''Izdeliye'' (Product) 340 and 360, respectively) were developed instead. Test firings were carried out in [[1967 in aviation|1967]], although the SARH missile's seeker head proved to be extremely problematic.\n\nIn 1968 the Soviets acquired an AIM-7 and a Vympel team started copying it as the '''K-25'''. A comparison of the two led to the K-23 entering production, based largely on its better range and countermeasures resistance. The K-25 work ended in 1971. Nevertheless, several features of the Sparrow were later used in the [[Vympel R-27]] design.\n\nThe missile, designated '''R-23''', entered service in January [[1974 in aviation|1974]], the SARH version as the '''R-23R''', the IR version '''R-23T'''. Both versions used the same motor and warhead, which had a lethal radius of 8&nbsp;m (26&nbsp;ft). In the west these were known as the AA-7A and AA-7B, respectively. An inert training round, the '''R-23UT''', was also developed.\n\nThe airframe featured four [[delta wing]]s arranged cruciform just behind the midpoint of the fuselage, and cropped-delta control surfaces at the extreme rear in-line with the wings. Smaller cropped-triangular surfaces are mounted in-line near the nose : known as \"destabilizers\", they serve to improve the rudders' efficiency at high angles of attack (the R-60 missile uses the same feature). The only external difference between the two versions was the nose cone, which was an ogive for the SARH seeker, and shorter (by 30&nbsp;cm) and more rounded for the IR version.\n\nMaximum range for the R-23R is 35&nbsp;km, and for the infrared version R-23T is 15&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"R-23 range\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/aa-7.htm|title=AA-7 APEX R-23 / R-24|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of R-23s were built., both by Molniya (ex [[OKB-4]]) as well as Vympel (ex [[OKB-134]]).\n\nStarting in 1975 an improved version of the weapon was developed to arm the MiG-23ML/MLD. The resultant SARH '''R-24R''' had lock-on after launch capability and expanded range (up to 50&nbsp;km) and altitude capability (up to 25,000 m/82,000&nbsp;ft), while the IR '''R-24T''' had a much improved seeker with greater sensitivity. Both versions had a larger motor, a heavier warhead, and a greatly reduced minimum range of 500 m (1,600&nbsp;ft) for a rear-quarter engagement. They also could be used by or against aircraft maneuvering at up to 7''g''. The missiles were known officially as ''izdeliye'' (Product) 140 and 160 in the USSR, and AA-7C and AA-7D in the west. The R-23/24 was also produced under license in Romania as the '''A-911/A901'''.\n\nThe R-24 remained in at least limited Russian service until the withdrawal of the last Russian MiG-23s in [[1997 in aviation|1997]].\n\n==Combat record==\n===Syria===\nThe R-23 was used in the [[Beqaa Valley]] in June 1982, during the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. However, it is hard to judge its success. Soviet and Syrian sources claim that it achieved a few kills while the Israelis deny this. According to Austrian researcher Tom Cooper, Syrian claims include using the R-23/24 against six [[F-16]]As and one [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2]]C, however, the only confirmed kill is against a [[BQM-34]] drone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=47|title=Syrian Air-to-Air Victories since 1948 - www.acig.org|author=Sander Peeters|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Syrian Civil Syrian [[Mig-23]]s used R-24R misslies to shot down 2 Jordanian [[Selex ES Falco]] in the vincinity of [[Daraa]] province on 15-16 June 2017.<ref name=\"warisboring.com\">[https://www.warisboring.com/drones-are-dropping-like-flies-from-the-sky-over-syria/ Drones Are Dropping Like Flies From the Sky Over Syria Shoot-downs are becoming commonplace.

Originally published in three volumes between 1900 and 1903 with the cover title \"52 Choralvorspiele f\u00fcr Orgel\" (52 chorale preludes for organ), the full title of the collection was \"Zweiundf\u00fcnfzig leicht ausf\u00fchrbare Vorspiele zu den gebr\u00e4uchlichsten evangelischen Chor\u00e4len\".\n\n== Background ==\nIn a letter to the publishers Lauterbach & Kuhn in 1902 when he had only composed 50 of the [[chorale prelude]]s, Reger wrote, \"None are technically difficult and the melodies have been collected by an organist of 30 years experience. I can surely say without any arrogance that since J. S. Bach, no such collection has been published!\"{{sfn|Anderson|2013}} While he composed some settings in [[Weiden in der Oberpfalz|Weiden]] in 1900, he wrote the majority of the prelude in Munich between September 1901 and October 1902. Reger's full title for the collection, \"Zweiundf\u00fcnfzig leicht ausf\u00fchrbare Vorspiele zu den gebr\u00e4uchlichsten evangelischen Chor\u00e4len\",{{sfn|Institute|2017}} has been translated as \"Fifty-two easy preludes on the most common Lutheran chorales\". They were originally published in three volumes with the cover title \"52 Choralvorspiele f\u00fcr Orgel\" (52 chorale preludes for organ) between 1900 and 1903: Volume 1, Nos. 1\u201315; Volume 2, Nos. 16\u201336; Volume 3, Nos. 37\u201352.{{sfn|Carus|2014}}\n\nThe idea of writing such a collection dates back to 1893. Its size and form\u2014short pieces with four-part writing and almost no episodes\u2014has similarities with the 46 \"minuaturist\" chorale preludes of Bach's [[Orgelb\u00fcchlein]]. The wording of the title reflects Reger's concern that his shorter pieces should be accessible and without technical difficulties: his organ works had previously been criticized for being too difficult and complex. In a 1904 letter to his friend [[Karl Straube]], organist at the [[Thomaskirche]], advising him on which pieces to perform in a Leipzig recital, Reger indicated his own preferences, picking out ''O Welt ich mu\u00df dich lassen'' and ''Vater unser'' as amongst the most beautiful. There is a musical \"echo effect\" in each of these pieces, with the chorale played a second time only on the manuals with a subdued dynamic. The musicologist Christopher Anderson compares Reger's setting of \"O Welt\" with the last piece from [[Eleven Chorale Preludes]], Op. 122 of [[Johannes Brahms]], published posthumously in 1902, which uses a double echo effect and has a similar mood of \"melancholic leave-taking\". Reger's compositional style in the preludes, although intended to be simple from a technical point of view, was musically complex, occasionally mirroring musical features of chorale preludes in Bach's  collection: Reger's setting of \"Machs mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\" has several similarities with [[BWV 622| ''O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df'', BWV 622]]\u2014one of Reger's favourites\u2014with the same type of flattened sixth at the close.{{sfn|Anderson|2013}}\n\nReger's op. 67 represents his most significant contribution to the genre of chorale prelude. In 1916, the musicologist [[Harvey Grace]] described it in ''[[The Musical Times]]'' as showing Reger \"at his best\". In 1961 the American organist Allan Bacon commented on \"the enormous disparity between the various pieces from the standpoint of sheer technical difficulty,\" describing some as \"tenderly naive, flowly gently along\" while others were only playable by virtuoso organists like [[Karl Straube]], who championed Reger's works during his lifetime. In his 1939 biography of Reger, [[Fritz Stein]] wrote of the chorale preludes in Op. 67 and Op. 79b, \"In spite of their contrapuntal art and link with the motivic work of the old organ chorales, they represent no advancement on the depth of religious expression found in Bach's models. Many are merely workmanlike, but if a chorale rests on Reger's innermost religious convictions\u2014such as 'Auf tiefer Not', 'Herzlich tut mich verlangen' and 'O Welt ich muss dich lassen'\u2014then these preludes express pious emotion.\"{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n\nThe chorale preludes in Op. 67 can be divided into five types:{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n\n*''[[chorale harmonization|Harmonized chorale prelude]]''. These are the most accessible of the chorale preludes, of varying degrees of complexity. There are eight such preludes (Nos. 19, 20, 29, 33, 37, 45, 50 and 52). They are [[homophonic]], written for four or five voices, with the [[cantus firmus]]\u2014the chorale melody\u2014in the soprano, sometimes also shared with the pedal; in No. 52 the melody is wholly in the pedal part. The distinguishing feature of these preludes is that the accompaniment is not constructed from motives derived from the cantus firmus.\n\n*''Figural chorale prelude''. These form the bulk of the collection, all but thirteen of the preludes having this form. Of the figurative chorales, three are ornamental chorale preludes, a genre described in further detail below. The figural chorale preludes have an accompaniment built up from one or more figure or motif either directly derived from the cantus firmus\u2014often by [[diminution]]\u2014or newly composed. The cantus firmus either plays continuously throughout a prelude or can be broken up by short passages of the accompanying motifs. In general the figural chorale preludes show a number of common features: individual pieces have a rhythmic uniformity; the motifs derived from the chorale mostly are limited to introductory bars; the accompaniment is rarely formed from just one motif or rhythmic element; and there is an overall preference for free counterpoint rather than imitation.  Harvey Grace criticized Reger's tendency to introduce promising motifs, sometimes heard in imitation between the parts, only to abandon them once the cantus firmus entered.\n\n[[File:Reger Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct Op 67 No 25.ogg|thumb|350px|\"Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\", Op.67, No.25]]\n[[File:Max Reger Sauer-Orgel Op. 660 Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche Berlin.jpeg|thumb|upright|Reger playing the Sauer organ in the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche]], Berlin]]\n*''Ornamental chorale prelude.'' There are three such chorale preludes (Nos. 5, 13 and 25). Written in 4 parts for two manual keyboards and pedal, they are written in four parts with a highly elaborate version of the cantus firmus in the soprano voice. The elaboration can occasionally become so florid and complex that it is hard to recognize the original melody.\n\n*''Canonic chorale prelude.'' There is only one such prelude, No. 51, written in four parts with the cantus firmus in [[canon (music)|canon]] between the soprano part and the pedal.\n\n*''Hybrid chorale prelude.'' There are four such preludes (Nos. 38, 39, 43 and 49), which mix two of the above genres: in the first three some phrases are set according to the figural model, with a motivic accompaniment for the cantus firmus; the other \"echo\" responses take the simpler form of homophonic chorale harmonizations.\n\nIn 1913 Reger recorded organ rolls of Nos. 20, 23, 25, 33, 45, 50 and 52 on the mechanical Philharmonic Organ (''Philharmonie-Orgel'') of the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Company]].{{sfn|Anderson|2003}}{{sfn|Welte|2017}} Welte brought out this organ in 1911, displaying it that year at the [[Turin International|World Exhibition in Turin]]. Two years later they solicited recordings from well-known organists  on an improved model in their factory in [[Freiburg]].{{efn|Regarded at the time as instruments of prestige, Philharmonic Organs were built for worldwide distribution, including for [[Harrods]] in London and for the ocean liner [[HMHS Britannic]], sister ship of [[RMS Titanic]]; the onset of [[World War I]] prevented installation of the organ on the Britannic, which sunk in the [[Aegean Sea]] in 1916 while serving as a [[hospital ship]].{{sfn|Rumsey|2011}}}}\n\nThe tempos for many of the chorale preludes are slow, as illustrated in Reger's own recordings; when he indicated a slow tempo, he would frequently add parenthetically \"but not dragging\". As {{harvtxt|Anderson|2013}} explains, in pieces like \"Aus tiefer Not, schrei ich zu dir\" (No. 3), \"Jauchs, Erd, und Himmel, juble hell\" (No. 15) and \"Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\" (No. 25), a more moderate tempo enables the listener to take in the changing sonorities, subtle dissonances or brilliant semiquaver passage work on the organ. Although the latest German organs in Reger's day, built by [[Wilhelm Sauer|Sauer]] and [[Paul Walcker|Walcker]], had [[crescendo pedal|special devices]] to control the dynamics, there are now established ways\u2014which can involve using assistants to change [[organ stop]]s\u2014to produce similar effects on organs of different construction.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Billmeyer|2016}}</ref>\n\n== Chorale preludes ==\n[[File:Reger Op.67 No.45 Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten.ogg|right|thumb|\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\", Op.67, No.45|350px]]\n[[File:Reger Op.67 No.45 Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten.jpeg|thumb|200px|\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\", Op. 67, No. 45, an example of a harmonized chorale prelude]]\n\nThe 52 pieces are based on the following chorales which are mostly arranged alphabetically.{{sfn|Institute|2017}} The chorale preludes fall into five types: [[chorale harmonization|harmonized chorale]] (''H''); figural chorale prelude (''F'') with a motivic accompaniment often derived from the melody of the chorale; canonic chorale prelude (''C'') with the chorale in [[canon (music)|canon]] between two voices;  ornamental chorale prelude (''O'') with a highly elaborate version of the chorale in the highest voice; and hybrid  chorale prelude (''Hy''), a combination of the above. The list also specifies the number of voices in the piece and indicates which voices (''[[SATB]]'' and ''P'' for pedal) share the [[cantus firmus]] (c.f.).{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n{{div

Originally published in three volumes between 1900 and 1903 with the cover title \"52 Choralvorspiele f\u00fcr Orgel\" (52 chorale preludes for organ), the full title of the collection was \"Zweiundf\u00fcnfzig leicht ausf\u00fchrbare Vorspiele zu den gebr\u00e4uchlichsten evangelischen Chor\u00e4len\".\n\n== Background ==\nIn a letter to the publishers Lauterbach & Kuhn in 1902 when he had only composed 50 of the [[chorale prelude]]s, Reger wrote, \"None are technically difficult and the melodies have been collected by an organist of 30 years experience. I can surely say without any arrogance that since J. S. Bach, no such collection has been published!\"{{sfn|Anderson|2013}} While he composed some settings in [[Weiden in der Oberpfalz|Weiden]] in 1900, he wrote the majority of the prelude in Munich between September 1901 and October 1902. Reger's full title for the collection, \"Zweiundf\u00fcnfzig leicht ausf\u00fchrbare Vorspiele zu den gebr\u00e4uchlichsten evangelischen Chor\u00e4len\",{{sfn|Institute|2017}} has been translated as \"Fifty-two easy preludes on the most common Lutheran chorales\". They were originally published in three volumes with the cover title \"52 Choralvorspiele f\u00fcr Orgel\" (52 chorale preludes for organ) between 1900 and 1903: Volume 1, Nos. 1\u201315; Volume 2, Nos. 16\u201336; Volume 3, Nos. 37\u201352.{{sfn|Carus|2014}}\n\nThe idea of writing such a collection dates back to 1893. Its size and form\u2014short pieces with four-part writing and almost no episodes\u2014has similarities with the 46 \"minuaturist\" chorale preludes of Bach's [[Orgelb\u00fcchlein]]. The wording of the title reflects Reger's concern that his shorter pieces should be accessible and without technical difficulties: his organ works had previously been criticized for being too difficult and complex. In a 1904 letter to his friend [[Karl Straube]], organist at the [[Thomaskirche]], advising him on which pieces to perform in a Leipzig recital, Reger indicated his own preferences, picking out ''O Welt ich mu\u00df dich lassen'' and ''Vater unser'' as amongst the most beautiful. There is a musical \"echo effect\" in each of these pieces, with the chorale played a second time only on the manuals with a subdued dynamic. The musicologist Christopher Anderson compares Reger's setting of \"O Welt\" with the last piece from [[Eleven Chorale Preludes]], Op. 122 of [[Johannes Brahms]], published posthumously in 1902, which uses a double echo effect and has a similar mood of \"melancholic leave-taking\". Reger's compositional style in the preludes, although intended to be simple from a technical point of view, was musically complex, occasionally mirroring musical features of chorale preludes in Bach's  collection: Reger's setting of \"Machs mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\" has several similarities with [[BWV 622| ''O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df'', BWV 622]]\u2014one of Reger's favourites\u2014with the same type of flattened sixth at the close.{{sfn|Anderson|2013}}\n\nReger's op. 67 represents his most significant contribution to the genre of chorale prelude. In 1916, the musicologist [[Harvey Grace]] described it in ''[[The Musical Times]]'' as showing Reger \"at his best\". In 1961 the American organist Allan Bacon commented on \"the enormous disparity between the various pieces from the standpoint of sheer technical difficulty,\" describing some as \"tenderly naive, flowly gently along\" while others were only playable by virtuoso organists like [[Karl Straube]], who championed Reger's works during his lifetime. In his 1939 biography of Reger, [[Fritz Stein]] wrote of the chorale preludes in Op. 67 and Op. 79b, \"In spite of their contrapuntal art and link with the motivic work of the old organ chorales, they represent no advancement on the depth of religious expression found in Bach's models. Many are merely workmanlike, but if a chorale rests on Reger's innermost religious convictions\u2014such as 'Auf tiefer Not', 'Herzlich tut mich verlangen' and 'O Welt ich muss dich lassen'\u2014then these preludes express pious emotion.\"{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n\nThe chorale preludes in Op. 67 can be divided into five types:{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n\n*''[[chorale harmonization|Harmonized chorale prelude]]''. These are the most accessible of the chorale preludes, of varying degrees of complexity. There are eight such preludes (Nos. 19, 20, 29, 33, 37, 45, 50 and 52). They are [[homophonic]], written for four or five voices, with the [[cantus firmus]]\u2014the chorale melody\u2014in the soprano, sometimes also shared with the pedal; in No. 52 the melody is wholly in the pedal part. The distinguishing feature of these preludes is that the accompaniment is not constructed from motives derived from the cantus firmus.\n\n*''Figural chorale prelude''. These form the bulk of the collection, all but thirteen of the preludes having this form. Of the figurative chorales, three are ornamental chorale preludes, a genre described in further detail below. The figural chorale preludes have an accompaniment built up from one or more figure or motif either directly derived from the cantus firmus\u2014often by [[diminution]]\u2014or newly composed. The cantus firmus either plays continuously throughout a prelude or can be broken up by short passages of the accompanying motifs. In general the figural chorale preludes show a number of common features: individual pieces have a rhythmic uniformity; the motifs derived from the chorale mostly are limited to introductory bars; the accompaniment is rarely formed from just one motif or rhythmic element; and there is an overall preference for free counterpoint rather than imitation.  Harvey Grace criticized Reger's tendency to introduce promising motifs, sometimes heard in imitation between the parts, only to abandon them once the cantus firmus entered.\n\n[[File:Reger Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct Op 67 No 25.ogg|thumb|350px|\"Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\", Op.67, No.25]]\n[[File:Max Reger Sauer-Orgel Op. 660 Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche Berlin.jpeg|thumb|upright|Reger playing the Sauer organ in the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche]], Berlin]]\n*''Ornamental chorale prelude.'' There are three such chorale preludes (Nos. 5, 13 and 25). Written in 4 parts for two manual keyboards and pedal, they are written in four parts with a highly elaborate version of the cantus firmus in the soprano voice. The elaboration can occasionally become so florid and complex that it is hard to recognize the original melody.\n\n*''Canonic chorale prelude.'' There is only one such prelude, No. 51, written in four parts with the cantus firmus in [[canon (music)|canon]] between the soprano part and the pedal.\n\n*''Hybrid chorale prelude.'' There are four such preludes (Nos. 38, 39, 43 and 49), which mix two of the above genres: in the first three some phrases are set according to the figural model, with a motivic accompaniment for the cantus firmus; the other \"echo\" responses take the simpler form of homophonic chorale harmonizations.\n\nIn 1913 Reger recorded organ rolls of Nos. 20, 23, 25, 33, 45, 50 and 52 on the mechanical Philharmonic Organ (''Philharmonie-Orgel'') of the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Company]].{{sfn|Anderson|2003}}{{sfn|Welte|2017}} Welte brought out this organ in 1911, displaying it that year at the [[Turin International|World Exhibition in Turin]]. Two years later they solicited recordings from well-known organists  on an improved model in their factory in [[Freiburg]].{{efn|Regarded at the time as instruments of prestige, Philharmonic Organs were built for worldwide distribution, including for [[Harrods]] in London and for the ocean liner [[HMHS Britannic]], sister ship of [[RMS Titanic]]; the onset of [[World War I]] prevented installation of the organ on the Britannic, which sunk in the [[Aegean Sea]] in 1916 while serving as a [[hospital ship]].{{sfn|Rumsey|2011}}}}\n\nThe tempos for many of the chorale preludes are slow, as illustrated in Reger's own recordings; when he indicated a slow tempo, he would frequently add parenthetically \"but not dragging\". As {{harvtxt|Anderson|2013}} explains, in pieces like \"Aus tiefer Not, schrei ich zu dir\" (No. 3), \"Jauchs, Erd, und Himmel, juble hell\" (No. 15) and \"Mach's mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G\u00fct\" (No. 25), a more moderate tempo enables the listener to take in the changing sonorities, subtle dissonances or brilliant semiquaver passage work on the organ. Although the latest German organs in Reger's day, built by [[Wilhelm Sauer|Sauer]] and [[Paul Walcker|Walcker]], had [[crescendo pedal|special devices]] to control the dynamics, there are now established ways\u2014which can involve using assistants to change [[organ stop]]s\u2014to produce similar effects on organs of different construction.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Billmeyer|2016}}</ref>\n\n== Chorale preludes ==\n[[File:Reger Op.67 No.45 Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten.ogg|right|thumb|\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\", Op.67, No.45|350px]]\n[[File:Reger Op.67 No.45 Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten.jpeg|thumb|200px|\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\", Op. 67, No. 45, an example of a harmonized chorale prelude]]\n\nThe 52 pieces are based on the following chorales which are mostly arranged alphabetically.{{sfn|Institute|2017}} The chorale preludes fall into five types: [[chorale harmonization|harmonized chorale]] (''H''); figural chorale prelude (''F'') with a motivic accompaniment often derived from the melody of the chorale; canonic chorale prelude (''C'') with the chorale in [[canon (music)|canon]] between two voices;  ornamental chorale prelude (''O'') with a highly elaborate version of the chorale in the highest voice; and hybrid  chorale prelude (''Hy''), a combination of the above. The list also specifies the number of voices in the piece and indicates which voices (''[[SATB]]'' and ''P'' for pedal) share the [[cantus firmus]] (c.f.).{{sfn|Jordahl|1965}}\n{{div
