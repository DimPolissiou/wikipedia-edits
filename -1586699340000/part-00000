He became quite interested in caving at about 14, at 15 he read the National Geographic report about Bill Stone's expedition to Huautla cave (NG, September 1995) which was decisive for his later caving, and at 16 he joined the Boston Mountain Grotto in Fayetteville.

While there, he worked with Franci Gabrov\u0161ek,<ref name=\"TFURICMEPCS\"/> who had a similar academic background in that he was a physicist by training but was using physics to understand processes occurring in caves. Covington read the book \"Processes of Speleogenesis: A modeling approach\",<ref name=\"PSMA\"/> co-authored by Gabrov\u0161ek, and met Gabrov\u0161ek at the Karst Waters Institute \"Future directions in karst research\" conference in San Antonio, TX.

After initial exploration in Evklidova pi\u0161\u010dal the DZRJL began systematic exploration of the area for new caves. Many small caves were found. In the summer of 2013 Covington led an international expedition to the area in collaboration with DZRJL. During this time the team found another promising cave, Platonovo \u0161epetanje (pron. Plahtonovoh shepetanya, translated as Plato's whisper) cave. Later that fall, cavers from DZRJL found the next large cave, Trubarjev dah (pron. Troobaryev dah, translated as Trubar's breath).

He had only a 5 mm wetsuit and planned for a maximum dive duration of 20 minutes. After 30 m of horizontal continuation at a depth of approximately 10 meters, he saw an airbell above and ascended into it. There was no obvious continuation within the pocket above and at this point he decided to finish the dive and returned to Copacabana. Covington's dive computer read a water temperature of 0.5 degrees C. The main tunnel continued to descend, but Covington did not have the time to continue exploration there.<ref name=\"PVKSRBG\"/>\n\n== Other Pursuits ==\nCovington has also participated in cave exploration expeditions to Peru (2004),<ref name=\"CPA\"/> Sumatra (2000), the Purificacion area of Northern Mexico (2000, 2001),<ref name=\"J2_2009\"/> Grotte des Chamois in France (2011),<ref name=\"C2011\"/> Lukina jama in Croatia (2011),<ref name=\"DLJ\"/> to caves in Wulong County China (2012),<ref name=\"MMGC\"/> to glacier caves of Nepal and Svalbard.<ref name=\"GCENS\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"PESLGM\">{{cite thesis\n| type = PhD\n| first = Matthew D.\n| last = Covington\n| title = The production and evolution of scaling laws via galaxy merging\n| date = September 2008\n| publisher = University of California, Santa Cruz\n| URL = http://physics.ucsc.edu/~joel/Covington-PhD-thesis.pdf\n| accessdate = 14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ID\">{{cite journal\n| first = Burkhard\n| last = Bilger\n| title = In Deep / The dark and dangerous world of extreme cavers\n| date = 14 April 2014\n| journal = The New Yorker\n| URL = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/21/in-deep-2\n| accessdate = 17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RKJ\">{{cite web\n| first = Matic\n| last = Di Batista\n| title = Raziskovanje kra\u0161kih jam\n| trans-title = Karst Caves Exploration\n| language = Slovenian\n| date = 16 June 2014\n| publisher = gore-ljudje / mountains-people\n| URL = https://www.gore-ljudje.net/objava/107698/\n| accessdate = 18 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MDC\">{{cite web\n| first = Matt\n| last = Covington\n| title = Matthew D.

He had only a 5 mm wetsuit and planned for a maximum dive duration of 20 minutes. After 30 m of horizontal continuation at a depth of approximately 10 meters, he saw an airbell above and ascended into it. There was no obvious continuation within the pocket above and at this point he decided to finish the dive and returned to Copacabana. Covington's dive computer read a water temperature of 0.5 degrees C. The main tunnel continued to descend, but Covington did not have the time to continue exploration there.<ref name=\"PVKSRBG\"/>\n\n== Other Pursuits ==\nCovington has also participated in cave exploration expeditions to Peru (2004),<ref name=\"CPA\"/> Sumatra (2000), the Purificacion area of Northern Mexico (2000, 2001),<ref name=\"J2_2009\"/> Grotte des Chamois in France (2011),<ref name=\"C2011\"/> Lukina jama in Croatia (2011),<ref name=\"DLJ\"/> to caves in Wulong County China (2012),<ref name=\"MMGC\"/> to glacier caves of Nepal and Svalbard.<ref name=\"GCENS\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"PESLGM\">{{cite thesis\n| type = PhD\n| first = Matthew D.\n| last = Covington\n| title = The production and evolution of scaling laws via galaxy merging\n| date = September 2008\n| publisher = University of California, Santa Cruz\n| URL = http://physics.ucsc.edu/~joel/Covington-PhD-thesis.pdf\n| accessdate = 14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ID\">{{cite journal\n| first = Burkhard\n| last = Bilger\n| title = In Deep / The dark and dangerous world of extreme cavers\n| date = 14 April 2014\n| journal = The New Yorker\n| URL = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/21/in-deep-2\n| accessdate = 17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RKJ\">{{cite web\n| first = Matic\n| last = Di Batista\n| title = Raziskovanje kra\u0161kih jam\n| trans-title = Karst Caves Exploration\n| language = Slovenian\n| date = 16 June 2014\n| publisher = gore-ljudje / mountains-people\n| URL = https://www.gore-ljudje.net/objava/107698/\n| accessdate = 18 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MDC\">{{cite web\n| first = Matt\n| last = Covington\n| title = Matthew D.
