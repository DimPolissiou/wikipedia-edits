His father was formerly the ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|av beis din]]'' (head of the rabbinical court) of [[Khotymyr]].

As part of the dowry agreement, Rabbi Auerbach and his wife committed to supporting their son-in-law for the first three years of his marriage. On the first day, he came to eat breakfast and was served black bread, cream, a cup of coffee and [[halva]] by his mother-in-law. Schwadron ate the meal, thanked his mother-in-law, and went to learn. The next morning, he realized that his wife hadn't joined him and asked where she was. \"Oh, she had to go somewhere,\" Rebbetzin Auerbach replied. On the third morning, when his wife still didn't join him, Schwadron became worried and demanded to know what was going on. His mother-in-law tearfully admitted that they had agreed to support ''him'', but had no money to support ''her'' too. Schwadron's wife would come in after he left and make do with bread and water for breakfast.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 32&ndash;33.</ref>\n\nSchwadron founded his own home on simplicity and lack of luxury. He and his family lived in a small, two-room apartment in the [[Sha'arei Hesed]] neighborhood of Jerusalem, which lacked a refrigerator, a bathtub, a washing machine or running water. Water was drawn from a nearby well. The kitchen, located in the courtyard, was so small that it did not fulfill the [[halakha|halachic]] requirement for a [[mezuzah]].<ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 30&ndash;31.</ref> Yet despite the lack of space and conveniences, the family was known for sharing everything it had with drop-in visitors and indigent guests.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 63&ndash;66.</ref>\n\nSchwadron was the first son-in-law of Rabbi Auerbach.<ref name=\"laz387\"/> He was the brother-in-law of Rabbi [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat [[Kol Torah]] in [[Bayit Vegan]], with whom he enjoyed a long and productive relationship as learning partners and friends, and Rabbi [[Simcha Bunim Leizerson]], founding president of the [[Chinuch Atzmai]] school system.<ref name=\"donn\">Donn, Yochonon. \"The Maggid of Jerusalem: 10 Years Since His Passing\". ''[[Hamodia]]'', 13 December 2007, pp. C6-C7.</ref>\n\nFollowing his marriage, Schwadron joined the Ohel Torah [[kollel]], where he learned alongside future Torah leaders such as Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner]], Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], and Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv|Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]]. He also taught an evening [[Gemara]] class to residents of Shaarei Chesed, the neighborhood in which he now lived, and learned each night with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. In 1937, he was asked to deliver a more advanced evening Gemara [[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]] in Shaarei Chesed, a class he taught for the next 25 years.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 388&ndash;389.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, he became [[mashgiach ruchani]] at [[Yeshivat Tiferet Tzvi]] for young teens. The talks he gave to the students, as well as his personal example of total concentration in his own learning, made a lasting impression on these boys.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 390.</ref> Schwadron exerted a similar positive influence on [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] students at [[Mekor Chaim Yeshiva]], where he served as rosh yeshiva from 1950 to 1960. He taught the highest [[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]], establishing personal relationships with students that often lasted three or four decades.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 391.</ref>\n\nAt the urging of the [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]], Schwadron became a spokesman for the [[Lev L'Achim|Peylim]] organization, which promoted the spiritual rescue of Jewish children who had emigrated from [[Yemen]] and [[Morocco]] and were being housed in [[Ma'abarot|absorption camps]].<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 394.</ref>\n\n==Maggid of Jerusalem==\nIn 1952, Schwadron began giving a Friday-night lecture to the public at the [[Zikhron Moshe]] shtiebel near the [[Geula]] neighborhood of Jerusalem. It was this lecture, which continued for the next 40 years, that earned Schwadron the title of \"Maggid of Jerusalem.\"<ref name=\"laz395\">Lazewnik (2000), p. 395.</ref>\n\nHe opened each talk with [[halacha]] and ended with fiery [[musar movement|mussar]], penetrating his listeners' hearts and inspiring them to self-improvement.<ref name=\"laz395\"/> A master at storytelling, Schwadron was able to draw out his audience's emotions using sing-song, witty remarks, and exaggerated mannerisms before delivering the \"punch line\" of his call to change. Often he punctuated the irony of human foibles with a booming laugh and the words, \"''Pilei ployim, hafla vafelle''! (Wonder of wonders! Amazing!)\"<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nFollowing is the description of one speech delivered in the Hebrew month of [[Elul]], as Schwadron prepared his listeners to undertake serious contemplation and ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuvah]]'' before [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Yom Kippur]]:\n\n<blockquote>\"Imagine that the inhabitants of the local cemetery were given the opportunity by the Heavenly Court to return to this world for just one hour. Just one hour, just one hour,\" he sang in a mournful tone of voice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Look at the door!\" he startled the audience. \"There is the ''elte bubbe'' (great- grandmother) and the old rabbi who passed away last year! And there is Berel and Yankel and Yossel! They're all coming in!\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The listeners spun around, actually expecting to see the long departed members of their community walk through the ornate doorway. The vivid descriptions portrayed by the orator transported the crowded shul members into a dizzying whirl as they pictured the town filled up by the departed.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Move over,\" continued the speaker relentlessly. \"'Make place for me,' the former departed are screaming. 'We have just one hour!' Just one hour, just one hour,\" he intoned in that special tone unique to maggids.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The mournful tones and mannerisms employed by the maggid played on the listeners' emotions, putting his audience exactly where he wanted it to be: with thoughts of God's greatness, man's mortality, and the ''teshuvah'' period.<ref name=\"donn\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the course of his talks, Schwadron publicized many stories about leading rabbis and [[tzadik]]im of previous generations.<ref name=\"donn\"/> Some of these stories were included in Rabbi Paysach Krohn's books, ''The Maggid Speaks'' (on which Schwadron collaborated) and ''Echoes of the Maggid'' (published after Schwadron's death).\n\nJust as he exhorted others to change and improve, Schwadron constantly worked on improving himself. From the time of his marriage until into his eighties, he made a ''ta\u2019anit dibbur'' ({{Hebrew|\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8}}, abstention from speaking) every Monday and Thursday, as well as during the 40-day period from the first day of the month of [[Elul]] until [[Yom Kippur]].<ref name=\"donn\"/><ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 388.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with the Krohns==\nSchwadron traveled abroad frequently to raise money for the institutions with which he was involved. During his months-long stays, he would address congregations, conventions, and other assemblies, solidifying his title of \"Maggid\".<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nIt was on one of these trips, in late 1964, that he was invited by Rabbi Avrohom Zelig Krohn, father of Rabbi [[Paysach Krohn]], to stay at his home in New York, even though Schwadron didn't know him or his family personally. Schwadron insisted on paying rent, which Krohn agreed to reluctantly. During the five months that Schwadron resided with the Krohns, a close bond formed between him and the family. When Schwadron announced that he was leaving after [[Passover]] 1965 to travel back to Israel by boat, the entire family saw him off at the pier. Then Krohn handed Schwadron an envelope containing all the \"rent money\" he had paid, as he had never intended to keep it.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 26&ndash;29.</ref>\n\nA few days later, Krohn said he missed his guest so much that he decided to greet him when his boat docked in Israel. He and his wife quickly arranged passports and flew to Israel two days before Schwadron arrived. After giving the Schwadron family their own time for a reunion, the Krohns appeared with their own welcome.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref>\n\nKrohn was diagnosed with a terminal illness after this event, and died a year later. Six months after that, the family received a letter from Schwadron saying that he was coming to America again. Schwadron became a surrogate father to Krohn's seven orphans.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 30&ndash;31.</ref> He showed great sensitivity towards Krohn\u2019s widow, remembering his own mother\u2019s struggles to raise her orphaned children.<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nWith Schwadron's encouragement and active input, Rabbi Paysach Krohn penned the first of his popular ''\"Maggid\"'' books, ''The Maggid Speaks'', published in 1987.<ref>Krohn (1987), p. 14.</ref> Subsequent titles (''Along the Maggid's Journey'', ''In the Footsteps of the Maggid'') memorialized Schwadron's influence on the overall project. After Schwadron died, Krohn's titles reflected that fact, too (''Echoes of the Maggid'', ''Reflections of the Maggid'').\n\n==Personal vignettes==\nR. Shalom was known for his personal piety. During the entire month of Elul, R. Shalom would undertake a ''Taanis Dibur '', refraining from talking except for Divray Torah and mussar.\n\n==Published works==\nSchwadron wrote, annotated and edited more than 25 [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefarim]], mainly those penned by his grandfather, the ''Maharsham''.<ref name=\"intro\"/> These include:\n*''She'eilot U'teshuvot Maharsham''\n*''Oholei Shem''\n*''Daas Torah Maharsham''\n\nHe also edited and published two famous mussar texts composed by his teachers &mdash; ''Ohr Yahel'' by Rabbi Leib Chasman and ''Lev Eliyahu'' by Rabbi [[Elyah Lopian]].<ref name=\"intro\"/><ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 225&ndash;226.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nSchwadron's mother, Freida, died in 1962. His wife, Leah, died in 1977.<ref name=\"intro\"/>\n\nSchwadron died on December 21, 1997 (22 [[Kislev]] 5758).<ref name=\"donn\"/> He was buried in the Jewish cemetery on the [[Mount of Olives]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://harhazeisim.org/notables|title=Notables Interred on Har HaZeitim |publisher=Har Hazeisim Preservation |year=2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Krohn |first=Rabbi Paysach J. |title=The Maggid Speaks: Favorite stories and parables of Rabbi Sholom Schwardron shlita, Maggid of Jerusalem |publisher=[[ArtScroll|Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]] |year=1987 |isbn=0-89906-230-X}}\n*{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpuOAAAAMAAJ&q=voice+of+truth&dq=voice+of+truth&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hcEFUOCAC4em0AXq7ZDOBw&redir_esc=y |title=Voice of Truth: The life and eloquence of Rabbi Sholom Schwadron, the unforgettable Maggid of Jerusalem |last=Lazewnik |first=Libby |year=2000 |location=Brooklyn, N.Y. |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd. |isbn=9781578195008}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.artscroll.com/Chapters/voih-009.html ''Voice of Truth'', Chapter 9]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070710164453/http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=392 Excerpt from ''Around the Maggid's Table'' by Rabbi Paysach Krohn]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schwadron, Sholom}}\n[[Category:Haredi rabbis in Israel]]\n[[Category:20th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Hazzans]]\n[[Category:People from Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Rabbis in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Rabbis in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:Kohanim writers of Rabbinic literature]]\n[[Category:Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives]]\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Israeli singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Jewish leader\n| honorific-prefix = Rabbi\n| name             = Sholom Schwadron\n| honorific-suffix = \n| title            = Maggid of Jerusalem\n| image            = Sholom Schwadron.jpg\n| caption          = \n| synagogue        = \n| synagogueposition = \n| yeshiva          = \n| yeshivaposition  = \n| organisation     = \n| organisationposition = \n| began            = \n| ended            = \n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| rabbi            = \n| rebbe            = \n| kohan            = \n| hazzan           = \n| rank             = \n| other_post       = [[Mashgiach ruchani]], [[Yeshivat Tiferet Tzvi]]<br /> [[Rosh yeshiva]], [[Mekor Chaim Yeshiva]]\n<!---------- Personal details ---------->\n| birth_name       = Sholom Mordechai Schwadron\n| birth_date       = 1912\n| birth_place      = [[Jerusalem]]\n| death_date       = 21 December 1997\n| death_place      = Jerusalem\n| buried           = [[Mount of Olives]]\n| nationality      = [[Israel]]i\n| denomination     = [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]\n| residence        = \n| dynasty          = \n| parents          = Rabbi Yitzchak and Freida Schwadron\n| spouse           = Leah Auerbach\n| children         = \n| occupation       = \n| profession       = \n| alma_mater       = [[Hebron Yeshiva|Hebron yeshiva]]\n| semicha          = \n| signature        = \n}}\n'''Sholom Mordechai Hakohen Schwadron'''  ({{lang-he-n|\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05e9\u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05df}}{{lrm}}) (1912&ndash;21 December 1997) was a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[rabbi]] and orator.

''[[Hamodia]]'', 13 December 2007, pp. C6-C7.</ref>\n\nFollowing his marriage, Schwadron joined the Ohel Torah [[kollel]], where he learned alongside future Torah leaders such as Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner]], Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], and Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv|Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]]. He also taught an evening [[Gemara]] class to residents of Shaarei Chesed, the neighborhood in which he now lived, and learned each night with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. In 1937, he was asked to deliver a more advanced evening Gemara [[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]] in Shaarei Chesed, a class he taught for the next 25 years.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 388&ndash;389.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, he became [[mashgiach ruchani]] at [[Yeshivat Tiferet Tzvi]] for young teens. The talks he gave to the students, as well as his personal example of total concentration in his own learning, made a lasting impression on these boys.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 390.</ref> Schwadron exerted a similar positive influence on [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] students at [[Mekor Chaim Yeshiva]], where he served as rosh yeshiva from 1950 to 1960. He taught the highest [[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]], establishing personal relationships with students that often lasted three or four decades.<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 391.</ref>\n\nAt the urging of the [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]], Schwadron became a spokesman for the [[Lev L'Achim|Peylim]] organization, which promoted the spiritual rescue of Jewish children who had emigrated from [[Yemen]] and [[Morocco]] and were being housed in [[Ma'abarot|absorption camps]].<ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 394.</ref>\n\n==Maggid of Jerusalem==\nIn 1952, Schwadron began giving a Friday-night lecture to the public at the [[Zikhron Moshe]] shtiebel near the [[Geula]] neighborhood of Jerusalem. It was this lecture, which continued for the next 40 years, that earned Schwadron the title of \"Maggid of Jerusalem.\"<ref name=\"laz395\">Lazewnik (2000), p. 395.</ref>\n\nHe opened each talk with [[halacha]] and ended with fiery [[musar movement|mussar]], penetrating his listeners' hearts and inspiring them to self-improvement.<ref name=\"laz395\"/> A master at storytelling, Schwadron was able to draw out his audience's emotions using sing-song, witty remarks, and exaggerated mannerisms before delivering the \"punch line\" of his call to change. Often he punctuated the irony of human foibles with a booming laugh and the words, \"''Pilei ployim, hafla vafelle''! (Wonder of wonders! Amazing!)\"<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nFollowing is the description of one speech delivered in the Hebrew month of [[Elul]], as Schwadron prepared his listeners to undertake serious contemplation and ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuvah]]'' before [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Yom Kippur]]:\n\n<blockquote>\"Imagine that the inhabitants of the local cemetery were given the opportunity by the Heavenly Court to return to this world for just one hour. Just one hour, just one hour,\" he sang in a mournful tone of voice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Look at the door!\" he startled the audience. \"There is the ''elte bubbe'' (great- grandmother) and the old rabbi who passed away last year! And there is Berel and Yankel and Yossel! They're all coming in!\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The listeners spun around, actually expecting to see the long departed members of their community walk through the ornate doorway. The vivid descriptions portrayed by the orator transported the crowded shul members into a dizzying whirl as they pictured the town filled up by the departed.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Move over,\" continued the speaker relentlessly. \"'Make place for me,' the former departed are screaming. 'We have just one hour!' Just one hour, just one hour,\" he intoned in that special tone unique to maggids.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The mournful tones and mannerisms employed by the maggid played on the listeners' emotions, putting his audience exactly where he wanted it to be: with thoughts of God's greatness, man's mortality, and the ''teshuvah'' period.<ref name=\"donn\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the course of his talks, Schwadron publicized many stories about leading rabbis and [[tzadik]]im of previous generations.<ref name=\"donn\"/> Some of these stories were included in Rabbi Paysach Krohn's books, ''The Maggid Speaks'' (on which Schwadron collaborated) and ''Echoes of the Maggid'' (published after Schwadron's death).\n\nJust as he exhorted others to change and improve, Schwadron constantly worked on improving himself. From the time of his marriage until into his eighties, he made a ''ta\u2019anit dibbur'' ({{Hebrew|\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8}}, abstention from speaking) every Monday and Thursday, as well as during the 40-day period from the first day of the month of [[Elul]] until [[Yom Kippur]].<ref name=\"donn\"/><ref>Lazewnik (2000), p. 388.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with the Krohns==\nSchwadron traveled abroad frequently to raise money for the institutions with which he was involved. During his months-long stays, he would address congregations, conventions, and other assemblies, solidifying his title of \"Maggid\".<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nIt was on one of these trips, in late 1964, that he was invited by Rabbi Avrohom Zelig Krohn, father of Rabbi [[Paysach Krohn]], to stay at his home in New York, even though Schwadron didn't know him or his family personally. Schwadron insisted on paying rent, which Krohn agreed to reluctantly. During the five months that Schwadron resided with the Krohns, a close bond formed between him and the family. When Schwadron announced that he was leaving after [[Passover]] 1965 to travel back to Israel by boat, the entire family saw him off at the pier. Then Krohn handed Schwadron an envelope containing all the \"rent money\" he had paid, as he had never intended to keep it.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 26&ndash;29.</ref>\n\nA few days later, Krohn said he missed his guest so much that he decided to greet him when his boat docked in Israel. He and his wife quickly arranged passports and flew to Israel two days before Schwadron arrived. After giving the Schwadron family their own time for a reunion, the Krohns appeared with their own welcome.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref>\n\nKrohn was diagnosed with a terminal illness after this event, and died a year later. Six months after that, the family received a letter from Schwadron saying that he was coming to America again. Schwadron became a surrogate father to Krohn's seven orphans.<ref>Krohn (1987), pp. 30&ndash;31.</ref> He showed great sensitivity towards Krohn\u2019s widow, remembering his own mother\u2019s struggles to raise her orphaned children.<ref name=\"donn\"/>\n\nWith Schwadron's encouragement and active input, Rabbi Paysach Krohn penned the first of his popular ''\"Maggid\"'' books, ''The Maggid Speaks'', published in 1987.<ref>Krohn (1987), p. 14.</ref> Subsequent titles (''Along the Maggid's Journey'', ''In the Footsteps of the Maggid'') memorialized Schwadron's influence on the overall project. After Schwadron died, Krohn's titles reflected that fact, too (''Echoes of the Maggid'', ''Reflections of the Maggid'').\n\n==Personal vignettes==\nR. Shalom was known for his personal piety. During the entire month of Elul, R. Shalom would undertake a ''Taanis Dibur '', refraining from talking except for Divray Torah and mussar.\n\n==Published works==\nSchwadron wrote, annotated and edited more than 25 [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefarim]], mainly those penned by his grandfather, the ''Maharsham''.<ref name=\"intro\"/> These include:\n*''She'eilot U'teshuvot Maharsham''\n*''Oholei Shem''\n*''Daas Torah Maharsham''\n\nHe also edited and published two famous mussar texts composed by his teachers &mdash; ''Ohr Yahel'' by Rabbi Leib Chasman and ''Lev Eliyahu'' by Rabbi [[Elyah Lopian]].<ref name=\"intro\"/><ref>Lazewnik (2000), pp. 225&ndash;226.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nSchwadron's mother, Freida, died in 1962.

Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1987 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/uganda/ Uganda: A Country Study]. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990. p. 4</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, by the first century CE and possibly as early as the fourth century BCE in Western Tanzania, certain related Bantu-speaking metallurgists were perfecting iron smelting to produce medium grade [[carbon steel]] in pre-heated forced-draught furnaces. Although most of these developments were taking place southwest of modern Ugandan boundaries, iron was mined and smelted in many parts of the country not long afterward.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\"/>\n\n== Uganda Protectorate (1894\u20131962) ==  \n{{Further|Uganda Protectorate}}\n\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|recruited to East Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to construct the [[Uganda Railway]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/762515.stm | title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display | publisher=[[BBC]] | last=Evans | first=Ruth | date=24 May 2000 | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | title=THE LUNATIC EXPRESS \u2013 A PHOTO ESSAY ON THE UGANDA RAILWAY. | publisher=[[Thee Agora]] | last=Chao | date=26 October 2014 | access-date=18 January 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422095958/http://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | archive-date=22 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230140/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 September 2015 | title=Policing, Colonial Life and Decolonisation in Uganda, 1957\u20131960 | publisher=The Ferguson Centre for African and Asian Studies, Working Paper No. 03 | last=West | first=Stewart | date=February 2012 | pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/4/pdfs/02-0626.pdf | title=Reanalyzing the 1900\u20131920 Sleeping Sickness Epidemic in Uganda | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | location=US | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | last1=F\u00e8vre | first1=E.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule.

Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system.

Evidence from the Paleolithic era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1987 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule.

Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa.

In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city.

The protests were in retaliation to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.\n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or 'tanker mafia'. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of [[Bhopal]], where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=21 June 2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out. Eventually, local wild animals like elephants, tigers, and spotted deers started to sneak into the cities in search of water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Wild-animals-hit-by-water-scarcity/article16906373.ece|title=Wild animals hit by water scarcity|date=19 December 2016|work=The Hindu|access-date=3 April 2020|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>Some of these animals pose a threat to the citizens, as they can attack people.

Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=21 June 2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><br />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]]<nowiki/>is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=18 September 2019|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" /> The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=27 June 2019|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted.

The traditional techniques of irrigation are also to blame for the water crisis as they result in a majority of water loss and evaporation during the irrigation process.\n\n==== Wastage of water ====\nAccording to the Central Water Commission, even though climate change has resulted in a reduction in rainfall and thereby the water supply, the country still receives enough rainfall to meet the needs of over 1 billion people. However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/why-india-does-not-have-enough-water-to-drink-1557669-2019-06-28|title=Why India does not have enough water to drink|last=DelhiJune 28|first=Prabhash K.

In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes.\n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nA lot of non-governmental organisations in India are involved in establishing water harvesting structures in rural areas. For example, villagers in Palve Budruk, near [[Ahmednagar]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF.]] The system consists of 3 dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which families are expected to fill up water for drinking and cooking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of [[Rajasthan]].

The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts.\n\n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\n[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the name given to the innovative way of collecting rainwater in order to recharge the underground water. A lot of houses have built their own rainwater harvesting structures in order to be self sufficient. In [[Bangalore|Banglore]], Biome Environmental Trust and Friends of Lakes launched citizen initiatives to dig upto 1 million recharging wells and connect them to the groundwater using funnels. The nonprofit organisations expect this initiative to collect as much as 60% of the total rain water. <ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/07/india-water-crisis-drought-could-be-helped-better-building-planning/|title=India\u2019s water crisis could be helped by better building, planning|date=15 July 2019|website=Environment|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Desalination ====\n[[Desalination]] is a potential advanced technique to solve the problem of water shortage, especially in coastal regions. Desalination involves treating sea water to remove its salt content, making it fit for drinking. In the past decades, [[Israel]] has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water into fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. India is already looking into installing desalination plants near the coastal regions to fulfil the water needs cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|last=Akhil Ramesh|first=Shenhav Ruttner|date=31 October 2019|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Techniques ====\nEmploying almost 44% of India's working population, agriculture is one of the most important occupations in India.

The technology has the advantage of being applicable to all kinds of terrains in the country. Furthermore, the technique helps farmers  use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil. With the help of the Indian government, drip irrigation has seen a massive rise in implementation over the last 15 years. Currently, almost 3,51,000 hectares of irrigated land is under drip irrigation, compared to just 40 hectares in 1960s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n=== 2019 Chennai Water Crisis ===\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry.

The crisis has especially worsened in the recent years due to [[climate change]] which results in delayed monsoons consequently drying out reservoirs in several regions. Other factors attributed to the shortage of water in India are a lack of proper [[infrastructure]], government oversight and [[water pollution]].\n\nThe acute shortage of water for daily needs has prompted many government and non government organisations to take stringent measures to combat the problem. The [[Government of India]] has launched multiple schemes and programs, including the formation of an entire \u2018Jal Shakti\u2019 Ministry to deal with the ongoing problem. The government has also insisted on techniques such as [[rainwater harvesting]], water conservation and more efficient [[irrigation]]. [[Agriculture]] alone is responsible for 80% of the country\u2019s water usage.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nSeveral large cities of India have experienced water shortages in recent years, with [[Chennai]] being the most prominent in 2019. The shortage of water affected the entire city of 9 million people and resulted in the closure of several hotels, restaurants and businesses. According to a report by the [[NITI Aayog|National Institution for Transforming India]](NITI Aayog), at least 21 major Indian cities, including the capital [[New Delhi]] will completely run out of groundwater by 2020. The report also noted that approximately 200,000 people die in India each year due to the lack of access to safe drinking water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/indias-water-crisis-bengaluru-delhi-chennai-hyderabad-among-21-cities-to-run-out-of-groundwater-by-2020-4590221.html|title=Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai among 21 cities to run out of groundwater by 2020- Technology News, Firstpost|date=2018-06-25|website=Tech2|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n\n=== People ===\nThe scarcity of water in India affects hundreds of millions of people across the country.

A lot of Indians are forced with the option of spending money to buy drinking water but the poor sections of the society are unable to afford it on a daily basis which creates a massive problem of water scarcity for the rural population of India. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/major-indian-city-runs-out-water-million-people-pray-rain/|title=As a major Indian city runs out of water, 9 million people pray for rain|last=Masih|first=Niha|last2=AsiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow|first2=closeNiha MasihForeign correspondent covering IndiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowJoanna Slater closeJoanna SlaterForeign correspondent covering South|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nLimited accessibility to water is a threat to the people\u2019s health. Insufficient water has the capacity to deteriorate the health of an entire city in times of a water crisis. In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city. In June 2019 in Chennai, a woman was stabbed by her neighbor as she attempted to dig a borewell for water. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn February 2016, [[New Delhi]] was led to the brink of a severe water crisis by some [[Jat people|Jat tribe]] demonstrators who purposefully damaged the [[Munak canal]], a crucial source of water supply for the city. The protests were in retaliation to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.\n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or 'tanker mafia'. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of [[Bhopal]], where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=06/21/2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out. Eventually, local wild animals like elephants, tigers, and spotted deers started to sneak into the cities in search of water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Wild-animals-hit-by-water-scarcity/article16906373.ece|title=Wild animals hit by water scarcity|date=2016-12-19|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-04-03|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>Some of these animals pose a threat to the citizens, as they can attack people. Some animals like spotted deers get physically attacked by dogs in the process, or they wind up injured or dead in accidents. In the [[Madurai]] district, the acute water shortage caused Indian gaurs to die by falling into wells as they looked for water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Water-scarcity-leading-Indian-gaurs-to-death-traps/articleshow/20980502.cms|title=Water scarcity leading Indian gaurs to death traps {{!}} Madurai News - Times of India|last=Jul 9|first=J.

Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=06/21/2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><br />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]]<nowiki/>is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=2019-09-18|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" /> The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=2019-06-27|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted. Although one of the most important river in India, [[Ganges|Ganga]] is also the one that is most severely polluted. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Ganga-a-deadly-source-of-cancer-now-Study/articleshow/16858510.cms|title=NCRP: Ganga a deadly source of cancer now: Study {{!}} Patna News - Times of India|last=Oct 18|first=Anirban Ghosh {{!}} TNN {{!}} Updated:|last2=2012|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03|last3=Ist|first3=04:26}}</ref> The pollution mostly results from untreated sewage from densely populated cities, industrial waste as well as due to religious ceremonies in and around the river.

However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/why-india-does-not-have-enough-water-to-drink-1557669-2019-06-28|title=Why India does not have enough water to drink|last=DelhiJune 28|first=Prabhash K.

International organisations such as 'We are Water' and [[UNICEF]] are also very active in alleviating the problems of basic water supply and sanitation in villages. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182910/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BMIntro-1011.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2015-03-17|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=2016-03-22|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nMost of the non-governmental organizations work on raising social awareness and\u00a0 establishing water resources projects for the heavily affected parts of the country. \n\n==== Raising Social Awareness ====\nMost non-governmental organizations consider raising social awareness as one of their main responsibilities. They are actively involved in teaching the locals how to preserve the water resources and how to increase the water usage efficiency by installing new water gathering stations and improving their irrigation techniques. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=2016-03-22|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearewater.org/en-IN/our-foundation_253356|title=Our foundation|website=We Are Water|language=en-IN|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n\u2018We are Water\u2019 publishes documentary films every year broadcasting the severe water scarcity in India to raise social awareness. In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes.\n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nA lot of non-governmental organisations in India are involved in establishing water harvesting structures in rural areas. For example, villagers in Palve Budruk, near [[Ahmednagar]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF.]] The system consists of 3 dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which families are expected to fill up water for drinking and cooking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of [[Rajasthan]]. The foundation has covered over 550 villages and revived more than 2000 water harvesting structures in the region <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=http://jalbhagirathi.org/index.php|title=Home|date=2020-04-04|website=JBF|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. The organisation claims to harvest over 4000 million litres of water every year along with reclamation of 100+ hectares of barren land. <ref name=\":11\" />The organisation also works actively with schools in the region, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to them. The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts.\n\n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\n[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the name given to the innovative way of collecting rainwater in order to recharge the underground water. A lot of houses have built their own rainwater harvesting structures in order to be self sufficient. In [[Bangalore|Banglore]], Biome Environmental Trust and Friends of Lakes launched citizen initiatives to dig upto 1 million recharging wells and connect them to the groundwater using funnels. The nonprofit organisations expect this initiative to collect as much as 60% of the total rain water. <ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/07/india-water-crisis-drought-could-be-helped-better-building-planning/|title=India\u2019s water crisis could be helped by better building, planning|date=2019-07-15|website=Environment|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Desalination ====\n[[Desalination]] is a potential advanced technique to solve the problem of water shortage, especially in coastal regions. Desalination involves treating sea water to remove its salt content, making it fit for drinking. In the past decades, [[Israel]] has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water into fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. India is already looking into installing desalination plants near the coastal regions to fulfil the water needs cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|last=Akhil Ramesh|first=Shenhav Ruttner|date=2019-10-31|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Techniques ====\nEmploying almost 44% of India's working population, agriculture is one of the most important occupations in India. Consequently, upto 80% of the groundwater in India is used for [[irrigation]]. <ref name=\":82\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/23/india-the-national-ganga-river-basin-project|title=The National Ganga River Basin Project|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The Indian Agriculture Institute has been promoting the [[drip irrigation]] technology to relieve the water scarcity in India for decades. The technology has the advantage of being applicable to all kinds of terrains in the country. Furthermore, the technique helps farmers  use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil. With the help of the Indian government, drip irrigation has seen a massive rise in implementation over the last 15 years. Currently, almost 3,51,000 hectares of irrigated land is under drip irrigation, compared to just 40 hectares in 1960s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n=== 2019 Chennai Water Crisis ===\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry. Chennai is India\u2019s 6th largest metropolis with a population of roughly 9 million people. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/08/01/india-chennai-water-shortage-crisis-infrastructure|title=Nearly 11 Million People In The Indian City Of Chennai Are Almost Out Of Water|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The dire shortage of water affected the huge population of Chennai very badly as hundreds of people waited in lines with empty water buckets for hours. Several restaurants and hotels in the city also shut down due to the shortage of water. Even the IT firms in the city otherwise known for its thriving IT and automobile sectors were forced to ask their employees to work from home as the crisis worsened. Out of the daily requirement of 830 million litres of water a day (MLD), the city was only able to provide 525 MLD. <ref>{{Cite news|last=S|first=Mohamed Imranullah|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-supply-in-city-cut-to-525-from-830-mld-hc-told/article28023481.ece|title=Water supply in city cut to 525 MLD from 830 MLD, HC told|date=2019-06-18|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-04-03|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> [[Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewage Board|Chennai Metro Water]] was forced to cut short its daily water supply by 40% to deal with the ongoing crisis. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/chennais-piped-water-supply-cut-by-40-per-cent-amid-water-crisis-2044502|title=Chennai's Piped Water Supply Cut By 40 Per Cent Amid Severe Water Crisis|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The government responded by sending water tankers to residential areas.

He subsequently traveled to the United States to earn a master's degree in [[food science]] and international [[nutrition]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1978. After a brief stint in government working in Colombia's Department of National Planning, in [[Bogota]], from 1981 to 1982,<ref name=person>{{cite web|title=People: Arturo Escobar|url=http://anthropology.unc.edu/person/arturo-escobar/|website=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Anthropology|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> in 1987 he received an interdisciplinary Ph.D from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in Development Philosophy, Policy and Planning.<ref name=person/>\n\nHe has taught mainly at [[U.S. universities]], including the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], but also abroad at institutions in Colombia, [[Finland]], [[Spain]], and England. He is currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he teaches courses in development theory and social change, often co-teaching with long-time mentee Dr. Michal Osterweil of UNC's Department of Global Studies.\n\n==Scholarship==\n\n=== Anthropological approach ===\nEscobar's approach to anthropology is largely informed by the [[poststructuralist]] and [[postcolonialist]] traditions and centered around two recent developments: [[subaltern studies]] and the idea of a [[World Anthropologies Network]] (WAN).  His research interests are related to [[political ecology]]; the [[development anthropology|anthropology of development]], social movements; [[Latin American]] development and politics. Escobar's research uses critical techniques in his provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general. He also explores possibilities for alternative visions for a [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] era.\n\nHe is a major figure in the post-development academic discourse, and a serious critic of development practices championed by western industrialized societies. According to Escobar, the problem with development is that it is external and based on the model of the industrialized world; instead, what is needed instead are more \"[[endogenous]] discourses\"(Pieterse, 2010).\n\n===Criticism of development===\nEscobar's contends in his 1995 book ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'' that [[international development]] became a mechanism of control comparable to [[colonialism]] or \"[[cultural imperialism]] that poor countries had little means of declining politely\".<ref name=guard/> The book, which won the 1996 Best Book Prize of the New England Council of Latin American Studies,<ref name=umass>{{cite news|title=UMass Amherst Anthropology Professor Arturo Escobar Wins Guggenheim Fellowship|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-anthropology-professor-arturo-escobar-wins-guggenheim-fellowship|work=[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] News & Media Relations|date=23 April 1997}}</ref> traced the rise and fall of development through [[Michel Foucault]]'s [[discourse analysis]], which regards development as [[ontological]]ly cultural (i.e., by examining linguistic structure and meaning). This led him to conclude that \"development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live\".<ref name=guard/> Citing Foucault marked a shift in the study of development from realism to interpretivist or [[post-structuralist]] approaches, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned, giving rise to a coordinated and coherent set of interventions that Escobar calls the \"development apparatus\".\n\nEscobar theorizes that the development era was produced by a discursive construction contained in [[Harry S. Truman]]'s official representation of his administration's foreign policy. By referring to the three continents of South America, Africa, and Asia as \"underdeveloped\" and in need of significant change to achieve progress, Truman set in motion a reorganization of bureaucracy around thinking and acting to systematically change the \"[[third world]]\". In addition, he argues that Truman's discursive construction was infused with the imperatives of American [[social reproduction]] and [[American imperialism|imperial pretensions]]. As a result, the development apparatus functioned to support the consolidation of [[American hegemony]].\n\nEscobar encourages scholars to use [[ethnographic]] methods to further the post-development era by advancing the deconstructive creations initiated by contemporary social movements (without claiming universal applicability). Indeed, the Colombia case study in ''Encountering Development'' demonstrates that development economists' \"economization of food\" resulted in ambitious plans but not necessarily less hunger. A new 2011 edition of the book begins with a substantial new introduction, in which he argues that \"postdevelopment\" needs to be redefined and that a field of \"pluriversal studies\" would be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'', Arturo Escobar (with a new preface by the author)|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9564.html|website=[[Princeton University Press]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political ecology===\nEscobar received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in 1997 to study \"Cultural and Biological Diversity in the Late Twentieth Century\".<ref name=umass/> This project culminated in the publication of his latest book, ''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008, which \"analyzes the politics of difference enacted by specific place-based ethnic and environmental movements in the context of [[Neoliberalism#Globalization|neoliberal globalization]]\".<ref name=amazon>{{cite web|title=''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' (New Ecologies for the Twenty-First Century)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Territories-Difference-Movements-Ecologies-Twenty-First/dp/0822343274|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> It was written after years of [[fieldwork]] in Colombia with a group of [[Afro-Colombian]] activists of [[Pacific/Choc\u00f3 natural region|Colombia\u2019s Pacific rainforest region]] called the ''Proceso de Comunidades Negras'' (PCN).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Claudia|title=Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes (review)|journal=The Americas|date=April 2011|volume=67|issue=4|pages=573\u2013574.|doi=10.1353/tam.2011.0062}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*2018.

According to Escobar, the problem with development is that it is external and based on the model of the industrialized world; instead, what is needed instead are more \"[[endogenous]] discourses\".(Pieterse, 2010)\n\n===Criticism of development===\nEscobar's contends in his 1995 book ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'' that [[international development]] became a mechanism of control comparable to [[colonialism]] or \"[[cultural imperialism]] that poor countries had little means of declining politely\".<ref name=guard/> The book, which won the 1996 Best Book Prize of the New England Council of Latin American Studies,<ref name=umass>{{cite news|title=UMass Amherst Anthropology Professor Arturo Escobar Wins Guggenheim Fellowship|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-anthropology-professor-arturo-escobar-wins-guggenheim-fellowship|work=[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] News & Media Relations|date=23 April 1997}}</ref> traced the rise and fall of development through [[Michel Foucault]]'s [[discourse analysis]], which regards development as [[ontological]]ly cultural (i.e., by examining linguistic structure and meaning). This led him to conclude that \"development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live\".<ref name=guard/> Citing Foucault marked a shift in the study of development from realism to interpretivist or [[post-structuralist]] approaches, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned, giving rise to a coordinated and coherent set of interventions that Escobar calls the \"development apparatus\".\n\nEscobar theorizes that the development era was produced by a discursive construction contained in [[Harry S. Truman]]'s official representation of his administration's foreign policy. By referring to the three continents of South America, Africa, and Asia as \"underdeveloped\" and in need of significant change to achieve progress, Truman set in motion a reorganization of bureaucracy around thinking and acting to systematically change the \"[[third world]]\". In addition, he argues that Truman's discursive construction was infused with the imperatives of American [[social reproduction]] and [[American imperialism|imperial pretensions]]. As a result, the development apparatus functioned to support the consolidation of [[American hegemony]].\n\nEscobar encourages scholars to use [[ethnographic]] methods to further the post-development era by advancing the deconstructive creations initiated by contemporary social movements (without claiming universal applicability). Indeed, the Colombia case study in ''Encountering Development'' demonstrates that development economists' \"economization of food\" resulted in ambitious plans but not necessarily less hunger. A new 2011 edition of the book begins with a substantial new introduction, in which he argues that \"postdevelopment\" needs to be redefined and that a field of \"pluriversal studies\" would be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'', Arturo Escobar (with a new preface by the author)|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9564.html|website=[[Princeton University Press]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political ecology===\nEscobar received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in 1997 to study \"Cultural and Biological Diversity in the Late Twentieth Century\".<ref name=umass/> This project culminated in the publication of his latest book, ''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008, which \"analyzes the politics of difference enacted by specific place-based ethnic and environmental movements in the context of [[Neoliberalism#Globalization|neoliberal globalization]]\".<ref name=amazon>{{cite web|title=''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' (New Ecologies for the Twenty-First Century)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Territories-Difference-Movements-Ecologies-Twenty-First/dp/0822343274|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> It was written after years of [[fieldwork]] in Colombia with a group of [[Afro-Colombian]] activists of [[Pacific/Choc\u00f3 natural region|Colombia\u2019s Pacific rainforest region]] called the ''Proceso de Comunidades Negras'' (PCN).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Claudia|title=Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes (review)|journal=The Americas|date=April 2011|volume=67|issue=4|pages=573\u2013574.|doi=10.1353/tam.2011.0062}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*2018.

Recovered individuals have reached up to {{convert|4|-|4.2|m|1}} in height, and an estimated {{convert|11.3|-|15|t}} in weight. The straight-tusked elephant probably lived in small herds, flourishing in [[interglacial]] periods, when its range would extend as far as Great Britain. Isolated tusks are often found while partial or whole skeletons are rare, and there is evidence of predation by early humans. It is a possible ancestor of [[dwarf elephant]]s that later inhabited islands in the [[Mediterranean]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Elephas-antiquus.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration]]\n''Palaeoloxodon antiquus'' was quite large, with individuals reaching {{convert|4|m|ft|1}} in height.

For example, a tusk of this elephant was found during the construction of the [[The Ebbsfleet Academy|Swan Valley Community School]] in [[Swanscombe]], Kent. However, finds of whole or partial skeletons of this elephant are very rare.\n\nSkeleton finds in Britain are known from only a few sites. Two sites were found in the Lower [[Thames]] basin, one at [[Upnor]], [[Kent]] and one at [[Aveley]], [[Essex]]. Paleontological and archaeological excavations in advance of [[High Speed 1]] revealed the 400,000-year-old skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant in the [[Ebbsfleet Valley]], near Swanscombe. It was lying at the edge of what would once have been a small lake. Flint tools lay scattered around, suggesting the elephant had been cut up by a tribe of the early humans around at the time, known as ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.<ref>BBC News. 2006.

Sites where early humans and the straight-tusked elephant appear together have been frequently documented. One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river. A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was found with a [[yew]] [[spear]] between the ribs, and [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] artifacts around the head.

Recovered individuals have reached up to {{convert|4|-|4.2|m|1}} in height, and an estimated {{convert|11.3|-|15|t}} in weight. The straight-tusked elephant probably lived in small herds, flourishing in [[interglacial]] periods, when its range would extend as far as Great Britain. Isolated tusks are often found while partial or whole skeletons are rare, and there is evidence of predation by early humans.

For example, a tusk of this elephant was found during the construction of the [[The Ebbsfleet Academy|Swan Valley Community School]] in [[Swanscombe]], Kent. However, finds of whole or partial skeletons of this elephant are very rare.\n\nSkeleton finds in Britain are known from only a few sites. Two sites were found in the Lower [[Thames]] basin, one at [[Upnor]], [[Kent]] and one at [[Aveley]], [[Essex]]. Paleontological and archaeological excavations in advance of [[High Speed 1]] revealed the 400,000-year-old skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant in the [[Ebbsfleet Valley]], near Swanscombe. It was lying at the edge of what would once have been a small lake. Flint tools lay scattered around, suggesting the elephant had been cut up by a tribe of the early humans around at the time, known as ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.<ref>BBC News. 2006.

Sites where early humans and the straight-tusked elephant appear together have been frequently documented. One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river. A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was found with a [[yew]] [[spear]] between the ribs, and [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] artifacts around the head.

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth International Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. Winslow has visions of a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration.<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

When he sees her enlarged vagina (based off shark genitalia)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Stern|first=Marlow|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-lighthouse-robert-pattinson-gets-weird-in-the-most-bonkers-movie-sex-scene-of-the-year|title=The Most Bonkers Movie Sex Scene of the Year Features a Very Horny Robert Pattinson and a Mermaid|date=October 17, 2019|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> he runs screaming. Barton interprets his reaction, stating that it \"is fairly obvious \u2013 the mermaid was never Tommy\u2019s siren. His true siren is revealed a little later.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Dafoe, the homoeroticism in the film is blatant, but it is also used to explore what it means to be a man: \"[[Toxic masculinity]]! They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong. There\u2019s no moral judgment in this story. It\u2019s just to watch these two guys struggling to find a way to survive themselves, really... It\u2019s a simple story, but it\u2019s got existential roots and identity things and things about masculinity and domination and submission. And for better and for worse. Then you see it flip-flop and it\u2019s kind of cool.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> After beating Wake into submission, Howard assumes a dominant role, calling Wake dog and dragging him on a leash. Commenting on this scene, Pattinson stated that, \"there\u2019s definitely a take where we were literally trying to pull each other\u2019s pants down. It literally almost looked like foreplay\u201d.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/jojo-rabbit-the-lighthouse-gay-subtext-1202182957/|title=Why the Gay Subplots in \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 and \u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019 Don\u2019t Go Far Enough|last=Dry|first=Jude|date=21 October 2019|website=IndieWire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJude Dry of IndieWire critiqued the film's queer subtext for not going far enough. As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]]<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>, and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\"<ref name=\":1\" />. According to Pattinson the [[Phallus|phallic]] imagery of the lighthouse is explicit, as Eggers described it as an erect penis in the script<ref name=\":1\" />.The film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to [Pattinson's] actual erect penis\u201d, although this cut was removed upon request by financiers<ref name=\":2\" />. Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\"<ref name=\":1\" />. As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>. Jealous of his access to the lighthouse which symbolizes the phallus, he must kill his father figure in order to gain it.\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\". <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film<ref name=\":5\" />. Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake. Manohla Dargus of the ''New York Times'' notes that \"the men\u2019s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-lighthouse-review.html|title=\u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 Review: Dark Nights, Troubled Souls, Hairy Men|date=16 Oct 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Their alcoholism in many ways enables the homoerotic themes in the film.\n\n==Release==\n''The Lighthouse'' had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section on May 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/ |title=Cannes: Directors' Fortnight Includes Robert Pattinson Pic 'The Lighthouse', Takashi Miike, Netflix Film 'Wounds' & Luca Guadagnino Short |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Andreas |last=Wiseman |date=April 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423123423/https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019 |date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140739/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was distributed by [[A24 (company)|A24]] in North America and by [[Focus Features]] internationally.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |title=Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe's 'The Lighthouse' Wins Cannes Critics' Award |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |accessdate=June 19, 2019 |work=Variety |publisher=Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC |date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608234429/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/ |title='The Lighthouse' First Trailer: Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe Go Mad in A24 Psychodrama |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Zack |last=Sharf |date=July 30, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730130858/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/|archive-date=July 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its limited opening weekend on October 18, the film grossed $419,764 from eight theaters, for an average of $52,471 per venue.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-zombieland-double-tap-weekend-box-office-1202763525/ |title= 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' No Magic With $36M+, 'Joker' Still Stealing 2nd Place From 'Zombieland 2' With $28M+ |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 20, 2019 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> In its second weekend the film expanded to 586 theaters, grossing $3 million and finishing eighth at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-maleficent-2-black-and-blue-countdown-halloween-box-office-weekend-1202769043/ |title= 'Joker' Has The Edge Over 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' With $18.9M In Fierce Slow Pre-Halloween B.O.

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth International Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. Winslow has visions of a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration.<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

No. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not either. Forget about complexities of human sexuality or their particular inclinations.

Barton interprets Howard's name change to his previous, deceased boss as indicative of a more intimate relationship: \"Considering the act of Tommy taking his name, this behavior suggests a tender and affectionate attitude, almost like the tradition of taking your partner's name after marriage\".<ref name=\":0\" /> When asked about the scene in which Winslow criticizes Wake's cooking, Wake's desperate need for validation of his lobster is a euphemism for his penis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSexual fantasy and masturbation are recurring themes in the film. Winslow frequently masturbates to the mermaid figurine throughout the film. He fantasizes of a mermaid washed up on the shore. When he sees her enlarged vagina (based off shark genitalia)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Stern|first=Marlow|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-lighthouse-robert-pattinson-gets-weird-in-the-most-bonkers-movie-sex-scene-of-the-year|title=The Most Bonkers Movie Sex Scene of the Year Features a Very Horny Robert Pattinson and a Mermaid|date=October 17, 2019|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> he runs screaming. Barton interprets his reaction, stating that it \"is fairly obvious \u2013 the mermaid was never Tommy\u2019s siren. His true siren is revealed a little later.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Dafoe, the homoeroticism in the film is blatant, but it is also used to explore what it means to be a man: \"[[Toxic masculinity]]! They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong. There\u2019s no moral judgment in this story. It\u2019s just to watch these two guys struggling to find a way to survive themselves, really... It\u2019s a simple story, but it\u2019s got existential roots and identity things and things about masculinity and domination and submission. And for better and for worse. Then you see it flip-flop and it\u2019s kind of cool.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> After beating Wake into submission, Howard assumes a dominant role, calling Wake dog and dragging him on a leash. Commenting on this scene, Pattinson stated that, \"there\u2019s definitely a take where we were literally trying to pull each other\u2019s pants down. It literally almost looked like foreplay\u201d.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/jojo-rabbit-the-lighthouse-gay-subtext-1202182957/|title=Why the Gay Subplots in \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 and \u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019 Don\u2019t Go Far Enough|last=Dry|first=Jude|date=21 October 2019|website=IndieWire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJude Dry of IndieWire critiqued the film's queer subtext for not going far enough. As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]]<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>, and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\"<ref name=\":1\" />. According to Pattinson the [[Phallus|phallic]] imagery of the lighthouse is explicit, as Eggers's described it as an erect penis in the script<ref name=\":1\" />.The film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to [Pattinson's] actual erect penis\u201d, although this cut was removed upon request by financiers<ref name=\":2\" />. Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\"<ref name=\":1\" />. As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>. Jealous of his access to the lighthouse which symbolizes the phallus, he must kill his father figure in order to gain it.\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\". <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film<ref name=\":5\" />. Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake. Manohla Dargus of the ''New York Times'' notes that \"the men\u2019s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-lighthouse-review.html|title=\u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 Review: Dark Nights, Troubled Souls, Hairy Men|date=16 Oct 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Their alcoholism in many ways enables the homoerotic themes in the film.\n\n==Release==\n''The Lighthouse'' had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section on May 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/ |title=Cannes: Directors' Fortnight Includes Robert Pattinson Pic 'The Lighthouse', Takashi Miike, Netflix Film 'Wounds' & Luca Guadagnino Short |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Andreas |last=Wiseman |date=April 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423123423/https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019 |date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140739/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was distributed by [[A24 (company)|A24]] in North America and by [[Focus Features]] internationally.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |title=Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe's 'The Lighthouse' Wins Cannes Critics' Award |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |accessdate=June 19, 2019 |work=Variety |publisher=Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC |date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608234429/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/ |title='The Lighthouse' First Trailer: Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe Go Mad in A24 Psychodrama |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Zack |last=Sharf |date=July 30, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730130858/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/|archive-date=July 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its limited opening weekend on October 18, the film grossed $419,764 from eight theaters, for an average of $52,471 per venue.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-zombieland-double-tap-weekend-box-office-1202763525/ |title= 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' No Magic With $36M+, 'Joker' Still Stealing 2nd Place From 'Zombieland 2' With $28M+ |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 20, 2019 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> In its second weekend the film expanded to 586 theaters, grossing $3 million and finishing eighth at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-maleficent-2-black-and-blue-countdown-halloween-box-office-weekend-1202769043/ |title= 'Joker' Has The Edge Over 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' With $18.9M In Fierce Slow Pre-Halloween B.O.

Incorporators included [[William H. Aspinwall]], Edwin Bartlett (American consul at [[Lima, Peru]] and also involved with the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railroad Company]]),<ref>Thomas Edward Bartlett, The Bartletts: Ancestral, Genealogical, Biographical, Historical. Comprising an Account of the American Progenitors of the Bartlett Family, with Special Reference to the Descendants of John Bartlett, of Weymouth and Cumberland (Stafford Printing Co. 1902) p. 95, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=9j5AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg</ref> Henry Chauncey, Mr. Alsop, G.G. Howland and S.S. Howland. \n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nThe Pacific Mail Steamship Company was established to carry US mail on the Pacific leg of a transcontinental route via Panama. The federal government discussed the possibility of creating subsidies for a private shipping company, similar to the model already established in Britain for the Cunard Line and the British Mail Steam Packet Company. Such a policy served the larger objective of annexing and developing Oregon. President [[James K. Polk]] brought the Oregon Territory into the Union in 1846. Developing and maintaining the new land required the development of faster transportation and communications between the eastern seaboard and the remote northwest.<ref name=kemble>{{cite journal|last=Kemble|first=John Haskell|title=The Genesis of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=13|issue=3|date=September 1934|pages=240\u2013254|jstor=25160527}}</ref>\n  \nAt first the federal mail subsidy program served a second objective: the establishment of civilian steamships which could be easily converted to warships or privateers during times of war. Thus the 1845 federal enabling legislation vested authority of mail contracts with the [[Secretary of the United States Navy|Secretary of the US Navy]]. His dual mandate was letting federal mail contracts and overseeing the construction of the steamers to ensure that they would be suitable for conversion to warships. In accordance to Polk\u2019s aggressive program for developing Oregon, Congress passed more specific laws in for mail subsidies early in 1847. The new laws approved funding for four naval steamers, directed the US Department of the Navy to supervise the construction of these ships, and directed the Secretary of the Navy to contract with private carriers to carry US Mail to Oregon via Panama. Initially they planned for monthly mail service. One set of ships was to serve the Atlantic leg between the eastern US and Panama; the other set was to serve the Pacific leg.<ref name=kemble/>\n\n[[John Y. Mason|Secretary Mason]] set the terms for the Pacific mail contract: a steamer would be required to sail from Panama to [[Astoria, Oregon]] in thirty days or less. He awarded the first contract to Arnold Harris, a straw buyer from Arkansas. The contract paid $199,000 annually and was in effect for ten years.

During the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1849, the company was a key mover of goods and people and played a key role in the growth of [[San Francisco]], California.\n\nIn addition to their maritime activities Pacific Mail also ran some of the earliest steamboats on the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s, between [[San Francisco]], [[Sacramento]], and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].  [[Domingo Marcucci]] came from Philadelphia in the Pacific Mail steamship ''SS Oregon'' with a knocked-down steamboat in its hold.  He started a shipyard in San Francisco on September 18, 1849, on the beach at [[South of Market, San Francisco|Happy Valley]], at the foot of Folsom Street, east of Beale Street.  Marcucci's company assembled  the [[Captain Sutter (Sternwheeler)|''Captain Sutter'']] in six weeks.  Built for the [[Aspinwall Steam Transportation Line]], owned by George W.

In April 1851, the rivalry was ended when the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side, and George Law sold his new company and its ships to the Pacific Mail.

After one of these plots, that of the [[Salvador Pirates]]  came to light, to prevent any further attempts to seize Pacific coast shipping, General McDowell ordered each passenger on board American merchant steamers to surrender all weapons when boarding the ship and every passenger and his baggage was searched.

Incorporators included [[William H. Aspinwall]], Edwin Bartlett (American consul at [[Lima, Peru]] and also involved with the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railroad Company]]),<ref>Thomas Edward Bartlett, The Bartletts: Ancestral, Genealogical, Biographical, Historical.

Howland and S.S. Howland. \n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nThe Pacific Mail Steamship Company was established to carry US mail on the Pacific leg of a transcontinental route via Panama. The federal government discussed the possibility of creating subsidies for a private shipping company, similar to the model already established in Britain for the Cunard Line and the British Mail Steam Packet Company. Such a policy served the larger objective of annexing and developing Oregon. President [[James K. Polk]] brought the Oregon Territory into the Union in 1846. Developing and maintaining the new land required the development of faster transportation and communications between the eastern seaboard and the remote northwest.<ref name=kemble>{{cite journal|last=Kemble|first=John Haskell|title=The Genesis of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=13|issue=3|date=September 1934|pages=240\u2013254|jstor=25160527}}</ref>\n  \nAt first the federal mail subsidy program served a second objective: the establishment of civilian steamships which could be easily converted to warships or privateers during times of war. Thus the 1845 federal enabling legislation vested authority of mail contracts with the [[Secretary of the United States Navy|Secretary of the US Navy]]. His dual mandate was letting federal mail contracts and overseeing the construction of the steamers to ensure that they would be suitable for conversion to warships. In accordance to Polk\u2019s aggressive program for developing Oregon, Congress passed more specific laws in for mail subsidies early in 1847. The new laws approved funding for four naval steamers, directed the US Department of the Navy to supervise the construction of these ships, and directed the Secretary of the Navy to contract with private carriers to carry US Mail to Oregon via Panama. Initially they planned for monthly mail service. One set of ships was to serve the Atlantic leg between the eastern US and Panama; the other set was to serve the Pacific leg.<ref name=kemble/>\n\n[[John Y. Mason|Secretary Mason]] set the terms for the Pacific mail contract: a steamer would be required to sail from Panama to [[Astoria, Oregon]] in thirty days or less. He awarded the first contract to Arnold Harris, a straw buyer from Arkansas. The contract paid $199,000 annually and was in effect for ten years. Just days later, Harris assigned the mail contract to William H. Aspinwall, who brought in three partners: Edwin Bartlett, Henry Chauncey, and Gardiner G. Howland. They incorporated the Pacific Mail Steamship Company on April 12, 1848 with a capital stock of $500,000.<ref name=kemble/>\n\n===California Gold Rush===\nThe first three steamships constructed for Pacific Mail were the {{SS|California|1848|6}}, of 1050 tons, the ''[[SS Oregon]]'', of 1250 tons, and the ''[[SS Panama]]'', of 1058 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Benjamin C.|title=San Francisco's Ocean Trade|date=1911|publisher=A.

During the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1849, the company was a key mover of goods and people and played a key role in the growth of [[San Francisco]], California.\n\nIn addition to their maritime activities Pacific Mail also ran some of the earliest steamboats on the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s, between [[San Francisco]], [[Sacramento]], and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].  [[Domingo Marcucci]] came from Philadelphia in the Pacific Mail steamship ''SS Oregon'' with a knocked-down steamboat in its hold.  He started a shipyard in San Francisco on September 18, 1849, on the beach at [[South of Market, San Francisco|Happy Valley]], at the foot of Folsom Street, east of Beale Street.  Marcucci's company assembled  the [[Captain Sutter (Sternwheeler)|''Captain Sutter'']] in six weeks.  Built for the [[Aspinwall Steam Transportation Line]], owned by George W. Aspinwall, brother of [[William Henry Aspinwall]], it was one of the first steamboats that ran between San Francisco and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], in 1849.<ref name=Marcucci>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7I8xAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false  Scott, Erving M. and Others, ''Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part I'', ''Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine'', Volume 25, January 1895, pp.5-16]; Quod.lib.umich.edu accessed March 10, 2015</ref>{{rp|13}} <ref name=foundsf>[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Steamboat_Point,_1851-1864  Nancy J.

Subsequently in March 1850, for the same company, he assembled the [[Georgiana (side-wheeler)|''Georgiana'']], a small 30 ton side-wheel steamboat made in Philadelphia, knocked down and sent by sea also for the Sacramento run.  That April ''Georgiana'' pioneered the shortcut route between Sacramento and Stockton through a [[slough (hydrology)|slough]] in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]] that was between the [[Sacramento River]] and [[Mokelumne River]], which afterward became known as [[Georgiana Slough]].<ref name=Marcucci/>{{rp|14}}\n\n===1850\u20131869===\nIn 1850, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company established a steamship line competing with the [[U.S. Mail Steamship Company]] between [[New York City]] and [[Chagres]]. [[George Law (financier)|George Law]] placed an opposition line of steamers (SS Antelope, SS Columbus, SS Isthumus, SS Republic) in the Pacific, running from [[Panama]] to [[San Francisco]]. In April 1851, the rivalry was ended when the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side, and George Law sold his new company and its ships to the Pacific Mail.  One of the company's steamships, the [[SS Winfield Scott]], acquired when the [[New York and California Steamship Company]] went out of business, ran aground on [[Anacapa Island]] in 1853.\n\n[[File:Pacific Mail SS Advert 1906.jpg|thumb|upright|1906 Advertisement from ''The World Today'' magazine]]\n[[File:Pacific Mail Steamship Company advertisement in California Expositions brochure\u20141915.png|thumb|upright|1915 Advertisement showing new ships in Trans Pacific service.]]\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the ships of the Pacific Mail, that carried the gold and silver of the western mines to the eastern states were under threat from the [[Confederate Navy]] in the form of commerce raiders, and several plots to seize one of their steamships for its precious cargo or to convert it into a raider to capture one of its other ships with such cargo.  After one of these plots, that of the [[Salvador Pirates]] came to light, to prevent any further attempts to seize Pacific coast shipping, General McDowell ordered each passenger on board American merchant steamers to surrender all weapons when boarding the ship and every passenger and his baggage was searched. All officers were armed for the protection of their ships.
