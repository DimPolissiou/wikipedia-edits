By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the [[trestle (mill)|trestle]]. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the 19th century, when more powerful [[tower mill|tower]] and [[smock mill]]s replaced them.<ref>Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 65</ref>\n\n==== Hollow-post mill ====\nIn a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Windmills\n | author = Martin Watts\n | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n | year = 2006\n | isbn = 978-0-7478-0653-0\n | page = 55\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ7-M8lFo_UC&pg=PA55\n }}</ref>\nThis makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the 14th century onwards.<ref name=\"Hau2013\">{{cite book|author=Erich Hau|title=Wind Turbines: Fundamentals, Technologies, Application, Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeNEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=26 February 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-27151-9|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Tower mill ===\n{{main|Tower mill}}\n[[File:Molinos de Consuegra.jpg|right|thumb|Tower mills in [[Consuegra]], Spain]]\nBy the end of the 13th century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a [[Windmill fantail|fantail]], a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n=== Smock mill ===\n{{main|Smock mill}}\n[[File:Greetsieler Zwillingsm\u00fchlen 2010.jpg|thumb|Two [[smock mill]]s with a stage in [[Greetsiel]], [[Germany]]]]\n\nThe smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the \"smock\", which is thatched, boarded or covered by other materials, such as [[roofing slate|slate]], [[sheet metal]], or [[tar paper]]. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides. The lighter weight than tower mills make smock mills practical as drainage mills, which often had to be built in areas with unstable subsoil. Smock mills originated for drainage, but are also used for other purposes. When used in a built-up area it is often placed on a masonry base to raise it above the surrounding buildings.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n=== Sails ===\n{{main|Windmill sail}}\n[[File:Kuremaa m\u00f5isa tuuleveski.jpg|thumb|Windmill in [[Kuremaa]], [[Estonia]]]]\n\nCommon sails consist of a lattice framework on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions.<ref name=\"lowtechmag\" /> The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nIn all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by [[William Cubitt]] in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nIn France, [[Pierre-Th\u00e9ophile Berton]] invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\nThe majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire]]), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia.<ref name=Sailno>{{Citation | first = Rex| last = Wailes| authorlink= Rex Wailes| year = 1954| title = The English Windmill| pages = 99\u2013104| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul| location = London | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref> A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n[[File:Korenmolen \"De Valk\" in rouwstand naar aanleiding van bijzetting te Delft van Koningin Wilhelmina - Leiden - 20137630 - RCE.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:De Valk (Leiden)|De Valk]] windmill in mourning position following the death of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] in 1962]]\nIn the Netherlands the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. If the blades are stopped in a \"+\" sign (3-6-9-12 o'clock), the windmill is open for business. When the blades are stopped in an \"X\" configuration, the windmill is closed or not functional. A slight tilt of the sails (top blade at 1 o'clock) signals joy, such as the birth of a healthy baby. A tilt of the blades to 11-2-5-8 o'clock signals mourning, or warning. It was used to signal the local region  during Nazi operations in World War II, such as searches for Jews. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning position in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 [[Malaysian Airlines Flight 17|Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown]].<ref>{{cite web|title=In somber ceremony, Dutch receive the first remains of MH17 victims|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Machinery ===\n{{Main|Mill machinery}}\n\nGears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In [[grist mill]]s, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each [[millstone]]. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.\nThe machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A [[windpump|drainage mill]] uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Sawmill]]s use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including [[papermill]]s, [[threshing]] mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gregory, R.

Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as backup to the modern pumping stations. The [[Zaanse Schans|Zaan district]] has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Stockhuyzen\" /> Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.\n\nConstruction of mills spread to the [[Cape Colony]] in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the [[Cape Peninsula]], so in 1717 the [[Heeren XVII]] sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the ''Oude Molen'' and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]]. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=53 |title=Local Windmills |publisher=Mostertsmill.co.za |accessdate=2013-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808134216/http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=53 |archivedate=2013-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Wind turbines ==\n{{main|Wind power|High-altitude wind power}}\n[[File:\u897f\u7538\u5b50\u6881\u98ce\u8f66 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A group of wind turbines in [[Zhangjiakou]], China]]\nA [[wind turbine]] is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity.

By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the [[trestle (mill)|trestle]]. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the 19th century, when more powerful [[tower mill|tower]] and [[smock mill]]s replaced them.<ref>Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 65</ref>\n\n==== Hollow-post mill ====\nIn a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Windmills\n | author = Martin Watts\n | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n | year = 2006\n | isbn = 978-0-7478-0653-0\n | page = 55\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ7-M8lFo_UC&pg=PA55\n }}</ref>\nThis makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the 14th century onwards.<ref name=\"Hau2013\">{{cite book|author=Erich Hau|title=Wind Turbines: Fundamentals, Technologies, Application, Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeNEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=26 February 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-27151-9|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Tower mill ===\n{{main|Tower mill}}\n[[File:Molinos de Consuegra.jpg|right|thumb|Tower mills in [[Consuegra]], Spain]]\nBy the end of the 13th century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a [[Windmill fantail|fantail]], a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n=== Smock mill ===\n{{main|Smock mill}}\n[[File:Greetsieler Zwillingsm\u00fchlen 2010.jpg|thumb|Two [[smock mill]]s with a stage in [[Greetsiel]], [[Germany]]]]\n\nThe smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the \"smock\", which is thatched, boarded or covered by other materials, such as [[roofing slate|slate]], [[sheet metal]], or [[tar paper]]. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides. The lighter weight than tower mills make smock mills practical as drainage mills, which often had to be built in areas with unstable subsoil. Smock mills originated for drainage, but are also used for other purposes. When used in a built-up area it is often placed on a masonry base to raise it above the surrounding buildings.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n=== Sails ===\n{{main|Windmill sail}}\n[[File:Kuremaa m\u00f5isa tuuleveski.jpg|thumb|Windmill in [[Kuremaa]], [[Estonia]]]]\n\nCommon sails consist of a lattice framework on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions.<ref name=\"lowtechmag\" /> The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nIn all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by [[William Cubitt]] in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nIn France, [[Pierre-Th\u00e9ophile Berton]] invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\nThe majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire]]), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia.<ref name=Sailno>{{Citation | first = Rex| last = Wailes| authorlink= Rex Wailes| year = 1954| title = The English Windmill| pages = 99\u2013104| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul| location = London | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref> A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n[[File:Korenmolen \"De Valk\" in rouwstand naar aanleiding van bijzetting te Delft van Koningin Wilhelmina - Leiden - 20137630 - RCE.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:De Valk (Leiden)|De Valk]] windmill in mourning position following the death of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] in 1962]]\nIn the Netherlands the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. If the blades are stopped in a \"+\" sign (3-6-9-12 o'clock), the windmill is open for business. When the blades are stopped in an \"X\" configuration, the windmill is closed or not functional. A slight tilt of the sails (top blade at 1 o'clock) signals joy, such as the birth of a healthy baby. A tilt of the blades to 11-2-5-8 o'clock signals mourning, or warning. It was used to signal the local region  during Nazi operations in World War II, such as searches for Jews. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning position in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 [[Malaysian Airlines Flight 17|Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown]].<ref>{{cite web|title=In somber ceremony, Dutch receive the first remains of MH17 victims|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Machinery ===\n{{Main|Mill machinery}}\n\nGears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In [[grist mill]]s, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each [[millstone]]. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.\nThe machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A [[windpump|drainage mill]] uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Sawmill]]s use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including [[papermill]]s, [[threshing]] mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gregory, R.

The [[Zaanse Schans|Zaan district]] has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Stockhuyzen\" /> Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.\n\nConstruction of mills spread to the [[Cape Colony]] in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the [[Cape Peninsula]], so in 1717 the [[Heeren XVII]] sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the ''Oude Molen'' and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]]. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=53 |title=Local Windmills |publisher=Mostertsmill.co.za |accessdate=2013-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808134216/http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=53 |archivedate=2013-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Wind turbines ==\n{{main|Wind power|High-altitude wind power}}\n[[File:\u897f\u7538\u5b50\u6881\u98ce\u8f66 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A group of wind turbines in [[Zhangjiakou]], China]]\nA [[wind turbine]] is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity.

The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the [[wind turbine design]] technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities.  The modern [[wind power industry]] began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, [[Vestas]], [[NEG Micon|Nordtank]], and [[Siemens|Bonus]]. These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20\u201330&nbsp;kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the [[Enercon E-126]] capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAs the 21st century began, rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]].

At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use.<ref>Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123\u2013127</ref> Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, [[Eclipse windmill|Eclipse]], [[Fairbanks-Morse]], [[Dempsters|Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company]] and [[Aermotor Windmill Company|Aermotor]] became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.\n\nIn Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at [[Toowoomba]] manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876, with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903.

The [[dance-pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[synth-pop]] track details Kiyoko confronting an ex-girlfriend she believes is dating a man to mask her true feelings for Kiyoko. Its title adopts \"[[Bi-curious|curious]]\", a term used within the [[LGBT]] community to express same-sex experimentation, as Kiyoko demands the truth about the authenticity of her love interest's new relationship.\n\nKiyoko wrote \"Curious\" based on a past relationship with a [[closeted]] woman, as well as various romantic experiences with women who were unsure about their sexuality, hoping that the song would encourage an open dialogue among [[queer]] individuals. \"Curious\" has earned acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised its production, [[Subversion|subversive]] themes and Kiyoko's confident delivery, often deeming it one of ''Expectations''<nowiki/>' strongest tracks; some media publications have ranked \"Curious\" among the best songs of 2018.\n\nA music video for \"Curious\" was released the same day as the single, which Kiyoko co-directed with James Larese. Actress Tereza Kacerova co-stars as Kiyoko's love interest, who she encounters at a house party she is attending with her new boyfriend ([[Henry Zaga]] ). Critics praised the video's visuals, choreography and Kiyoko's direction, as well as its sensual depiction of a lesbian relationship. Kiyoko has performed \"Curious\" live several times, including on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', at the [[2018 MTV Video Music Awards]] and during her [[Expectations Tour]]. Kiyoko also performed \"Curious\" with singer [[Taylor Swift]] during the latter's [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018).\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Curious\" was written by [[Hayley Kiyoko]] with [[Terror Jr|Lisa Vitale]], Brandon Colbein, [[Jack & Coke|Jakob Hazell]] and [[Svante Halldin]].<ref name=\":33\">{{Cite

It was released as the album's third single on January 11, 2018 by [[Empire Distribution|Empire]]/[[Atlantic Records]]. Kiyoko co-wrote \"Curious\" with [[Terror Jr|Lisa Vitale]], Brandon Colbein, Jakob Hazell and Svante Halldin, while [[Jack & Coke]] (Halldin and Hazell) produced the song. The [[dance-pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[synth-pop]] track details Kiyoko confronting an ex-girlfriend she believes is dating a man to mask her true feelings for Kiyoko. Its title adopts \"[[Bi-curious|curious]]\", a term used within the [[LGBT]] community to express same-sex experimentation, as Kiyoko demands the truth about the authenticity of her love interest's new relationship.\n\nKiyoko wrote \"Curious\" based on a past relationship with a [[closeted]] woman, as well as various romantic experiences with women who were unsure about their sexuality, hoping that the song would encourage an open dialogue among [[queer]] individuals. \"Curious\" has earned acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised its production, [[Subversion|subversive]] themes and Kiyoko's confident delivery, often deeming it one of ''Expectations''<nowiki/>' strongest tracks; some media publications have ranked \"Curious\" among the best songs of 2018.\n\nA music video for \"Curious\" was released the same day as the single, which Kiyoko co-directed with James Larese. Actress Tereza Kacerova co-stars as Kiyoko's love interest, who she encounters at a house party she is attending with her new boyfriend ([[Henry Zaga]] ). Critics praised the video's visuals, choreography and Kiyoko's direction, as well as its sensual depiction of a lesbian relationship. Kiyoko has performed \"Curious\" live several times, including on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', at the [[2018 MTV Video Music Awards]] and during her [[Expectations Tour]]. Kiyoko also performed \"Curious\" with singer [[Taylor Swift]] during the latter's [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018).\n\n== Background and writing
