Once Sajani is out of earshot, Anna jokingly orders Living Brain to terminate her, but he responds that his programming prevents him from complying. Anna remarks that she'll have to upgrade his sarcasm-detection software and sets off to comply with Sajani's orders.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLiving Brain has the ability to analyze any situation and determine how best to achieve its goals. Like any computer, Living Brain can process and collate large amounts of information. Living Brain can find any weaknesses in a being or structure as well as determining the best situation to overcome this obstacle. Living Brain has dense metal exo-skeleton and possesses super-strength and speed. It can also fly and has clawed hands. The joints of Living Brain's limbs can rotate nearly 360 degrees. Originally, Living Brain had external controls on its thorax, with which it can be deactivated, yet Living Brain has always countered any attempts to reach it. Living Brain was later operated by remote-control. The Living Brain has great strength, ability to move upon command and its limbs can perform various motions...It has the ability to think due to its great computerized \"brain\"...It was short-circuited after its first introduction in the school and went hay-wire until Peter readjusted the machine back to normal. The \"souped-up\" later version had the ability to hover or fly and was quite stronger. He has even beaten the Avengers once due to his extreme intelligence.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Age===\nIn the ''[[Marvel Age]]'' Universe, the Living Brain (radically redesigned, with a humanoid shape somewhat similar to the [[DC Comics]] character [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]]) appears in a more modern re-telling of its original appearance in the comics. The Living Brain, was developed by [[Roxxon]] to demonstrate itself at Peter's school, Midtown High. It is taken down due to an inability to deduce Spider-Man's identity, however two students decide to use the robot to steal for them. However they accidentally switch him into defense mode, tearing through the school, until de-activated by Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic\n | Writer = Todd Dezago\n | Penciller = Jonboy Meyers\n | Inker = Pat Davidson\n | Story = The Terrible Threat Of The Living Brain\n | Title = Marvel Age Spider-Man\n | Volume = 1\n | Issue = 7\n | Date = Sept. 2004\n | Publisher = Marvel Comics\n }}</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nThe Living Brain appears among the villains defeated by Spider-Man in ''What If?: J.

Its first appearance is in the episode \"Brain Drain\", in which Otto Octavius's consciousness is revealed to be inside it, playing along as being a robot servant until tricking Spider-Man into getting an energy-focal device (having orchestrated the \"Bring on the Bad Guys\" arc). In its-self titled episode, the Living Brain's objective in Octavius's plan is revealed when switching bodies with Spider-Man. In the episode \"Critical Update\", the Living Brain's remains are recovered by [[Max Modell]], enabling Peter's consciousness to escape the machine using the Neruo Cortex.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Living_Brain_%28Earth-616%29 Living Brain] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/livbrain.htm|Living Brain}}\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProjectComics-->\n|character_name = Living Brain\n|image = LivingBrainOriginal.png\n|caption = The Living Brain's original appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #8.

The location in the present day is the hill of [[Hisarlik]] and its immediate vicinity. In modern scholarly nomenclature, the Ridge of Troy (including Hisarlik) borders the Plain of Troy, flat agricultural land, which conducts the lower [[Karamenderes River|Scamander River]] to the strait. Troy was the setting of the [[Trojan War]] described in the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], in particular in the ''[[Iliad]]'', one of the two epic poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[metre (poetry)|Metrical]] evidence from the ''Iliad'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' suggests that the name {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (''Ilion'') formerly began with a [[digamma]]: {{lang|grc|\u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (''Wilion'');<ref name=met group=note/> this is also supported by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name for what is thought to be the same city, [[Wilusa]].\n\nAfter a destruction at the end of the Bronze Age, believed to represent the end of the Trojan War, and a period of abandonment or near-abandonment during the subsequent Dark Age, the site acquired a new population of Greek-speakers, who built a classical city that became along with the rest of Anatolia a part of the Persian Empire. The Troad was liberated by Alexander the Great, an admirer of Achilles, who he believed had the same type of glorious (but short-lived) destiny. After the Roman conquest of this now Hellenistic Greek-speaking world, a new capital called '''Ilium''' (from Greek: \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Ilion'') was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric, was abandoned, repopulated for a few centuries in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], was abandoned again, and is now a Latin Catholic [[titular see]]. Most recently it has risen to prominence as an archaeological site.\n\nIn the mid-19th century the Calvert family, wealthy Levantine English settlers of the Troad, occupying a working farm a few miles from Hisarlik, purchased much of the hill in the belief that it contained the ruins of Troy. They were antiquarians. Two of the family, Frederick and especially the youngest, Frank, surveyed the Troad and conducted a number of trial excavations there. In 1865, [[Frank Calvert]] excavated trial trenches on the hill, discovering the Roman settlement. Realizing he did not have the funds for a full excavation, he attempted to recruit the British Museum, and was refused. A chance meeting with Calvert in [[\u00c7anakkale]] and a visit to the site by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also looking for Troy, offered a second opportunity for funding.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=54\u201355}}.</ref> Schliemann had been at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |title=The Trojans and their neighbours |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-34959-8 |page=37}}</ref> As Schliemann was about to leave the area, Calvert wrote to him asking him to take over the entire excavation. Schliemann agreed. The Calverts, who made their money in the diplomatic service, expedited the acquisition of a Turkish [[firman]]. In 1868, Schliemann excavated an initial deep trench across the mound called today \"Schliemann's trench.\" These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Subsequent excavations by following archaeologists elaborated on the number and dates of the cities. \n\nToday a small village near the ruins, Tevfikiye, supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site. It lies within the [[\u00c7anakkale Province|province of \u00c7anakkale]], some {{convert|30|km|mi}} south-west of the provincial capital, also called \u00c7anakkale. The current map shows Ilium a little way inland from the Scamander estuary across the plain of Troy. According to Korfmann, due to Troy's location near the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Black Sea]], it was a central hub for military activities and trade, and the chief site of a culture he calls the \"Maritime Troja Culture,\" which extended over the region between the Black and Aegean Seas.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=27}}</ref>\n\nTroy was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.\n\n== Homeric Troy ==\n[[File:Polyxena_Sarcophagus_Now_in_Troy_Museum_7938.jpg|thumb|left|Polyxena Sarcophagus in [[Troy Museum]], named after the depiction of the sacrifice of [[Polyxena]], the last act of the Greeks at Troy.]]\n{{Further|Homeric Question|Historicity of the Iliad}}\n[[File:Troas.png|thumb|285px|Map of the Troad, including the site of Troy]]\n'''Homeric Troy''' refers primarily to the city described in the [[Iliad]], the earliest literary work in Europe. This is a long originally oral poem in its own dialect of ancient Greek in [[dactylic hexameter]], in tradition composed by a blind poet of the Anatolian Greek coast, [[Homer]]. It covers the 10th year of a war against Troy conducted by a coalition of [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]], or Greek, states under the leadership of a high king, [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]]. The city was defended by a coalition of states in the [[Dardanelles]] and West Anatolian region under another high king, [[Priam]], whose capital was Troy. The cause of the war was the elopement of Agamemnon's brother's wife, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], with [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], a prince of Troy. \n\nAfter the literary time of the poem, the city was destroyed when the Greeks pretended to leave after secreting a squad of soldiers in a gigantic [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse monument]], which the Trojans brought inside the walls.<ref group=note>In the spirit of Schliemann, which tries to match legendary events with archaeology, one theory suggests a gate modified in Troy VII (or late Troy VI) resulted from the Trojans dismantling the gate to admit the horse. {{cite book |last=A\u015fkin |first=Mustafa |title=Troy |year=1981 |publisher=Keskin |location=Istanbul |edition=2005 rev |page=[https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 34] |isbn=978-975-7559-37-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 }}</ref> In the dead of night they exited the horse and opened the gates to the Achaeans nearby. Troy was burned and the population slaughtered, although many had other fates.\n\nBesides the ''Iliad'', there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer, the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as well as in other ancient Greek literature (such as [[Aeschylus]]'s [[The Oresteia|Oresteia]]). The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''. The fall of Troy with the story of the Trojan Horse and the sacrifice of Polyxena, Priam's youngest daughter, is the subject of a later Greek epic by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] (\"Quintus of Smyrna\").\n\nThe Greeks and Romans took for a fact the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the Trojan War]] and the identity of Homeric Troy with a site in Anatolia on a peninsula called the [[Troad]] ([[Biga Peninsula]]). [[Alexander the Great]], for example, visited the site in 334&nbsp;BC and there made sacrifices at tombs associated with the Homeric heroes [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]]. In [[Piri Reis]] book ''Kitab-\u0131 Bahriye'' (Book of the Sea, 1521) which details many ports and islands of the Mediterranean, the description of the island called Tenedos mentions Troy and its ruins, lying on the shore opposite of the island.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reis|first1=Piri|title=Kitab-\u0131 Bahriye|year=2013|publisher=Boyut|isbn=9789752310513}}</ref>\n\nThe fact that the topography around the site matches the topographic detail of the poem gives to the poem a life-like quality not equaled by other epics.

There are consequently no historians from the period. Writing reappeared in the Archaic Period, after which, in the Classical Period, many historians turned their pens to record such histories of the Trojan War as had survived in oral tradition. They offer a span of about two centuries from the 1334 BC date of [[Duris of Samos]] to the 1135 BC date of Ephoros of Kyme in [[Aeolis]].

Published in his ''Voyage de la Troade'', it was the most commonly accepted theory for almost a century.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|pp=184\u2013191}}\n\nIn 1822, the Scottish journalist [[Charles Maclaren]] was the first to identify with confidence the position of the city as it is now known.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maclaren|first1=Charles|title=A Dissertation On the Topography of the Plain of Troy: Including an Examination of the Opinions of Demetrius, Chevalier, Dr. Clarke, and Major Rennell|year=1822|publisher=Bibliobazaar|isbn=978-1-146-73161-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UkkMAAAAYAAJ|access-date=28 December 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=189}}\n\n=== The Calverts ===\n[[File:Frank calvert portrait-png.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Frank Calvert, 1866, age 38. Picture was excised from a family group photograph displaying 12 persons in front of the farmhouse near Hisarlik<ref name=allen-1995-380>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=380}}</ref>]]\nFrank Calvert was born into an English [[Latin Church in Turkey|Levantine family]] on [[Malta]] in 1828. He was the youngest of six sons and one daughter born to James Calvert and his wife, the former Louisa Lander, the sister of Charles Alexander Lander, James' business partner. In social standing they were of the aristocracy. James was a distant relative of the Calverts who founded Baltimore, Maryland,<ref name=robinson153>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=153}}</ref> and Louisa was a direct descendant of the Campbells of Argyll (Scottish clansmen).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=26}}</ref> Not having inherited any wealth, they took to the colonies, married in Ottoman Smyrna in 1815, and settled in Malta, which had changed hands from the French to the [[British Empire]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. They associated with the \"privileged\" social circles of Malta, but they were poor. James clerked in the mail and grain offices of the Civil Service.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=26-31}}</ref>\n\nThe family regarded itself as a single enterprise. They shared property, assisted each other, lived together and had common interests, one of which was the antiquities of the Troad. They did not do well in Malta, but in 1829 the Dardanelles region underwent an upswing of its business cycle due to historical circumstances. The [[Greek War of Independence]] was about to be concluded in favor of an independent state by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]]. The [[Levant Company]], which had had a monopoly on trade through the Dardanelles, was terminated. The price in pounds of the Turkish piastre fell. A manyfold increase in British traffic through straits was anticipated. A new type of job suddenly appeared: British Consul in the Dardanelles, which brought wealth with it.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=32}}</ref><ref group=note>By Ottoman law every ship entering the Dardanelles from the Aegean must stop at \u00c7anakkale to acquire one or more [[firman]]s or permissions for a fee. The total bill included other fees as well. The Turkish officials did not themselves service the ships. Instead they allowed each nation to hire a resident consul or consular agent to reside in \u00c7anakkale and greet and service each ship as it came in. They were allowed to apply a schedule of consular fees in addition for this service. One individual might be an agent for more than one nation. Hard-working agents such as the Calverts grew rich on the fees, regardless of whether they were also paid a salary. Agents were not subject to Turkish law, but they might be removed if complaints of extortion or skimming the Turkish fees were made. The best and richest of the agents made themselves as charismatic as possible by living an ostentatious life, throwing parties and dinners, staging hunting expeditions, loaning money to the natives and just generally being charitable and sympathetic. Large numbers of these agents were soon found in most of the Mediterranean ports of the Ottoman Empire. It was a way to get rich quick. A recent study of these consular positions and men who filled them can be found in {{harvnb|Levantine Heritage Foundation|2013}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Lander====\nCharles Lander applied, and was made British Consul of the Dardanelles in 1829. He spoke five languages, knew the region well, and had the best connections. A row of new consular offices was being constructed in \u00c7anakkale along the shore of the strait. He was at first poor. In 1833 he bought a house in town ample enough to invite his sister's sons to join him in the enterprise. Without exception they left home at 16 to be tutored in the trade at their uncle's house and placed in lucrative consular positions. Frederick, the eldest, stayed on to assist Charles. The youngest, Frank, at school in Athens, arrived last, but his interest in archaeology led him into a different career.<ref name=robinson153/>\n\n\u00c7anakkale was a boom town. In 1831 Lander married Adele, a brief but idyllic relationship that gave them three daughters in quick succession. When the Calverts began to arrive, finding quarters in the crowded town proved to be difficult. The Turkish building code requiring buildings of wood, conflagrations were frequent.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=15}}</ref> The family escaped one fire with nothing but the clothes they were wearing.<ref>{{harvnb|Levantine Heritage Foundation|2013|p=10}}</ref> Lander's collection of books on the Troad was totally destroyed. In 1840 Lander suffered a tragedy when his wife, Adele, died in her 40's, leaving three small children. He chose this time to settle his estate, making Frederick his legal heir, guardian of his children, and co-executor (along with himself). \n\nLander dedicated himself to the consular service, leaving the details of the estate and its reponsibilites to Frederick. The family grew wealthy on the fees paid by the ships they serviced. When Frank arrived in 1845 with his sister he had nothing much to do. By this time the family had a new library. Using its books Frank explored the Troad.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=154}}</ref> He and Lander became collectors. The women in the family took a supportive role as well.\n\n====Frederick Calvert====\nLander died in 1846 of a fever endemic to the region, leaving Frederick as executor of the will and head of the family. In 1847 he assumed his uncle's consular position. He was also an agent of Lloyd's of London, which insured ship cargos. Despite Frank's youth he began to play an important role in the family consular business, especially when Frederick was away.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=17-22}}</ref> A few years prior to the death of Lander, the population of \u00c7anakkale was on the rise, from 10,000 in 1800 to 11,000 in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=157}}</ref> The British numbered about 40 families.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=16}}</ref> The increase in ship traffic meant prosperity for the Calverts, who expedited the ships of several nations, including the United States. They had other ambitions: James William Whittall, British consul in Istanbul, was spreading his doctrine of the \"Trojan Colonization Society,\" (never more than an idea) which was influential on the Calverts, whom he visited.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=99}}</ref>\n\n=====Calvert investments in the Troad=====\nIn 1847, Frederick, deciding to colonize, invested the profits of the family business in two large tracts in the Troad, amounting to many thousands of acres.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=22, 266}}</ref><ref group=note>Legally he was accessing the Lander money as trustee for the children. The properties were in his wife's name, as foreign males were not allowed to own real estate. Deeds were quitclaim.</ref> He founded a company, Calvert Bros. and Co., an \"extended family company.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=86}}</ref> The first purchase was a farm at [[Erenk\u00f6y, \u00c7anakkale|Erenk\u0151y]], 12 mi. to the SE of \u00c7anakkale. Frederick used it as a station for ships that could not make the straits. The area was a target for Greek immigration. The family became money-lenders, lending only to Greeks at rates considered high (20%).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=267}}</ref>\n\nThe station being too far from \u00c7anakkale, Calvert bought a farm he intended to work, the Batak Farm, at Ak\u00e7a K\u00f6y, 4 mi. to the southeast of Hisarlik. It harvested and marketed the cups and acorns of [[Quercus macrolepis]], the Valonia Oak, from which valonia, a compound used in dying and tanning, is extracted. The farm also raised cotton and wheat and bred horses. Frederick introduced the latest farm technology and drained the wetlands, diminishing the frequency of mosquitos and incidence of malaria, although at the time he could not have known the specific links to the \"bad air.\" The farm eventually became famous as a way station for archaeologists and the home of the Calvert collection of antiquities. The main house, featuring multiple guest bedrooms, was situated on a low ridge in a compound with several outbuildings. It was more of a manor, operated by farm workers and domestic servants.\n\nIn 1850\u20131852 Frederick solved the residence problem by having a mansion built for him in \u00c7anakkale. Two Turkish houses were said to have been put together, but Turkish houses were required to be of wood. This one was of massive stone, which was permitted to foreigners, and was placed partly on fill jetting into the straits. It probably was the length of two Turkish houses. It remained the major building of the town until it was removed in 1942, due to earlier earthquake damage. The Town Hall was then built on the site. The mansion's extensive gardens became a public park.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=382}}</ref>\n\nThe entire family of the times took up permanent residence in the mansion, which was never finished. Being well-suited for a consular residence, it was almost always occupied by visitors and social events. The Calverts began a tour-guide business, conducting visitors throughout the Troad. Frank was the chief guide. The women held musicales and sang in the salons. The house attracted a steady stream of distinguished visitors, each with a theory about the location of Troy. Frederick, however, was not there for the opening of the house. After a fall from a horse in 1851, complications forced him to seek medical care in London for 18 months,<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=267}}</ref> the first of a series of disasters that would test him subsequently. He was back by 1853. Meanwhile, young Frank had the supervision of the business.\n\n=====Crimean War debacle=====\nThe society to which Frederick returned was engaged in the beginning of the [[Crimean War]], October 1853 through February 1856. Russia had arbitrarily occupied the Danube frontier of the [[Ottoman Empire]] including the [[Crimea]], and Britain and France were providing military assistance to the Ottomans. The rear of the conflict was Istanbul and the Dardanelles. Britain relied heavily on the Levantine families for interfacing, intelligence, and guidance. Edmund Calvert was a British agent, but this was not Frederick's calling. He returned to find a British army of 10,000 men held up in ships in the straits, with no place to bivouac, no supplies, and a commissariat of four non-Turkish speakers.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=86-89}}</ref>\n\nThe British Army had reached a low point of efficiency since Wellington.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=13}}</ref> Although it was the responsibility of Parliament, the fact that the crown retained the perogative of command made them hesitate to update it, for fear of its being used against them.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=4}}</ref> One of the major problems was the fragmentation of the administration into \"a number of separate, distinct, and mutually independent authorities,\" with little centralization.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=7}}</ref> There were always devastating issues of who was in command and what they commanded. A [[Supply Corps]] as such did not exist. The immediate needs of the soldiers were supplied by the [[Commissariat|Commissariat Department]], responsible to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=12}}</ref> [[Commissary|Commissaries]] were assigned to units as needed, but they acted to solve supply problems ad hoc. They had no idea beforehand what the army needed, or what it had, or where it was located.\n\nAll the needs were contracted out. Contractors usually required money in advance. They were allowed to take out loans with recommended banks. The Commissariat then paid the banks, but should it fail to do so, the debts were still incumbent on the debtors. Contracting for the government was a high risk business. Contractors therefore were allowed to charge a percentage for their services, and also to include a percentage given to their suppliers as enticement. The Commissariat could thus build entire impromptu supply departments on the basis of immediate need, which is what Frederick did for them.<ref name=allen-1999-87-88>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=87-88}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[logistics]] problems were of the same type customarily undertaken by the consular staff, but of larger scale, Frederick was able to perform critical services for the army. Within several days he had all the men billeted ashore and had developed an organization of local suppliers on short notice. He secured their immediate attention by offering higher interest rates, to which the Commissary did not then object. He was so successful that he was given the problem of transporting men and supplies to the front.<ref group=note>The current in the Dardanelles was about 4 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], requiring a wait by sailing ships for the winds to overcome it. Troop and supply movements neeeded a more timely and predictable schedule. The Land Transport Department of the Commissary therefore undertook to develop overland trails and use horses and mules as pack animals. There were no roads or railroads. Frederick also was able to procure a few steamers to use as tugs for supply ships.</ref> For that he developed his own transport division of contractors paid as direct employees of his own company. He also advised the Medical Department in their choice of a site near Erenk\u00f6y for a military hospital.<ref name=allen-1999-87-88/>\n\nThe army, arriving at Gallipoli in April, 1854, did well at first, thanks to the efforts of Frederick Calvert and his peers. They were contracted by Deputy Assistant Commander-General of the Commissariat, John William Smith, on the instruction of the Commander-General, William Filder, who had given Smith their names in advance, especially that of Frederick Calvert. Frederick was waiting for the fleet in Gallipoli.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpin|1976|p=76}}</ref><ref group=note>The Commissary at this time was entirely civilian, accountable only to the Treasury. Its ranks were named the same as military ranks to give them credibility to the military, but there the resemblance ends. The date: March is sometimes given, but this is the date the commissaries arrived. The name: there were so many \u201cSmiths\u201d among the dignitaries that the sources confuse which was which. A common error identifies \u201cGeneral Smith\u201d with Deputy Assistant Comissary-General Charles Bagot-Smith. Lord Trevelyan, however, explicitly identifies John William as the commissary who contacted and handled Calvert and the other contractors: {{harvnb|House of Commons|1855|pp=15-17}}</ref> By June the army was doing badly. The Commissary seemed to have no understanding of military schedules. Needed supplies were not getting to their destinations for a number of reasons: perishables were spoiled through delay, cargos were lost or abandoned because there was no tracking system, or cut because a commissary speculated that they should be, etc. Frederick attempted to carry on by using his own resources in the expectation of collecting the money later by due process. By the end of the war his bill to the Commissary would be  several thousand pounds. He had had to mortgage family properties in the Troad.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=88}}</ref>\n\nBy June it was obvious to Parliament that the cabinet position of \u201cSecretary of State for War and the Colonies\u201d was beyond the ability of only one minister. He was divested of his colonial duties, leaving him as Secretary of State for War,<ref>{{harvnb|Harpin|1976|p=18}}</ref> but the Commissary was still not in his domain. In August, Frederick purchased the winter feed for the animals and left it on the dock at Salonica. Filder had adopted a policy of purchasing hay from London and having it pressing for land transport, even though chopped hay was readily available at a much cheaper price around the Dardanelles.<ref>{{harvnb|Tulloch|1857|p=144}}</ref> The Commissariat was supposed to inspect and accept it at Salonica, but the presses had been set up in the wrong location.  By the time they were ready for the hay, most of it had spoiled, so they did not accept any of it.\n\n====Frank Calvert====\nIn 1866, [[Frank Calvert]], the brother of the United States' [[Consul|consular agent]] in the region, made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium (which was on farmland owned by his family) on the same site. The hill, near the city of [[\u00c7anakkale]], was known as Hisarlik.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=42\u201344}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy, spent more than 60 years in the Troad (modern day [[Biga, \u00c7anakkale|Biga]] peninsula, Turkey) conducting field work.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=379}}.</ref> As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region, his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might have existed on the hill, and played a major role in convincing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at Hisarlik.<ref name=allen-1995-380/>\n\n=== The Schliemanns ===\n[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1878) b 713.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Heinrich Schliemann]]\nIn 1868, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate [[Hisarlik]]. He sincerely believed that the literary events of the works of Homer could be verified archaeologically. A divorced man in his 40's who had acquired some wealth as a merchant in Russia, he decided to use the wealth to follow his boyhood interest in finding and verifying the city of Troy. Leaving his former life behind, he advertised for a wife whose skills and interest were on a par with his own, Sophia. She was 17 at the time but together they excavated Troy, sparing no expense.\n\n[[File:Sophia schliemann.gif|thumb|Sophia Schliemann wearing the \"Jewels of Helen,\" a famed piece in the Priam's Treasure collection.]]\nHeinrich began by excavating a trench across the mound of Hisarlik to the depth of the settlements, today called \"Schliemann's Trench.\" In 1871\u201373 and 1878\u201379, he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the Roman period. He declared one of these cities\u2014at first Troy I, later Troy II\u2014to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time. Subsequent archaeologists at the site were to revise the date upward; nevertheless, the main identification of Troy as the city of the [[Iliad]], and the scheme of the layers, have been kept. \n\nSome of Schliemann's portable finds at Hisarlik have become known as [[Priam's Treasure]], such as the jewelry photographed displayed on Sophia. The artifacts were acquired from him by the [[Museum Island|Berlin museums]]. As Sophia matured she became an invaluable assistant to Schliemann, whom he employed especially in social situations requiring the use of modern Greek. After his death she became caretaker of his funds and publications, continuing to advocate for his beliefs. She was a respected socialite in Athens.\n\n=== Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld ===\n[[File:Doerpfeld2.jpg|thumb|100px|Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]]\n[[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] {{nowrap|(1893\u201394)}} joined the excavation at the request of Schliemann. After Schliemann left, he inherited the management of it. His chief contribution was the detailing of Troy VI. He published his findings separately.<ref>{{cite book | first=Wilhelm | last=D\u00f6rpfeld | title=Troja und Ilion | publisher=Beck & Barth | year=1902}}</ref>\n\n===University of Cincinnati===\n====Carl Blegen====\n[[File:Carl Blegen in 1922.jpg|thumb|100px|Carl Blegen]]\n[[Carl Blegen]], professor at the University of Cincinnati, managed the site 1932\u201338. These archaeologists, though following Schliemann's lead, added a professional approach not available to Schliemann. He showed that there were at least nine cities. In his research, Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy's nine levels could be further divided into forty-six sublevels,<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=259}}.</ref> which he published in his main report.</ref>{{cite book | first=Carl W. | last=Blegen | title=Troy; excavations conducted by the University of Cincinnati, 1932\u20131938 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1950}}</ref>\n\n=== Korfmann ===\nIn 1988, excavations were resumed by a team from the University of T\u00fcbingen and the [[University of Cincinnati]] under the direction of Professor [[Manfred Korfmann]], with Professor [[C. Brian Rose|Brian Rose]] overseeing Post-Bronze Age (Greek, Roman, Byzantine) excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy. Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire-damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC. The question of Troy's status in the Bronze-Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the T\u00fcbingen historian [[Frank Kolb]] in 2001\u20132002.\n\nKorfmann proposed that the location of the city (close to the [[Dardanelles]]) indicated a commercially oriented city that would have been at the center of a vibrant trade between the Black Sea, Aegean, Anatolian and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Kolb disputed this thesis, calling it \"unfounded\" in a 2004 paper. He argues that archaeological evidence shows that economic trade during the [[Late Bronze Age]] was quite limited in the Aegean region compared with later periods in antiquity. On the other hand, the Eastern Mediterranean economy was more active during this time, allowing for commercial cities to develop only in the [[Levant]]. Kolb also noted the lack of evidence for trade with the [[Hittite Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kolb |first1= F.|date=2004 |title=Forum Article: Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City? |url= |journal=American Journal of Archaeology American Journal of Archaeology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 577\u2013613|doi= 10.3764/aja.108.4.577|jstor=40025731}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1993, following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort, a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city. Remains found in the ditch were dated to the late Bronze Age, the alleged time of Homeric Troy. Among these remains are arrowheads and charred remains.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ten Discoveries That Rewrote History|last=Hunt|first=Patrick|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Modern Excavations at Troy Continue to Show Its Importance}}</ref> It is claimed by Korfmann that the ditch may have once marked the outer defenses of a much larger city than had previously been suspected. In the olive groves surrounding the citadel, there are portions of land that were difficult to plow, suggesting that there are undiscovered portions of the city lying there. The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250&nbsp;BC, and it has been also suggested\u2014based on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann's team\u2014that this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy.\n\n=== Becker ===\n[[Helmut Becker]] utilized magnetometry in the area surrounding Hisarlik. He was conducting an excavation in 1992 to locate outer walls of the ancient city. Becker used a caesium magnetometer. In his and his team's search, they discovered a \"'burnt mudbrick wall' about 400 metres south of the Troy VI fortress wall.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Troy and Homer: Towards a Solution of an Old Mystery|last=Latacz|first=Joachim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> After dating their find, it was deemed to have been from the late Bronze Age, which would put it either in Troy VI or early Troy VII. This discovery of an outer wall away from the tell proves that Troy could have housed many more inhabitants than Schliemann originally thought.\n\n=== Recent developments ===\nIn summer 2006, the excavations continued under the direction of Korfmann's colleague Ernst Pernicka, with a new digging permit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de//uni/aft/|title=Project Troia|publisher=[[University of T\u00fcbingen]], [[University of Cincinnati]]|access-date=6 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526125407/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/aft/|archivedate=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an international team made up of cross-disciplinary experts led by William Aylward, an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was to carry out new excavations.

Most are outdoors, but a permanent canopy covers the site of an early megaron and wall.\n\n== Troy as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\nThe archaeological site of Troy was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.\n\nFor a site to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it must be claimed to have Outstanding Universal Value. This means that it must be historically, culturally, or scientifically significant to all peoples of the world in some manner. According to the UNESCO site on Troy, its historical significance was gained because the site displays some of the \"first contact between...Anatolia and the Mediterranean world\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/|title=Archaeological Site of Troy|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The site's cultural significance is gained from the multitudes of literature regarding the famed city and history over centuries. Many of the structures dating to the Bronze Age and the Roman and Greek periods are still standing at Hisarlik. These give archeological significance to the site as well. \n\nMore information on the UNESCO qualifications of Troy can be found on the [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/ UNESCO website].\n\n== Troy Museum ==\n{{main|Troy Museum}}\n[[File:Troy_Museum_9919.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Troy Museum subterranean interior.]]\n[[File:Troy Museum 9913.jpg|thumb|220px|Troy Museum aboveground.

A design contest for the architecture had been won by Yalin Mimarlik in 2011. The cube-shaped building with extensive underground galleries holds more than 40,000 portable artifacts, 2000 of which are on display. Artifacts were moved here from a few other former museums in the region. The range is the entire prehistoric Troad. Displays are multi-lingual. In many cases the original contexts are reproduced.\n\n== Priam's Treasure ==\n{{main|Priam's Treasure}}\n[[File:Priam's treasure.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Priam's Treasure]], which [[Heinrich Schliemann]] claimed to have found at Troy]]\nSome of the most notable artifacts uncovered at Hisarlik are known as [[Priam's Treasure]]. Most of these pieces were crafted from gold and other precious metals. Heinrich Schliemann put this assemblage together from his first excavation site, which he thought to be the remains of Homeric Troy. He gave them this name after King Priam, who is said in the ancient literature to have ruled during the Trojan War. However, the site that housed the treasure was later identified as Troy II, whereas Priam's Troy would most likely have been Troy VIIa (Blegen) or Troy VIi (Korfmann).<ref name=seven group=note/> One of the most famous photographs of Sophia made not long after the discovery depicts her wearing a golden headdress, which is known as the \"Jewels of Helen\" (see under Schliemann above).\n\nOther pieces that are a part of this collection are:\n\n* copper artifacts - a shield, cauldron, axeheads, lance heads, daggers, etc.\n* silver artifacts - vases, goblets, knife blades, etc.\n* gold artifacts - bottle, cups, rings, buttons, bracelets, etc.\n* terra cotta goblets\n* artifacts with a combination of precious metals\n\nMore information on these treasures can be found on the [[Priam's Treasure]] site.\n\n== Fortifications of the city ==\n[[File:Troy (Ilion), Turkey (7446656654).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Artist's representation of House VI M, part of the palatial complex]]\nLiterary Troy was characterized by high walls and towers, summarized by the epithet \"lofty Ilium.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Ilium | editor=William Smith | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | year=2020 | origyear=1854 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DI%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dilium-geo}}</ref> Some other epithets were \"well-walled,\" \"with lofty gates,\" \"with fine towers.\"<ref>Blegen's study of the Homeric epithets bearing on the architecture of Troy may be found at {{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=16}}</ref> Any archaeological candidate for being the literary city would therefore have to show evidence for the walls and towers.

Whether Troy Zero featured walls is not yet known. Some of the known walls were placed on virgin soil (see the archaeology section below). The early date of the walls suggests that defense was important and warfare was a looming possibility right from the beginning.\n\nThe walls surround the citadel, extending for several hundred meters, and at the time they were built were over {{convert|17|feet|m|lk=on}} tall.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|last=the Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=November 22, 2016|website=|access-date=}}</ref> They were made of limestone, with watchtowers and brick ramparts, or elevated mounds that served as protective barriers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second run of excavations, under Korfmann, revealed that the walls of the first run were not the entire suite of walls for the city, and only partially represent the citadel. According to Korfmann, \"There was also a lower city that went with the Late Bronze Age Troja,...1750-1200 BCE.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=29}}</ref> This city had a perimeter 0f {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} end enclosed an area 16 times that of the citadel.

Exposed rock displays layers of a similar composition and fossil content within a layer discontinuous with other layers above and below it. The layer represents an accumulation of detritus over a continuous time, different from the times of the other layers.\n\nSimilarly Schliemann found layers of distinctive soil each containing more or less distinctive artifacts differing often markedly from other layers. He had no ready explanation for the discontinuity between layers, such as \"destruction,\" although this interpretation has sometimes been applied. Presumably \"destruction\" is to be interpreted to mean some sort of malicious event perpetrated by humans or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. In most cases no such disaster can be proved. On the contrary, the \"many layers illustrate the gradual development of civilization in northwestern Asia Minor.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref group=note>The view presented by Encyclopedia Britannica is self-contradictory, the reason being that different sources place different interpretations on archaeological layering. To some, layers represent new peoples sweeping in and destroying the old population centers, to place their own settlements there. Such dramatic events do sometimes happen. Archaeologists of the late 19th and early 20th century tended to adopt this \"invasion\" view, but later it became evident that in most cases invasions were mainly speculative. The evidence usually supported no such thing. The tendency today is to look for slow transitions from one culture to another in the same region. Other statements in the Britannica article support this view. The best example is \"the search for Troy;\" that is, the long effort to identify any evidence of the historical destruction of Troy. If this most obvious question cannot be settled, then destructions for every layer are less likely.</ref>\n\nThe discontinuities of culture in different layers might be explained in a number of ways. A settlement might have been abandoned for peaceful reasons, or it might have undergone a renovation phase. These are hypotheses that must be ruled in or ruled out by evidence, or simply be left unruled until evidence should be discovered.\n\nWhat Schliemann found is that the area now called \"the citadel\" or \"the upper city\" was apparently placed on virgin soil. It was protected by fortifications right from the start. The layering effect was caused in part by the placement of new fortifications and new houses over the old. Schliemann called these fortified enclosures \"cities\" (rightly or wrongly). In his mind the site was composed of successive cities. Like everyone else, he speculated whether a new city represented a different population, and what its relationship to the old was. He numbered the cities I, II, etc., I being on the bottom. Subsequent archaeologists turned the \"cities\" into layers (rightly or wrongly), named according to the new archaeological naming conventions then being developed. \nThe layers of ruins in the citadel at [[Hisarlik]] are numbered Troy I{{spaced ndash}}Troy IX, with various subdivisions.\n\n{{side box | above='''The Layers of Troy''' | image=[[File:Layers of Troy.JPG|thumb|350px|center|In this photograph, depicting \"the Schliemann trench,\" different layers have been identified by sign for the convenience of the visitors.]]}}\n\nUntil the late 20th century, these layers represented only the layers on the hill of Hisarlik. Archaeologists following Schliemann picked up the trail of his researches adopting the same fundamental assumptions, culminating in the work and writings of [[Carl Blegen]] in the mid-20th century. In a definitive work, ''Troy and the Trojans'', he summarized the layers names and the dates he had adopted for them.<ref name=bleg174>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=174}}</ref> Without further excavation, Blegen's was the last word. There were, however, some persistent criticisms not answered to general satisfaction. Hisarlik, about the size of a football field, was not large enough to have been the mighty city of history. It was also far inland, yet the general historical tradition suggested it must have been close to the sea.\n\nThe issues finally devolved on the necessity for further excavation, which was undertaken by Korfmann starting 1988. He concentrated on the Roman city, which was not suspected as being over Bronze Age remains. A Bronze Age city, at low elevations, was discovered beneath it. As it is unlikely that there were two Troys side by side, the lower city must have been the main seat of residence, to which the upper city served as citadel. Korfman now referred to the layers of the lower city as associated with the layers of the citadel. The same layering scheme was applicable. The lower city was many times the size of the citadel, answering the size objection. \n\n[[File:Troja-Blick-Schliemanngraben.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The view from Schliemann's Trench at Hisarl\u0131k across the modern plain of Ilium to the [[Aegean Sea]]. The suburbs of \u00c7anakkale are visible in the distance. During the early Troy periods, nearly this entire plain was an inlet of the sea.]]\nMeanwhile independent geoarchaeological research conducted by taking ground cores over a wide area of the Troad were demonstrating that, in the time of Troy I, \"... the sea was right at the foot of 'Schliemann's Trench' during the earliest periods of Troja.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kayan|2003|p=394}}</ref> A few thousand years earlier the ridge of Troy was partly surrounded by an inlet of the sea occupying the now agricultural area of the lower Scamander River. Troy was founded as an apparently maritime city on the shore of this inlet, which persisted throughout the early layers and was present to a lesser degree, farther away, subsequently. The harbor at Troy, however, was always small, shallow, and partially blocked by wetlands. It was never a \"great harbor\" able to collect maritime traffic through the Dardanelles.<ref>{{harvnb|Kayan|2003|pp=400-401}}</ref> The current water table depends on the degree of irrigation of the now agricultural lands. Trench flooding has slowed investigation of the lower levels in the lower city.\n\nThe whole course of archaeological investigation at Troy has resulted in no single chronological table of layers. Moreover, due to limitations on the accuracy of C<sub>14</sub> dating, the tables remain relative; i.e., absolute, or calendar dates, cannot be precisely assigned. In regions of the Earth where both history and C<sub>14</sub> dating are available, there is often a gap between them, termed by Renfrew a chronological or archaeological \"fault line.\" The two models, historical and archaeological, do not correspond, just as the contexts on either side of a geologic fault line do not correspond. \"This line divides all Europe except the Aegean from the Near East.\"<ref>{{cite journal | first=Jak | last=Yakar | title=Troy and Anatolia Early Bronze Age Chronology | journal=Anatolian Studies | volume=29 | year=1979 | page=52| doi=10.2307/3642730 | jstor=3642730 }}</ref> \n\n=== Table of layers ===\n[[File:Section Troy-Hisarlik-de.svg|thumb|300px|left|Representation of a cross-section of the mound of Hisarlik showing the relationship between the fortifications and the layers.]]\nThe table below concentrates on two systems of dates: Blegen's from ''Troy and the Trojans'',<ref name=bleg174/><ref group=note>The table only covers the Bronze Age.

Korfmann reproduces a table by Justus Cobet in ''[[Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|Neuer Pauly]]'' purporting to compare the chronologies of Schliemann, D\u0151rpfeld, Blegen and himself, with a statement of the general periods. One limitation of the table is that its dates do not recognize the changing views of those archaeologists; Korfmann himself in the text presents additional material. This article only relies on the Korfmann column of Cobet's table; Blegen's latest chronology is from another source.</ref> \n\nPrior to Korfmann's excavations, the nine-layer model was considered comprehensive of all the material at Troy. Korfmann discovered that the city was not placed on virgin soil, as Schliemann had concluded. There is no reason not to think that, in the areas he tested, Schliemann did find that Troy I was on virgin soil. Korfmann discovered a layer previous to Troy I under a gate to Troy II. He dated it 3500 BC to 2920 BC, but did not assign a name. The current director of excavation at Troy, R\u00fcstem Aslan, is calling it Troy 0 (zero).<ref>{{cite web | title=Ancient city of Troy likely founded 600 years earlier than thought | website=Daily Sabah History | location=Istanbul | date=9 January 2019 | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2019/08/21/ancient-city-of-troy-likely-founded-600-years-earlier-than-thought}}</ref> Roman numerals have no zero, but zero is one number less than I. \n\nTroy 0 has been omitted from the table below, due to the uncertainty of its general status. Archaeologists at the site before Korfmann had thought that Troy I began with the Bronze Age at 3000 BC. Troy zero is before this date. The remains of the layer are not very substantial. Whether the layer is to be counted as part of the preceding Chalcolithic, or whether the dates of the Bronze Age are to be changed, has not been decided through the regular channel of journal articles. One 2016 PhD Thesis complained: \"... the stratigraphic sequence of the renewed excavations is presented differently by different collaborators of Korfmann ... So, until an agreed stratigraphy of Korfmann\u2019s cycle is published, the employment of Troy as a yardstick for the whole of the Anatolian EBA remains problematic.\"<ref>{{cite thesis | last=Massa |first=Michele  | year=2016 |title=Networks before Empires: cultural transfers in west and central Anatolia during the Early Bronze Age |type=PhD | location=London| publisher=Institute of Archaeology University College |url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1478344/43/Massa_Thesis_combined.pdf |access-date=23 January 2020 | page=37 }}</ref><ref group=note>Not long after the beginning of the new excavations, Rose, anticipating that the dates were going to change, published some new chronological boundaries for Troy VIII-IX: {{cite book | first=C.B. | last=Rose | chapter=The 1991 Post-Bronze Age excavations at Troia | title=Studia Troica | volume=2 | year=1992 | page=44 n. 16}} This article prefers the dates published by Korfmann after his excavations had had more of a chance to mature. Unforunately a final solidification and publication was prevented by his untimely death of natural causes.</ref>\n\nFor example, in {{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=31}} Korfmann elaborates beyond the chronology of Cobet's table to make new proposals regarding the layer, Troy VIIa (which he also presents in the ''Guidebook''): \"Troia VIIa should be assigned culturally to\nTroia VI,\" asserting that \"there were no substantial differences in the material culture between the two periods.\" He suggests that D\u0151rpfeld's classification of the material subsequently in VIIa as VIi should be restored, claiming that, regarding the details, Blegen had been \"entirely in agreement\" even though his chronology featured Troy VIIa.<ref name=seven group=note>Korfmann's interpreation of the archaeological events is \"At the\nend of VIi there is a break, probably caused by war, followed by VIj \u2013 a brief phase\nin ruins. Then again a break shows up, this time a more pronounced one, with\nVIIb2, caused by people who evidently came from the north-eastern Balkans.\" This view implicitly leaves room for the 10th year of the Trojan War and the arrival of the Phrygians, or proto-Armenians, who were shortly to overrun Anatolia, displacing the Hittites.</ref> He then laments \"the old terminology has, unfortunately, been retained. Confusion is to be avoided at all costs.\" As this view has not yet been tested in the journals and is not universal, it is mainly omitted from the table (Cobet's chart, however, includes Korfmann's VIIb 3.) This new and yet unresolved material, including Troy Zero, may, however, be included in the sections and links below reporting on specific layers\n\nKorfmann also found that Troy IX was not the end of the settlements. Regardless of whether the city was abandoned at 450 AD, a population was back for the Middle Ages, which, for those times, was under the Byzantine Empire. As with Troy Zero, no conventional scholarly classification has been tested in the journals. The literature mentions Troy X, and even Troy XI, without solid definition. The table below therefore omits them.\n\nThe sequence of archaeological layering at one site evidences the relative positions of the corresponding periods at that site; however, these layers often have a position relative to periods at other sites. It is possible to define relative periods over a wide region of sites and for a larger slice of time. Determining wider correspondences is a major objective of archaeology. The establishment of a \"yardstick,\" or reliable sequence, such as the elusive one mentioned above, is a desirable outcome of archaeological analysis.\n\nThe table below states the broader connections under \"General Period.\" It references primarily the chronologies presented in the educational site created and maintained by Jeremy Rutter and team and published by [[Dartmouth College]], entitled ''Aegean Prehistoric Archaeology''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Rutter | first=Jeremy | title=The Chronology and Terminology of Aegean Prehistory | website=Chronology Overview | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=67 | accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref><ref group=note>The term \"Aegean\" has been used in recent times to mean the set of correlatable sites found in the Eastern and Central Mediterranean regions, which influenced each other through contacts established in and around the [[Aegean Sea]].

Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate, a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos.<ref>{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=75}}</ref> This gate, as he describes, was the gate that Homer had featured. As Schliemann states in his publication ''Troja'':\n\"I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city, destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe, which had on the hill of Hisarl\u0131k only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices, southerly, and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium; and that, consequently, this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=277}}</ref>Also, he uncovered what he referred to as The Palace of Priam, after the king during the Trojan War.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Troy and Its Remains|last=Schliemann|first=Heinrich|publisher=Benjamin Blom, Inc.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This reference is incorrect because Priam lived nearly a thousand years after Troy II.\n\n=== Troy VI and VII ===\n[[File:Ajax suicide BM F480.jpg|thumb|The suicide of Ajax (from a [[krater|calyx-krater]], 400\u2013350 BC, [[Vulci]])]]\n\n{{Main|Troy VII}}\nTroy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC, probably by an [[earthquake]].

This pottery suggests that during Troy IV, the Trojans still had trade with the Greeks and the Aegean. Furthermore, there were cremation burials discovered 400m south of the citadel wall. This provided evidence of a small lower city south of the Hellenistic city walls. Although the size of this city is unknown due to erosion and regular building activities, there is significant evidence that was uncovered by Blegen in 1953 during an excavation of the site. This evidence included settlements just above bedrock and a ditch thought to be used for defense. Furthermore, the small settlement itself, south of the wall, could have also been used as an obstacle to defend the main city walls and the citadel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Easton|first=D.F.|last2=Hawkins|first2=J.D.|last3=Sherratt|first3=A.G.|last4=Sherratt|first4=E.S.|date=December 2002|title=Troy in recent perspective|journal=Anatolian Studies|volume=52|pages=75\u2013109|doi=10.2307/3643078|issn=0066-1546|jstor=3643078}}</ref>\n\nThe topic still under debate is whether Troy was primarily an Anatolian-oriented or Aegean-oriented metropolis. While it is true that the city would have had a presence in the Aegean,  pottery finds and architecture strongly hint at an Anatolian orientation. Only about one percent of the pottery discovered during excavation of Troy VI was Mycenaean. The large walls and gates of the city are closely related to many other Anatolian designs. Furthermore, the practice of cremation is Anatolian. Cremation is never seen in the Mycenaean world. Anatolian hieroglyphic writing along with bronze seals marked with Anatolian hieroglyphic Luwian were also uncovered in 1995. These seals have been seen in approximately 20 other Anatolian and Syrian cities from the time (1280 - 1175 BC).<ref name=\"Korfmann 1998 369\">{{Cite journal|last=Korfmann|first=Manfred|date=1998|title=Troia, an Ancient Anatolian Palatial and Trading Center: Archaeological Evidence for the Period of Troia VI/VII|journal=The Classical World|volume=91|issue=5|pages=369\u2013385|doi=10.2307/4352105|issn=0009-8418|jstor=4352105}}</ref>\n\nStill, Troy VI was dominated by long distance trade. Troy VI during the height of its establishment held anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people. At its time, Troy would have been a large and significant city.<ref name=\"Korfmann 1998 369\"/> The location of Troy was extremely practical in the Early Bronze Age (2000\u20131500 BC). It acted as a middle ground for long distance trade with regions as far distant as Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic region, Egypt, and the western Mediterranean in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.  Earlier trade connections during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages provided Troy VI with favorable power in the long distance trade industry of the region. The amount of objects thought to be going through Troy VI would have been quite large, obtaining metals from the east and various objects from the west including perfumes and oils. This is known due to the findings of hundreds of shipwrecks off the Turkish coast. Found in these ships was an abundance of goods. Some of these ships carried over 15 tons in goods. The goods discovered in these wrecks included copper ingots, tin ingots, glass ingots, bronze tools and weapons, ebony and ivory, ostrich egg shells, jewelry and large amounts of pottery from across the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Kolb 577\u2013613\">{{Cite journal|last=Kolb|first=Frank|date=October 2004|title=Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City?|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=108|issue=4|pages=577\u2013613|doi=10.3764/aja.108.4.577|issn=0002-9114}}</ref> &nbsp;\n\nThere have been 210 shipwrecks discovered in the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age. Of these 210, 63 were discovered off the Turkish coastline. This provides a great deal of evidence for Troy VI being a prominent trading center for the region. But, the evidence at the site of Troy itself is minimal. Looking at the layers of Troy VI, we discover that there is little documentation of the excavation of this layer, and little documentation of the goods discovered in this layer. We also know that there were few trading centers during the Late Bronze Age. This is due to the low volume of trade during this period. The trading centers would have most likely been directly along trade routes. Troy is just north of most major long-distance trade routes. It may be unfair to classify Troy VI as a trading center but we do know that Troy VI was a prominent metropolis that did contribute to the trade of the region.<ref name=\"Kolb 577\u2013613\"/>\n\nTroy VIIa can be highlighted by most of the population of Troy moving within the walls of the Citadel.

It was not until the need to close \"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" arose\u2014from D\u00f6rpfeld's discovery of Troy VI\u2014that archaeology turned away from Schliemann's Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=142}}.</ref>\n\n\"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" (1800\u2013800 BC) was a period not accounted for by Schliemann's archaeology and thus constituted a hole in the Trojan timeline. In Homer's description of the city, a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest.<ref>Homer. \"Iliad\". XVI,</ref> During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall, D\u00f6rpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=89}}.</ref> D\u00f6rpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer's city, and now he would excavate the city itself. Within the walls of this stratum (Troy VI), much [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] pottery dating from [[Late Helladic]] (LH) periods III A and III B (c. 1400\u2013c. 1200 BC) was uncovered, suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans. The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the \"Great Tower of Ilios\".<ref>Homer. \"Iliad\". VI, 386</ref>\n\nThe evidence seemed to indicate that D\u00f6rpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios, the city of Homer's epics. Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city, but he never published anything stating so.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=143}}.</ref> The only counter-argument, confirmed initially by D\u00f6rpfeld (who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy), was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake, not by men.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=228}}.</ref> There was little doubt that this was the Troy of which the Mycenaeans would have known.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=223}}.</ref>\n\n== Historical Troy ==\nThe archaeologists of Troy concerned themselves mainly with [[prehistory]]; however, not all the archaeology performed there falls into the category of [[prehistoric archaeology]]. Troy VIII and Troy IX are dated to historical periods. [[Historical archaeology]] illuminates [[history]]. In the LBA records mentioning Troy begin to appear in other cultures. This type of evidence is termed [[protohistory]]. The literary characters and events must be classified as [[legend|legendary]]. Prehistoric Troy is also legendary Troy. The legends are not history or protohistory, as they are not records. It was the question of their historicity that attracted the interest of such archaeologists as Calvert and Schliemann. After many decades of archaeology, there are still no answers. There is still a \"fault line\" between history or legend and archaeology.\n\n=== Troy in Late Bronze Age Hittite and Egyptian records ===\nIf Homeric Troy is not a fantasy woven in the 8th century by Greek oral poets passing on a tradition of innovating new poems at festivals, as most archaeologists hoped it was not, then the question must be asked, what archaeological level represents Homeric Troy? Only two credible answers are available, which are the same answer: Troy VIIa in the Blegen scheme,<ref>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=164}}</ref> identical to Troy VIi in the scheme suggested by Korfmann.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=110}}</ref> After an earthquake brought down the walls of the city at its floruit about 1300 BC, the same people rebuilt the city even more magnificent than before. This event is considered the start of the LBA, and Homeric Troy is considered to be LBA Troy.\n\nBoth Blegen and Korfmann endorse a starting date of about 1300 BC. Blegen has it ending early at 1260 BC,<ref group=note>Before Korfmann began excavation again at Troy there was a movement to bring the date of the war up to 1100 BC by postulating that it happened at the end of Troy VIIb2: {{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=25-26|loc=Sinclair Hood, \"The Bronze Age Context of Homer\"}}. As justification, correlations were made to LHIIIC pottery at Pylos, rather than to the LHIIIB pottery Blegen had assumed was synchronous. Korfmann, however, found Balkan-type pottery in VIIb, suggesting an occupation by people from the Balkans. He changed the end date of VIIa to the end of the century and then decided to go back to D\u00f6rpfeld's late Troy VI.</ref> but Korfmann runs it up to 1190 BC (or 1180 BC elsewhere). He abolishes VIIa, and substitutes for it VIi, more in keeping with the splendor of VI; after all, they were the same people. He estimates the population at 10,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|pp=59-60}}</ref> The end of the period is marked by weapons left laying around, skeletons, and burnt objects, considered the result of the Trojan War. Coincidentally this is the very period referenced by Egyptian and Hittite records of Troy. They hold out some hope of a protohistorical connection.\n\nIn the 1920s, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scholar [[Emil Forrer]] proposed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=34\u201335|loc=Mellink, \"Homer, Lycia, and Lukka\"}}</ref> He further noted that the name of [[Alaksandu]], a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty, is quite similar to Homer's [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], whose birthname was Alexandros. These identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable. However, [[Trevor Bryce]] championed them in his 1998 book ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'', citing a piece of the [[Manapa-Tarhunda letter]] referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River (the classical [[Caicus]] and modern [[Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay]]) and near the land of \"Lazpa\" ([[Lesbos]]). \n\nThe excavation of the lower city uncovered a water distribution system containing {{convert|160|m|ft}} of tunnels tapping sources higher up on the ridge. Dates from the floor deposits obtained by the [[Uranium-thorium dating]] method indicate that water was flowing through the tunnels \"as early as the third millenium BC;\" thus the early city made sure that it had an internal water supply.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=112}}</ref> In 1280 BC a treaty between the reigning monarchs of the Hittite and Trojan states, Muwatalli II and Alaksandu of Wilusa respectively, invoked the water god, KASKAL_KUR, who was associated with an underground tunnel, adding weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy.\n \nAmong the documents mentioning Troy are the [[Tawagalawa letter]] ([[Catalogue des Textes Hittites|CTH]] 181) was found to document an unnamed Hittite king's correspondence to the king of the [[Ahhiyawa]], referring to an earlier \"Wilusa episode\" involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa. The Hittite king was long held to be [[Mursili II]] (c.&nbsp;1321\u20131296), but, since the 1980s, his son [[Hattusili III]] (1265\u20131240) is commonly preferred, although his other son [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] (c.&nbsp;1296\u20131272) remains a possibility.\n\nInscriptions of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] also record a nation T-R-S as one of the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|XX Dynasties]]. An inscription at [[Deir el-Medina]] records a victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the Sea Peoples, including one named \"Tursha\" (Egyptian: [''twr\u01613'']). It is probably the same as the earlier \"Teresh\" (Egyptian: [''tr\u0161.w'']) on the [[Merneptah Stele|stele]] commemorating [[Merneptah]]'s victory in a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] campaign around 1220&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer's [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion. That agrees with [[Metrical foot|metrical]] evidence in the [[Iliad]] that the name \u1fbd\u0399\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Ilion) for Troy was formerly \u03dc\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Wilion) with a [[digamma]].<ref name=met group=note>\"Metrical evidence\" is a specialized term from the study of Greek poetry. Where English poetry constructs its metric feet from emphasized and unemphasized syllables:\"Listen my children and you shall hear ...,\" ancient Greek uses long and short syllables, the length being determined according to the sequence of long and short vowels and clusters of consonants. Homer wrote his poetry in dactylic hexameter: \"Menin aeide thea ....\" From the fact that some syllables are treated as long when they should be short leads the linguists to conclude that an initial \"w\" was dropped at some time after composition: Ilion for former Wilion.</ref>\n\n=== The language culture of Troy ===\nFrom the beginning of the archaeology, the question of what language was spoken by the Trojans was prominent. Various proposals were made, but they remained pure speculation. No evidence seemed to have survived whatever. That they might be Greek was considered. However, if they were, the question of why they were not in the Achaean domain, but were opposed to the Achaeans. was an even greater mystery. Passages from the ''Iliad'' suggested that, not only were the Trojans not Greek, but the army defending Troy was composed of different language speakers arrayed by nationality.<ref>{{harvnb|Watkins|1986|pp=51-52}}. They did not speak the same language, based on ''Iliad'' II 803-804 and IV 437-438. In IV 433-435 they seem to the Greeks like a flock of bleating sheep. Hektor's battle cry was \"Trojans, Lykians, and Dardanians!\" Watkins adds, \"The epic convention is, of course, that the Trojans spoke Greek....\"</ref>\n\nFinally in the middle of the 20th century [[Linear B]] was deciphered and a large number of documentary tablets were able to be read. The language is an early dialect of Greek, even earlier than the Homeric dialect. Many Greek words were in the early stage of formation. The digamma abounds. Linear B tablets have been found at the major centers of the Achaean domain. None, however, come from Troy. \n\nThe documents in Linear B basically inventory the assets of Mycenaean palace-states: foods, textiles, ceramics, weapons, lands, and above all manpower, especially people held in some sort of servitude. Civilizations of the times were slave societies. The terms of servitude, however, varied widely. A study by Efkleidou in 2004 detailed the types of servitude mentioned in the Linear B tablets. To her way of thinking, the main elements of servitude are that servants are outsiders, not part of the customary social structure, and that they are coerced into their positions. Someone has authority over them, whom she calls a \"superior,\" designated in Greek by the genitive case: \"servant of ....\" One of the categories of Mycenaean servant is the do-er-o (masc) and do-er-a (fem), Greek doulos, pl douloi, and doula, pl doulai.<ref>{{harvnb|Efkleidou|2004|pp=59-62}}</ref> A specific type of doulos is the te-o-jo do-er-o, theoio doulos, \"servant of God,\" a temple assistant of some sort, whose superior was the deity. These two categories were not badly off, being palace artisans, and receiving land for their services. In addition were the ra-wi-ja-ja, the lawiaiai, \"captives.\" These were kept in groups and performed what would be termed today \"factory work.\" The tablets, being ephemeral in nature, do not always classify these types, but they are detectable from the naming conventions, or lack of them, and the type of work. Efkleidou uses the term \"dependent.\" In all she tallied 5233 dependents in the tablets.\n\nPerhaps most relevant to the times are named groups of women, the group name being an ethnic or a craft name. One such group called just \"captives\" gives a hint to their class of servitude. The ethnic names show that western Anatolia and the islands off it are being favored.<ref group=note>The relevant groups are: 7 women from [[Lemnos]] (ra-mi-ni-ja), 6 or 7 from Chios (ki-si-wi-je), 35 from Asia (a-*64-ja), 26 from the vicinity of [[Halicarnassus]] (ze-ru2-ra3), 70 from Miletus (mi-ra-ti-ja).</ref> Other groups implicitly from the region are named after the type of work they do, especially the textile workers: finishers, spinners, and a group of flax handlers (ri-ne-ja, or lineiai) composed of 82 women with 61 female children and 56 male. Other groups are male bronzesmiths, house and ship builders.<ref>{{harvnb|Efkleidou|2004|pp=104-119}}</ref>  The majority of the females were textile workers, a development foreshadowed in the initial scene of the ''Iliad'', in which the priest, Chryses, entreats Agamemnon to ransom his daughter, Chryseis, only to be refused with the statement that she would be frequenting his bed and working his loom far away in Argos.\n\nIn the tablets, the coast of Anatolia is under attack by Mycenaean centers of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], especially the center at [[Pylos]] (pu-ro). Since the tablets, which were manufactured ad hoc of fresh clay and immediately engraved with writing, only survived by being baked in the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|fires that destroyed the palaces]], their dates depend on the those dates of destruction. The Pylos tablets record the dispatch of a fleet of \"rowers\" and soldiers under a \"commander\" to the [[Gulf of Corinth]], and then the palace is gone, burned in its own oil. If pu-ro is the Homeric Pylos, then the date is after the Trojan War, as the legendary Pylos survived it intact. None of the names of the important men at these centers are anything like the names of the Homeric legends. Presumably, the latter had all died in their time and had been replaced by men unknown to legend, but profiting from the fall of Troy. A second possibility would be that the legends are totally imaginary, contrary to the hopes and expectations of the first archaeologists.\n\nThis time between the Trojan War and the burning of the palaces fits into another historical period, the time of the [[Sea Peoples]]. These were ethnicities from Achaea, Dardania, Etruria, Sicilia, Sardinia, and elsewhere, who, abandoning the norms of civilization, took to a life of marauding and piracy, disrupting trade, transportation, peace, and security. They placed colonies as bases.<ref group=note>The earliest historical view is that these people were transitioning from somewhere else to their classical locations, pushed by the southward movement of Balkan peoples. The main problem with the theory is that the \"somewhere else\"s were not locateable. The classification of many of them as archaeologically indigenous to their known native lands reduced their appearances in the Mediterranean to mere opportunistic expeditions.</ref> The eastern Mediterranean became a wilderness. Cities withdrew from the coast. Isolation set in.\n\nSurprisingly, Trojan names began turning up in the archives of ancient Pylos, capital of the legendary [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]. They were of persons kept in a servile capacity, from which the universal conclusion was that they were descended from slaves taken at Troy. Etymological analysis by linguists revealed that they were not native Greek names, suggesting that the Trojans were not Greek.\n\nA theory began to gain influence based on the [[Aeneid]] that the Trojans were Etruscan.<ref group=note>Statements of ancient authors on the origin of the Etruscans are contradictory. [[Herodotus]] stated that, under the name [[Tyrrhenians|Tursenoi]], they came from [[Lydia]]. Equating Tursenoi with Trojan, early scholars of the Etruscans presumed that, regardless of what language was spoken at Troy, Aeneas represented an Etruscan component. Aeneas, however, landed in Latium, whereas the Etruscans dwelled in Tuscany, North Italy, and northeast Italy. It was necessary to hypothesize a priori that Etruscan civilization spread from Latium to the rest of its range. This point of view has been called \"the Herodotean.\" The discovery that Lydian is Anatolian dampened the theory somewhat but hold-outs insist on a backland between the Hittites and coastal Luwians where such a pocket could exist, no matter how small the numbers.</ref> This theory purported to explain how the Etruscans arrived in Italy. During the 20th century, however, Etruscan archaeology investigated thousands of Etruscan sites over most of Italy, except for the Greek regions in south Italy and the Italic regions of central Italy. Moreover, Etruscan inscriptions were found in at least one valley leading to a pass over the Alps. The sites dated as early as the Bronze Age. It was soon clear that the theory of a general Etruscan migration from Troy to most of Italy was the least likely scenario.<ref group=note>Italian archaeologists were the first major group of scholars to reject the Herodotean view. Etruscan civilzation, they said, was indigenous to Italy, from which it spread to colonies in the Mediterranean as part of its merchant activities. The Italian point of view can be found in {{cite thesis |last=Forte |first=Valeria | date=December 2008 | title=Archaeology and Nationalism: The Trojan Legend in Etruria  | type=MA | chapter=4.3 Etruscan Origins: Discrepancies in Texts | publisher=The University of Texas at Arlington | chapter-url=https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/1819/Forte_uta_2502M_10074.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y | access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> The Etruscan theory died slowly. Its advocates looked for hidden pockets of Etruscans in the backlands of Anatolia and looked for hope in some shallow genetic studies purporting to relate the inhabitants of Tuscany to the inhabitants of Turkey.<ref group=note>In the early 21st century attempts were made to gauge the relatedness of modern Tuscan and Anatolian populations by comparing samples of their [[Mitochondrial DNA]]. Some links were found, which were used to support conclusions that the Etruscans came from Anatolia and were also related to the Turks. A recent review of these studies using [[Approximate Bayesian computation]] (methods of statistics) found that the conclusions were not warranted by the comparisons, as certain untrue assumptions had been made. The Tuscan and Anatolian populations had been assumed to be relatively closed; i.e., descended from ancestors also dwelling there. A comparison of the Tuscans with the Etruscans (known from their tombs) indicated the modern was not generally related to the ancient; i.e., the ancient Etruscans had been replaced and their descendants were not to be found except in isolated cases. Anatolia also had received immigrants from many different locations. Calculating the probability that ancient Etruscans could have come from Anatolia, the authors found \"the observed genetic similarities between modern Tuscans and Anatolians cannot be attributed to an immigration wave from the East leading to the onset of the\nEtruscan culture in Italy.\" The only model to account for the sparse similarities would have to be pushed back to the migrations of the Neolithic. {{cite journal | title=Genetic Evidence Does Not Support an Etruscan Origin in Anatolia | author1=Francesca Tassi | author2=Silvia Ghirotto | author3=David Caramelli | author4=Guido Barbujani | journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology | number=152 | pages=11\u201318 | year=2013 | url=http://www.guidobarbujani.it/images/Publications/Tassi-AJPA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile a greater question came to the fore. Throughout the Bronze Age the greatest power in Anatolia was the Hittites, with capital in central Anatolia. Why were there no links to them? How could the coastal states have avoided them? Anatolian studies expanded in the late 20th century. Those states had not avoided them, they were subject to them. Previously unknown scripts were found to be in Anatolian languages. The dominant one on the coast was [[Luwian]]. In the Luwian range west of the Hittite capital there was no room for any Etruscans. Whatever he was, Aeneas was not Etruscan, and whatever the ancestry of the imperial family at Rome was, which knew Etruscan and was counted as Tuscan, it derived no authority from ancient Troy.\n\nThe 1995 discovery of a [[Luwian]] biconvex seal at Troy sparked heated debate over the [[Trojan language|language that was spoken in Homeric Troy]]. Frank Starke of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] argued that the name of [[Priam]], king of Troy at the time of the [[Trojan War]], is related to the Luwian compound ''Priimuua'', which means \"exceptionally courageous\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Starke |first=Frank |title=Troia im Kontext des historisch-politischen und sprachlichen Umfeldes Kleinasiens im 2. Jahrtausend |journal=Studia Troica |year=1997 |volume=7 |pages=447\u201387}}</ref> Starke adds: \"The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community,\" although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.<ref>{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=116}}</ref>. The tablet was discovered in the lower city, archaeologically out of the way until now, but undoubtedly more populous and frequented than the citadel. It is possible that the major archive site has yet to be discovered at Troy, if any survived.\n\n=== Dark Age Troy ===\n[[File:Troy (Ilion), Turkey (7446237818).jpg|thumb|300px|Anatolian Grey Ware]]\nB.W. Fortson, IV, defines the [[Greek Dark Ages]] as \"The period from the demise of Mycenaean civilization to the earliest appearance of alphabetic Greek in the eighth century ....\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction | first=Benjamin W., IV | last=Fortson | edition=Second | location=Chichester, UK | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2010 | page=249}}</ref> The idea is that in the breakdown of peace and stability suffered by the Mycenaean kingdoms they entered a period of fear, isolation, and economic depression in which their writing system was lost causing a subsequent deficit of written records, interpreted by later historians as \"darkness.\" The view is too simple, however.\n\nWhile it is true that the palaces were destroyed by fire, it is untrue that they were all burned in the same year or even the same decade by a single wave of [[Dorian invasion|Dorian tribes]] from the region later known as [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. The dates of the destructions differ by as much as a generation. Chadwick asks, \"... where were all the Dorians during the Mycenaean period? And why were they content to wait in the wings until the time was right for this intrusion?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=192-193}}</ref> His own theory was that the Mycenaeans were incendiary to each other's palaces in a rash of infradynastic conflicts. These would have occupied the entire 11th century BC. There was no sudden influx of all the Dorians in one great invasion, but rather an insistent occupation of the Peloponnesus over a century or more. It has to be counted as Dorian from the 10th century BC on. Most of the former Achaean inhabitants escaped to the now depopulated coast of Anatolia as [[Ionians]] and [[Aeolians]]. Athens remained firm.\n\nAmong the Achaeans of [[Cyprus]], on the edge of the Greek world, writing failed to disappear. They continued to write their own conservative dialect, [[Arcadocypriot Greek]], in a few scripts of [[Cypriote syllabary]], which they had innovated on the model of Linear A and Linear B They were fairly isolated from their former homeland by the spread of Dorians to Crete, the southern Cyclades, and southern Anatolia. When the concept of a Greek alphabet arrived, they innovated with the Phoenician alphabet to make it fit their language, and the two systems continued side-by-side until Hellenistic times, when Attic became the common dialect. Meanwhile their dialect continued in the hills of [[Arcadia]], but it had no writing system there. This dark age interlude in Greece is not generally interpreted as a return to prehistoric times. It is a historic age with gaps in its history, which is how the archaeologists treat it.\n\nIn both Blegen and Korfmann, Homeric Troy ends at the end of Blegen's Troy VIIa, Korfmann's VIi, with the burning of the city, presumably by Achaeans. Legend has the Trojans vanishing away, either escaping, as did Aeneas and his very large band, being slaughtered, as were Priam and his wife, or being carted off into slavery, as were the literary Trojan women. Apparently, no Trojans seem to have been left. Their enemies would have cleared them entirely away, leaving the ruined city vacant and non-dangerous.\n\nThe archaeology suggests that the literary implication of a deserted city is probably not true. After a suitable interval of hiding somewhere else in the region, perhaps with the Dardanians, who were not defeated, but appeared as marauders among the sea peoples, or further inland with the Hittites, the Trojan remnants returned to Troy to rebuild Troy VIIb, which, according to Blegen, \"... obviously represents a direct survival of the culture that prevailed in Troy VIIa.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=165}}</ref> The initial VIIb period is VIIb1, which Korfmann suggests should be VIj.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=60}}</ref> and regards as \"transitional to the Early Iron Age.\" As yet, however, it is contemporary with LHIIIC (LBA) pottery on the mainland. The reconstruction does not appear to have been opposed by the palaces, such as at Pylos, which were still standing. The return to a simpler pottery causes Korfmann to hypothesize a \"humble folk\" investment of the ruins.\n\nTroy VIIb2 begins contemporaneously with LHIIIC, but at about 1050 BC the last of IIIC disappears, to be replaced by [[Sub-Mycenaean pottery]], a short-lived Mycenaean-like pottery with geometric motifs, considered transitional to [[Geometric art|Geometric pottery]], the ware characteristic everywhere in the Greek world of the [[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Age]]. The palaces can be counted as vanished, as the last pottery at Pylos was LH IIIC. Apparently, the city of the \"humble Trojans\" could not maintain itself, but was overrun or replaced. The latter part of Troy IIIb2 sees the replacement of their pottery with wares, such as \"Knobbed Ware,\" characteristic of the Balkan-Black Sea region. The Luwian seal presents a problem, as it is dated Troy VIIb2. Luwian speakers would not have been as far away as the northern Black Sea. If the seal is from early VIIb2, however, it can represent the last of the Luwian speakers at Troy. A mixed culture was certainly possible. Priam's wife, Hecuba, had been a Phrygian.\n\nBlegen ends his tale of Troy VII with VIIb2 around 1100 BC. The city was burned one last time, an event contemporaneous with the general destruction of the Mycenaean palaces. This would be the ethnical end of the Trojans at Troy by abandonment, but Blegen has a final suggestion. Troy VI was characterized by what Blegen calls \"Grey Minyan Ware,\" now Anatolian [[Minyan ware]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Pav\u00fak|first=Peter|title=Grey Wares as a Phenomenon|publisher=Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory|date=12 June 2007|url=http://www.aegeobalkanprehistory.net/article.php?id_art=5|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225120242/http://www.aegeobalkanprehistory.net/article.php?id_art=5|archivedate=25 December 2008}}</ref><ref group=note>The term Minyan Ware refers to any grey-to-black, burnished, undecorated pottery of simple shapes, such as bowls, of any time or location. Now that the non-destructive scientific ability exists to analyze the clay and identify the clay beds by the composition of the pots, \"Minyan Ware\" is further qualified by an adjective stating its provenience; hence \"Anatolian Minyan Ware,\" which can only have been made in Anatolia.</ref> or Anatolian Grey Ware. After the abandonment of the city, the ware appears in the highlands, leading Blegen to conjecture that the Trojans gradually withdrew in that direction.\n\nThe more recent excavations turned up additional information. In the lower city was pottery from the early and middle [[Protogeometric style|Proto-geometric period]], characteristic of the Dark Age. The Trojans may have escaped to the hills, but their burned city was occupied by their incendiary opponents, whoever they were. They brought iron with them, relying on the superior strength of iron weapons for their victory. Korfmann creates a new period for them, Troy VIIb3, 1020-950 BC.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the Iron-age people left their settlement about 950 BC, leaving it abandoned. Korfmann calls this interval a hiatus, meaning of residential occupation. A Greek colony arrived there to plant a new city about 750 BC, archaeological Troy VIII. They leveled the top of the mound to construct a temple to Athena, thus identifying themselves as being in the Attic-Ionic culture, as opposed to the Aeolic Greeks (Boeotia) who had previously been settling the north coast of Anatolia. The leveling process destroyed the previous structures at the center of the citadel. As Homeric Troy had been called \"sacred Ilium,\" Korfmann asserts that a temple district may have been maintained there during the apparent abandonment period, but whose is not known.\n\n=== Classical and Hellenistic Troy (Troy VIII) ===\nIn 480 BC, the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] sacrificed 1,000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 7.43.</ref> Following the Persian defeat in 480\u2013479, Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of [[Mytilene]] and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful [[Mytilenean revolt]] in 428\u2013427. Athens liberated the so-called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the [[Delian League]]. Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411, and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias. From c. 410\u2013399, Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at [[Lampsacus]] (Zenis, his wife Mania, and the usurper Meidias) who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap [[Pharnabazos II, Satrap of Phrygia|Pharnabazus]].\n\nIn 399, the Spartan general [[Dercylidas]] expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dynasts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad. Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at [[Dascylium]] until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387\u2013386. In this period of renewed Persian control c. 387\u2013367, a statue of [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias.<ref>Diodorus 17.17.6.</ref> In 360\u2013359 the city was briefly controlled by [[Charidemus]] of [[Oreus]], a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians.<ref>Demosthenes 23.154\u2013157; Aeneas Tacticus 24.3\u201314.</ref> In 359, he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios, whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of [[proxeny]]\u2014this is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion.<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 23.</ref> In May 334 [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Hellespont and came to the city, where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias, made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes, and made the city free and exempt from taxes.<ref>Arrian, ''Anabasis'' 1.11\u201312, Diodorus Siculus 17.17\u201318, Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'' 15, Justin 9.5.12, Strabo 13.1.26, 32.</ref> According to the so-called 'Last Plans' of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323, he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world.<ref>Diodorus 18.4.5.</ref>\n\n[[Antigonus Monophthalmus]] took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of [[Alexandria Troas|Antigoneia Troas]] which was a [[synoikism]] of the cities of [[Skepsis]], [[Cebren|Kebren]], [[Neandreia]], [[Hamaxitus|Hamaxitos]], [[Larisa (Troad)|Larisa]], and [[Kolonai]]. In c. 311\u2013306 the ''[[koinon]] ''of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the [[Dardanelles]] and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom (he had not respected the autonomy of the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia).<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 1.</ref> The ''koinon ''continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad, although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included [[Myrlea]] and [[Chalcedon]] from the eastern [[Propontis]].<ref>Myrlea and Calchedon: Inschriften von Ilion 5\u20136.</ref> The governing body of the ''koinon ''was the ''synedrion'' on which each city was represented by two delegates. The day-to-day running of the ''synedrion'', especially in relation to its finances, was left to a college of five ''agonothetai'', on which no city ever had more than one representative. This system of equal (rather than proportional) representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the ''koinon''.<ref>D. Knoepfler, \u2018Les agonoth\u00e8tes de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration d\u2019Ath\u00e9na Ilias: une interpretation nouvelle des donn\u00e9es \u00e9pigraphiques et ses cons\u00e9quences pour la chronologie des \u00e9missions mon\u00e9taires du Koinon\u2019 ''Studi Ellenistici'' 24 (2010) 33\u201362.</ref> The primary purpose of the ''koinon ''was to organize the annual Panathenaia festival which was held at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias. The festival brought huge numbers of pilgrims to Ilion for the duration of the festival as well as creating an enormous market (the ''panegyris'') which attracted traders from across the region.<ref>''Panegyris'': L. Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade (Paris 1966) 18\u201346.</ref> In addition, the ''koinon ''financed new building projects at Ilion, for example a new theatre c. 306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century, in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival.<ref>Theatre: Inschriften von Ilion 1.

These probably included [[Birytis]], [[Gentinos]], and Sigeion: J. M. Cook, ''The Troad ''(Oxford 1973) 364. Birytis and Gentinos are not securely located, but recent excavations at Sigeion appear to independently confirm Strabo\u2019s account by indicating an abandonment date soon after c. 300: Th. Sch\u00e4fer, ''Kaz\u0131 Sonu\u00e7lar\u0131 Toplant\u0131s\u0131'' 32.2 (2009) 410\u2013412, 33.2 (2012) 248\u2013249. This may have been punishment for Sigeion resisting Lysimachus in 302: Diodorus 20.107.4.</ref> Lysimachus was defeated at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in February 281 by [[Seleucus I Nikator]], thus handing the Seleucid kingdom control of [[Asia Minor]], and in August or September 281 when Seleucus passed through the Troad on his way to [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] in the nearby Thracian Chersonese Ilion passed a decree in honour of him, indicating the city's new loyalties.<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 31.</ref> In September Seleucus was assassinated at Lysimachia by [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], making his successor, [[Antiochus I Soter]], the new king. In 280 or soon after Ilion passed a long decree lavishly honouring Antiochus in order to cement their relationship with him.<ref group=note>Inschriften von Ilion 32. A minority of scholars instead attempt to date this inscription to the reign of Antiochus III (222\u2013187 BC).</ref> During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel, and in 278 during the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] the city was easily sacked.<ref>Strabo 13.1.27.</ref> Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign: for example, in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion, and c. 275\u2013269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle.<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 33 (Aristodikides), 34 (Metrodoros).</ref>\n\n=== Roman Troy (Troy IX) ===\nA new city called '''Ilium''' (from Greek Ilion) was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric in the [[Roman province]] [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] (civil [[Diocese of Asia]]), but declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]].\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[Sulla]]'s rival, the Roman general [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria|Fimbria]], in 85 BC following an eleven-day siege.<ref>Strabo 13.1.27, Livy, ''Periochae'' 83.</ref> Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city's rebuilding. Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year.<ref>''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.2\u20133.</ref> However, the city remained in financial distress for several decades, despite its favoured status with Rome. In the 80s BC, Roman ''publicani'' illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|L. Julius Caesar]] for restitution; while in 80 BC, the city suffered an attack by pirates.<ref>''Inchriften von Ilion'' 71 (''publicani''), 73 (pirates).</ref> In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the ''koinon'' of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the ''koinon'' and L. Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate, this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden.<ref>''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.</ref> In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general [[Lucullus]] against Mithridates VI.<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 10.3, 12.2.</ref> Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63\u201362, [[Pompey]] rewarded the city's loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias.<ref>''Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum'' 46.1565.</ref> In 48 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] likewise bestowed benefactions on the city, recalling the city's loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars, the city's connection with his cousin L. Julius Caesar, and the family's claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians.<ref>Lucan, ''Pharsalia'' 9.964\u2013999, Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 79.3.</ref>\n\nIn 20 BC, the Emperor [[Augustus]] visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen, Melanippides son of Euthydikos.<ref>Dio Cassius 54.7, ''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.</ref> As a result of his visit, he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias, the [[bouleuterion]] (council house) and the theatre. Soon after work on the theatre was completed in 12\u201311 BC, Melanippides dedicated a statue Augustus in the theatre to record this benefaction.<ref>''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.</ref>\n\n=== Ecclesiastical Troy in late antiquity ===\nNo later than the 4th century, it was a [[suffragan]] of the provincial capital's Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Cyzicus]], in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].\nSeveral bishops are historically documented:\n* Orion attended the [[First Ecumenical Council]] at [[Nicaea]] in 325\n* Leucadius was among the schismatic group of [[Arian]] heretical bishops abandoning the [[Council of Sardica]] and [[Council of Philippopolis]] in 344 to convene their alternative 'synod'.\n* Theosebius partook in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.\n* Johannes participated in the second [[Second Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] in 553.\n* Nicetas attended the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.\n* Georgius participated in the [[Council of Constantinople (869-870)|Council of Constantinople]] of 869\u2013870 which condemned Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios of Constantinople]].\n\n=== Modern ecclesiastical Troy ===\nThe diocese was nominally restored no later than 1926 as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of Ilium (Latin) / Ilio (Curiate Italian) / Ilien(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nIt has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:\n* [[Michel d'Herbigny]] [[Jesuit Order|S.J.]] (1926.02.11 \u2013 1937.07)\n* James Maguire (1939.10.05 \u2013 1944.10.10)\n* Eugene Joseph McGuinness (1944.11.11 \u2013 1948.02.01)\n* Leo John Steck (1948.03.13 \u2013 1950.06.19)\n* Francesco Maria Franco (1950.07.10 \u2013 1968.02.07)\n\n== Alternative views ==\n\n=== Unusual locations ===\nA small minority of contemporary writers argue that Homeric Troy was not at the Hisarlik site, but elsewhere in Anatolia or outside it\u2014e.g. in England,<ref>{{cite book | first=Iman Jacobs | last=Wilkens | title=Where Troy Once Stood: The Mystery of Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' revealed | location=[[Groningen]] | publisher= Rider & Co | year=1990 | page=68 | isbn=978-0-7126-2463-3| title-link=Where Troy Once Stood }}</ref> [[Pergamum]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lascelles|first1=John|title=Troy: The World Deceived.

The location in the present day is the hill of [[Hisarlik]] and its immediate vicinity. In modern scholarly nomenclature, the Ridge of Troy (including Hisarlik) borders the Plain of Troy, flat agricultural land, which conducts the lower [[Karamenderes River|Scamander River]] to the strait. Troy was the setting of the [[Trojan War]] described in the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], in particular in the ''[[Iliad]]'', one of the two epic poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[metre (poetry)|Metrical]] evidence from the ''Iliad'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' suggests that the name {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (''Ilion'') formerly began with a [[digamma]]: {{lang|grc|\u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (''Wilion'');<ref name=met group=note/> this is also supported by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name for what is thought to be the same city, [[Wilusa]].\n\nAfter a destruction at the end of the Bronze Age, believed to represent the end of the Trojan War, and a period of abandonment or near-abandonment during the subsequent Dark Age, the site acquired a new population of Greek-speakers, who built a classical city that became along with the rest of Anatolia a part of the Persian Empire. The Troad was liberated by Alexander the Great, an admirer of Achilles, who he believed had the same type of glorious (but short-lived) destiny. After the Roman conquest of this now Hellenistic Greek-speaking world, a new capital called '''Ilium''' (from Greek: \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Ilion'') was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric, was abandoned, repopulated for a few centuries in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], was abandoned again, and is now a Latin Catholic [[titular see]]. Most recently it has risen to prominence as an archaeological site.\n\nIn the mid-19th century the Calvert family, wealthy Levantine English settlers of the Troad, occupying a working farm a few miles from Hisarlik, purchased much of the hill in the belief that it contained the ruins of Troy. They were antiquarians. Two of the family, Frederick and especially the youngest, Frank, surveyed the Troad and conducted a number of trial excavations there. In 1865, [[Frank Calvert]] excavated trial trenches on the hill, discovering the Roman settlement. Realizing he did not have the funds for a full excavation, he attempted to recruit the British Museum, and was refused. A chance meeting with Calvert in [[\u00c7anakkale]] and a visit to the site by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also looking for Troy, offered a second opportunity for funding.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=54\u201355}}.</ref> Schliemann had been at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |title=The Trojans and their neighbours |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-34959-8 |page=37}}</ref> As Schliemann was about to leave the area, Calvert wrote to him asking him to take over the entire excavation. Schliemann agreed. The Calverts, who made their money in the diplomatic service, expedited the acquisition of a Turkish [[firman]]. In 1868, Schliemann excavated an initial deep trench across the mound called today \"Schliemann's trench.\" These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Subsequent excavations by following archaeologists elaborated on the number and dates of the cities. \n\nToday a small village near the ruins, Tevfikiye, supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site. It lies within the [[\u00c7anakkale Province|province of \u00c7anakkale]], some {{convert|30|km|mi}} south-west of the provincial capital, also called \u00c7anakkale. The current map shows Ilium a little way inland from the Scamander estuary across the plain of Troy. According to Korfmann, due to Troy's location near the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Black Sea]], it was a central hub for military activities and trade, and the chief site of a culture he calls the \"Maritime Troja Culture,\" which extended over the region between the Black and Aegean Seas.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=27}}</ref>\n\nTroy was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.\n\n== Homeric Troy ==\n[[File:Polyxena_Sarcophagus_Now_in_Troy_Museum_7938.jpg|thumb|left|Polyxena Sarcophagus in [[Troy Museum]], named after the depiction of the sacrifice of [[Polyxena]], the last act of the Greeks at Troy.]]\n{{Further|Homeric Question|Historicity of the Iliad}}\n[[File:Troas.png|thumb|285px|Map of the Troad, including the site of Troy]]\n'''Homeric Troy''' refers primarily to the city described in the [[Iliad]], the earliest literary work in Europe. This is a long originally oral poem in its own dialect of ancient Greek in [[dactylic hexameter]], in tradition composed by a blind poet of the Anatolian Greek coast, [[Homer]]. It covers the 10th year of a war against Troy conducted by a coalition of [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]], or Greek, states under the leadership of a high king, [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]]. The city was defended by a coalition of states in the [[Dardanelles]] and West Anatolian region under another high king, [[Priam]], whose capital was Troy. The cause of the war was the elopement of Agamemnon's brother's wife, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], with [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], a prince of Troy. \n\nAfter the literary time of the poem, the city was destroyed when the Greeks pretended to leave after secreting a squad of soldiers in a gigantic [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse monument]], which the Trojans brought inside the walls.<ref group=note>In the spirit of Schliemann, which tries to match legendary events with archaeology, one theory suggests a gate modified in Troy VII (or late Troy VI) resulted from the Trojans dismantling the gate to admit the horse. {{cite book |last=A\u015fkin |first=Mustafa |title=Troy |year=1981 |publisher=Keskin |location=Istanbul |edition=2005 rev |page=[https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 34] |isbn=978-975-7559-37-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 }}</ref> In the dead of night they exited the horse and opened the gates to the Achaeans nearby. Troy was burned and the population slaughtered, although many had other fates.\n\nBesides the ''Iliad'', there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer, the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as well as in other ancient Greek literature (such as [[Aeschylus]]'s [[The Oresteia|Oresteia]]). The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''. The fall of Troy with the story of the Trojan Horse and the sacrifice of Polyxena, Priam's youngest daughter, is the subject of a later Greek epic by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] (\"Quintus of Smyrna\").\n\nThe Greeks and Romans took for a fact the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the Trojan War]] and the identity of Homeric Troy with a site in Anatolia on a peninsula called the [[Troad]] ([[Biga Peninsula]]).

There are consequently no historians from the period. Writing reappeared in the Archaic Period, after which, in the Classical Period, many historians turned their pens to record such histories of the Trojan War as had survived in oral tradition. They offer a span of about two centuries from the 1334 BC date of [[Duris of Samos]] to the 1135 BC date of Ephoros of Kyme in [[Aeolis]].

If the legend had taken root from a real city, where would that have been? Travellers in Anatolia looked for possible locations. Because of its name, the [[Troad]] peninsula was highly suspect.\n\nEarly modern travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries, including [[Pierre Belon]] and [[Pietro Della Valle]], had identified Troy with [[Alexandria Troas]], a ruined town approximately {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of the currently accepted location.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=184}} In the late 18th century, [[Jean Baptiste LeChevalier]] identified a location near the village of [[:tr:P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131, Ezine|P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131, Ezine]], a mound approximately {{convert|5|km|mi}} south of the currently accepted location.

Picture was excised from a family group photograph displaying 12 persons in front of the farmhouse near Hisarlik<ref name=allen-1995-380>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=380}}</ref>]]\nFrank Calvert was born into an English [[Latin Church in Turkey|Levantine family]] on [[Malta]] in 1828. He was the youngest of six sons and one daughter born to James Calvert and his wife, the former Louisa Lander, the sister of Charles Alexander Lander, James' business partner. In social standing they were of the aristocracy. James was a distant relative of the Calverts who founded Baltimore, Maryland,<ref name=robinson153>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=153}}</ref> and Louisa was a direct descendant of the Campbells of Argyll (Scottish clansmen).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=26}}</ref> Not having inherited any wealth, they took to the colonies, married in Ottoman Smyrna in 1815, and settled in Malta, which had changed hands from the French to the [[British Empire]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. They associated with the \"privileged\" social circles of Malta, but they were poor. James clerked in the mail and grain offices of the Civil Service.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=26-31}}</ref>\n\nThe family regarded itself as a single enterprise. They shared property, assisted each other, lived together and had common interests, one of which was the antiquities of the Troad. They did not do well in Malta, but in 1829 the Dardanelles region underwent an upswing of its business cycle due to historical circumstances. The [[Greek War of Independence]] was about to be concluded in favor of an independent state by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]]. The [[Levant Company]], which had had a monopoly on trade through the Dardanelles, was terminated. The price in pounds of the Turkish piastre fell. A manyfold increase in British traffic through straits was anticipated. A new type of job suddenly appeared: British Consul in the Dardanelles, which brought wealth with it.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=32}}</ref><ref group=note>By Ottoman law every ship entering the Dardanelles from the Aegean must stop at \u00c7anakkale to acquire one or more [[firman]]s or permissions for a fee. The total bill included other fees as well. The Turkish officials did not themselves service the ships. Instead they allowed each nation to hire a resident consul or consular agent to reside in \u00c7anakkale and greet and service each ship as it came in. They were allowed to apply a schedule of consular fees in addition for this service. One individual might be an agent for more than one nation. Hard-working agents such as the Calverts grew rich on the fees, regardless of whether they were also paid a salary. Agents were not subject to Turkish law, but they might be removed if complaints of extortion or skimming the Turkish fees were made. The best and richest of the agents made themselves as charismatic as possible by living an ostentatious life, throwing parties and dinners, staging hunting expeditions, loaning money to the natives and just generally being charitable and sympathetic. Large numbers of these agents were soon found in most of the Mediterranean ports of the Ottoman Empire. It was a way to get rich quick. A recent study of these consular positions and men who filled them can be found in {{harvnb|Levantine Heritage Foundation|2013}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Lander====\nCharles Lander applied, and was made British Consul of the Dardanelles in 1829. He spoke five languages, knew the region well, and had the best connections. A row of new consular offices was being constructed in \u00c7anakkale along the shore of the strait. He was at first poor. In 1833 he bought a house in town ample enough to invite his sister's sons to join him in the enterprise. Without exception they left home at 16 to be tutored in the trade at their uncle's house and placed in lucrative consular positions. Frederick, the eldest, stayed on to assist Charles. The youngest, Frank, at school in Athens, arrived last, but his interest in archaeology led him into a different career.<ref name=robinson153/>\n\n\u00c7anakkale was a boom town. In 1831 Lander married Adele, a brief but idyllic relationship that gave them three daughters in quick succession. When the Calverts began to arrive, finding quarters in the crowded town proved to be difficult. The Turkish building code requiring buildings of wood, conflagrations were frequent.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=15}}</ref> The family escaped one fire with nothing but the clothes they were wearing.<ref>{{harvnb|Levantine Heritage Foundation|2013|p=10}}</ref> Lander's collection of books on the Troad was totally destroyed. In 1840 Lander suffered a tragedy when his wife, Adele, died in her 40's, leaving three small children. He chose this time to settle his estate, making Frederick his legal heir, guardian of his children, and co-executor (along with himself). \n\nLander dedicated himself to the consular service, leaving the details of the estate and its reponsibilites to Frederick. The family grew wealthy on the fees paid by the ships they serviced. When Frank arrived in 1845 with his sister he had nothing much to do. By this time the family had a new library. Using its books Frank explored the Troad.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=154}}</ref> He and Lander became collectors. The women in the family took a supportive role as well.\n\n====Frederick Calvert====\nLander died in 1846 of a fever endemic to the region, leaving Frederick as executor of the will and head of the family. In 1847 he assumed his uncle's consular position. He was also an agent of Lloyd's of London, which insured ship cargos. Despite Frank's youth he began to play an important role in the family consular business, especially when Frederick was away.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=17-22}}</ref> A few years prior to the death of Lander, the population of \u00c7anakkale was on the rise, from 10,000 in 1800 to 11,000 in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|1994|p=157}}</ref> The British numbered about 40 families.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=16}}</ref> The increase in ship traffic meant prosperity for the Calverts, who expedited the ships of several nations, including the United States. They had other ambitions: James William Whittall, British consul in Istanbul, was spreading his doctrine of the \"Trojan Colonization Society,\" (never more than an idea) which was influential on the Calverts, whom he visited.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=99}}</ref>\n\n=====Calvert investments in the Troad=====\nIn 1847, Frederick, deciding to colonize, invested the profits of the family business in two large tracts in the Troad, amounting to many thousands of acres.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=22, 266}}</ref><ref group=note>Legally he was accessing the Lander money as trustee for the children. The properties were in his wife's name, as foreign males were not allowed to own real estate. Deeds were quitclaim.</ref> He founded a company, Calvert Bros. and Co., an \"extended family company.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=86}}</ref> The first purchase was a farm at [[Erenk\u00f6y, \u00c7anakkale|Erenk\u0151y]], 12 mi. to the SE of \u00c7anakkale. Frederick used it as a station for ships that could not make the straits. The area was a target for Greek immigration. The family became money-lenders, lending only to Greeks at rates considered high (20%).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=267}}</ref>\n\nThe station being too far from \u00c7anakkale, Calvert bought a farm he intended to work, the Batak Farm, at Ak\u00e7a K\u00f6y, 4 mi. to the southeast of Hisarlik. It harvested and marketed the cups and acorns of [[Quercus macrolepis]], the Valonia Oak, from which valonia, a compound used in dying and tanning, is extracted. The farm also raised cotton and wheat and bred horses. Frederick introduced the latest farm technology and drained the wetlands, diminishing the frequency of mosquitos and incidence of malaria, although at the time he could not have known the specific links to the \"bad air.\" The farm eventually became famous as a way station for archaeologists and the home of the Calvert collection of antiquities. The main house, featuring multiple guest bedrooms, was situated on a low ridge in a compound with several outbuildings. It was more of a manor, operated by farm workers and domestic servants.\n\nIn 1850\u20131852 Frederick solved the residence problem by having a mansion built for him in \u00c7anakkale. Two Turkish houses were said to have been put together, but Turkish houses were required to be of wood. This one was of massive stone, which was permitted to foreigners, and was placed partly on fill jetting into the straits. It probably was the length of two Turkish houses. It remained the major building of the town until it was removed in 1942, due to earlier earthquake damage. The Town Hall was then built on the site. The mansion's extensive gardens became a public park.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=382}}</ref>\n\nThe entire family of the times took up permanent residence in the mansion, which was never finished. Being well-suited for a consular residence, it was almost always occupied by visitors and social events. The Calverts began a tour-guide business, conducting visitors throughout the Troad. Frank was the chief guide. The women held musicales and sang in the salons. The house attracted a steady stream of distinguished visitors, each with a theory about the location of Troy. Frederick, however, was not there for the opening of the house. After a fall from a horse in 1851, complications forced him to seek medical care in London for 18 months,<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=267}}</ref> the first of a series of disasters that would test him subsequently. He was back by 1853. Meanwhile, young Frank had the supervision of the business.\n\n=====Crimean War debacle=====\nThe society to which Frederick returned was engaged in the beginning of the [[Crimean War]], October 1853 through February 1856. Russia had arbitrarily occupied the Danube frontier of the [[Ottoman Empire]] including the [[Crimea]], and Britain and France were providing military assistance to the Ottomans. The rear of the conflict was Istanbul and the Dardanelles. Britain relied heavily on the Levantine families for interfacing, intelligence, and guidance. Edmund Calvert was a British agent, but this was not Frederick's calling. He returned to find a British army of 10,000 men held up in ships in the straits, with no place to bivouac, no supplies, and a commissariat of four non-Turkish speakers.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=86-89}}</ref>\n\nThe British Army had reached a low point of efficiency since Wellington.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=13}}</ref> Although it was the responsibility of Parliament, the fact that the crown retained the perogative of command made them hesitate to update it, for fear of its being used against them.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=4}}</ref> One of the major problems was the fragmentation of the administration into \"a number of separate, distinct, and mutually independent authorities,\" with little centralization.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=7}}</ref> There were always devastating issues of who was in command and what they commanded. A [[Supply Corps]] as such did not exist. The immediate needs of the soldiers were supplied by the [[Commissariat|Commissariat Department]], responsible to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harpan|1976|p=12}}</ref> [[Commissary|Commissaries]] were assigned to units as needed, but they acted to solve supply problems ad hoc. They had no idea beforehand what the army needed, or what it had, or where it was located.\n\nAll the needs were contracted out. Contractors usually required money in advance. They were allowed to take out loans with recommended banks. The Commissariat then paid the banks, but should it fail to do so, the debts were still incumbent on the debtors. Contracting for the government was a high risk business. Contractors therefore were allowed to charge a percentage for their services, and also to include a percentage given to their suppliers as enticement. The Commissariat could thus build entire impromptu supply departments on the basis of immediate need, which is what Frederick did for them.<ref name=allen-1999-87-88>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|pp=87-88}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[logistics]] problems were of the same type customarily undertaken by the consular staff, but of larger scale, Frederick was able to perform critical services for the army. Within several days he had all the men billeted ashore and had developed an organization of local suppliers on short notice. He secured their immediate attention by offering higher interest rates, to which the Commissary did not then object. He was so successful that he was given the problem of transporting men and supplies to the front.<ref group=note>The current in the Dardanelles was about 4 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], requiring a wait by sailing ships for the winds to overcome it. Troop and supply movements neeeded a more timely and predictable schedule. The Land Transport Department of the Commissary therefore undertook to develop overland trails and use horses and mules as pack animals. There were no roads or railroads. Frederick also was able to procure a few steamers to use as tugs for supply ships.</ref> For that he developed his own transport division of contractors paid as direct employees of his own company. He also advised the Medical Department in their choice of a site near Erenk\u00f6y for a military hospital.<ref name=allen-1999-87-88/>\n\nThe army, arriving at Gallipoli in April, 1854, did well at first, thanks to the efforts of Frederick Calvert and his peers. They were contracted by Deputy Assistant Commander-General of the Commissariat, John William Smith, on the instruction of the Commander-General, William Filder, who had given Smith their names in advance, especially that of Frederick Calvert. Frederick was waiting for the fleet in Gallipoli.<ref>{{harvnb|Harpin|1976|p=76}}</ref><ref group=note>The Commissary at this time was entirely civilian, accountable only to the Treasury. Its ranks were named the same as military ranks to give them credibility to the military, but there the resemblance ends. The date: March is sometimes given, but this is the date the commissaries arrived. The name: there were so many \u201cSmiths\u201d among the dignitaries that the sources confuse which was which. A common error identifies \u201cGeneral Smith\u201d with Deputy Assistant Comissary-General Charles Bagot-Smith. Lord Trevelyan, however, explicitly identifies John William as the commissary who contacted and handled Calvert and the other contractors: {{harvnb|House of Commons|1856|pp=15-17}}</ref> By June the army was doing badly. The Commissary seemed to have no understanding of military schedules. Needed supplies were not getting to their destinations for a number of reasons: perishables were spoiled through delay, cargos were lost or abandoned because there was no tracking system, or cut because a commissary speculated that they should be, etc. Frederick attempted to carry on by using his own resources in the expectation of collecting the money later by due process. By the end of the war his bill to the Commissary would be  several thousand pounds. He had had to mortgage family properties in the Troad.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=88}}</ref>\n\nBy June it was obvious to Parliament that the cabinet position of \u201cSecretary of State for War and the Colonies\u201d was beyond the ability of only one minister. He was divested of his colonial duties, leaving him as Secretary of State for War,<ref>{{harvnb|Harpin|1976|p=18}}</ref> but the Commissary was still not in his domain. In August, Frederick purchased the winter feed for the animals and left it on the dock at Salonica. Filder had adopted a policy of purchasing hay from London and having it pressing for land transport, even though chopped hay was readily available at a much cheaper price around the Dardanelles.<ref>{{harvnb|Tulloch|1857|p=144}}</ref> The Commissariat was supposed to inspect and accept it at Salonica, but the presses had been set up in the wrong location.  By the time they were ready for the hay, most of it had spoiled, so they did not accept any of it.\n\n====Frank Calvert====\nIn 1866, [[Frank Calvert]], the brother of the United States' [[Consul|consular agent]] in the region, made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium (which was on farmland owned by his family) on the same site. The hill, near the city of [[\u00c7anakkale]], was known as Hisarlik.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=42\u201344}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy, spent more than 60 years in the Troad (modern day [[Biga, \u00c7anakkale|Biga]] peninsula, Turkey) conducting field work.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=379}}.</ref> As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region, his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might have existed on the hill, and played a major role in convincing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at Hisarlik.<ref name=allen-1995-380/>\n\n=== The Schliemanns ===\n[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1878) b 713.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Heinrich Schliemann]]\nIn 1868, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate [[Hisarlik]]. He sincerely believed that the literary events of the works of Homer could be verified archaeologically. A divorced man in his 40's who had acquired some wealth as a merchant in Russia, he decided to use the wealth to follow his boyhood interest in finding and verifying the city of Troy. Leaving his former life behind, he advertised for a wife whose skills and interest were on a par with his own, Sophia. She was 17 at the time but together they excavated Troy, sparing no expense.\n\n[[File:Sophia schliemann.gif|thumb|Sophia Schliemann wearing the \"Jewels of Helen,\" a famed piece in the Priam's Treasure collection.]]\nHeinrich began by excavating a trench across the mound of Hisarlik to the depth of the settlements, today called \"Schliemann's Trench.\" In 1871\u201373 and 1878\u201379, he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the Roman period. He declared one of these cities\u2014at first Troy I, later Troy II\u2014to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time. Subsequent archaeologists at the site were to revise the date upward; nevertheless, the main identification of Troy as the city of the [[Iliad]], and the scheme of the layers, have been kept. \n\nSome of Schliemann's portable finds at Hisarlik have become known as [[Priam's Treasure]], such as the jewelry photographed displayed on Sophia. The artifacts were acquired from him by the [[Museum Island|Berlin museums]]. As Sophia matured she became an invaluable assistant to Schliemann, whom he employed especially in social situations requiring the use of modern Greek. After his death she became caretaker of his funds and publications, continuing to advocate for his beliefs. She was a respected socialite in Athens.\n\n=== Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld ===\n[[File:Doerpfeld2.jpg|thumb|100px|Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]]\n[[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] {{nowrap|(1893\u201394)}} joined the excavation at the request of Schliemann.

These archaeologists, though following Schliemann's lead, added a professional approach not available to Schliemann. He showed that there were at least nine cities. In his research, Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy's nine levels could be further divided into forty-six sublevels,<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=259}}.</ref> which he published in his main report.</ref>{{cite book | first=Carl W. | last=Blegen | title=Troy; excavations conducted by the University of Cincinnati, 1932\u20131938 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1950}}</ref>\n\n=== Korfmann ===\nIn 1988, excavations were resumed by a team from the University of T\u00fcbingen and the [[University of Cincinnati]] under the direction of Professor [[Manfred Korfmann]], with Professor [[C. Brian Rose|Brian Rose]] overseeing Post-Bronze Age (Greek, Roman, Byzantine) excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy. Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire-damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC. The question of Troy's status in the Bronze-Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the T\u00fcbingen historian [[Frank Kolb]] in 2001\u20132002.\n\nKorfmann proposed that the location of the city (close to the [[Dardanelles]]) indicated a commercially oriented city that would have been at the center of a vibrant trade between the Black Sea, Aegean, Anatolian and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Kolb disputed this thesis, calling it \"unfounded\" in a 2004 paper. He argues that archaeological evidence shows that economic trade during the [[Late Bronze Age]] was quite limited in the Aegean region compared with later periods in antiquity. On the other hand, the Eastern Mediterranean economy was more active during this time, allowing for commercial cities to develop only in the [[Levant]]. Kolb also noted the lack of evidence for trade with the [[Hittite Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kolb |first1= F.|date=2004 |title=Forum Article: Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City? |url= |journal=American Journal of Archaeology American Journal of Archaeology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 577\u2013613|doi= 10.3764/aja.108.4.577|jstor=40025731}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1993, following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort, a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city.

In the olive groves surrounding the citadel, there are portions of land that were difficult to plow, suggesting that there are undiscovered portions of the city lying there. The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250&nbsp;BC, and it has been also suggested\u2014based on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann's team\u2014that this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy.\n\n=== Becker ===\n[[Helmut Becker]] utilized magnetometry in the area surrounding Hisarlik.

In 1998 the park was accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn 2015 a Term Development Revision Plan was applied to the park. Its intent was to develop the park into a major tourist site.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Troy National Park to be renovated | journal=Daily Sabah | date=30 October 2015 | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/life/2015/10/30/troy-national-park-to-be-renovated}}</ref> Plans included marketing research to determine the features most of interest to the public, the training of park personnel in tourism management, and the construction of campsites and facilities for those making day trips. These latter were concentrated in the village of Tevfikiye, which shares Troy Ridge with Troy.\n\n[[File:Troy (and a trojan horse) (8709942456).jpg|thumb|200px|Wooden Trojan Horse monument in the plaza before the modern gate to the ancient city]]\nPublic access to the ancient site is along the road from the vicinity of the museum in Tevfikiye to the east side of Hisarlik. Some parking is available. Typically visitors come by bus, which disembarks its passengers into a large plaza ornamented with flowers and trees and some objects from the excavation. In its square is a large wooden horse monument, with a ladder and internal chambers for use of the public. Bordering the square is the gate to the site. The public passes through turnstiles. Admission is usually not free. Within the site the visitors tour the features on dirt roads or for access to more precipitous features on railed boardwalks. There are many overlooks with multilingual boards explaining the feature. Most are outdoors, but a permanent canopy covers the site of an early megaron and wall.\n\n== Troy as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\nThe archaeological site of Troy was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.\n\nFor a site to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it must be claimed to have Outstanding Universal Value. This means that it must be historically, culturally, or scientifically significant to all peoples of the world in some manner. According to the UNESCO site on Troy, its historical significance was gained because the site displays some of the \"first contact between...Anatolia and the Mediterranean world\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/|title=Archaeological Site of Troy|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The site's cultural significance is gained from the multitudes of literature regarding the famed city and history over centuries. Many of the structures dating to the Bronze Age and the Roman and Greek periods are still standing at Hisarlik. These give archeological significance to the site as well. \n\nMore information on the UNESCO qualifications of Troy can be found on the [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/ UNESCO website].\n\n== Troy Museum ==\n{{main|Troy Museum}}\n[[File:Troy_Museum_9919.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Troy Museum subterranean interior.]]\n[[File:Troy Museum 9913.jpg|thumb|220px|Troy Museum aboveground.

A design contest for the architecture had been won by Yalin Mimarlik in 2011. The cube-shaped building with extensive underground galleries holds more than 40,000 portable artifacts, 2000 of which are on display. Artifacts were moved here from a few other former museums in the region. The range is the entire prehistoric Troad. Displays are multi-lingual. In many cases the original contexts are reproduced.\n\n== Priam's Treasure ==\n{{main|Priam's Treasure}}\n[[File:Priam's treasure.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Priam's Treasure]], which [[Heinrich Schliemann]] claimed to have found at Troy]]\nSome of the most notable artifacts uncovered at Hisarlik are known as [[Priam's Treasure]]. Most of these pieces were crafted from gold and other precious metals. Heinrich Schliemann put this assemblage together from his first excavation site, which he thought to be the remains of Homeric Troy. He gave them this name after King Priam, who is said in the ancient literature to have ruled during the Trojan War. However, the site that housed the treasure was later identified as Troy II, whereas Priam's Troy would most likely have been Troy VIIa (Blegen) or Troy VIi (Korfmann).<ref name=seven group=note/> One of the most famous photographs of Sophia made not long after the discovery depicts her wearing a golden headdress, which is known as the \"Jewels of Helen\" (see under Schliemann above).\n\nOther pieces that are a part of this collection are:\n\n* copper artifacts - a shield, cauldron, axeheads, lance heads, daggers, etc.\n* silver artifacts - vases, goblets, knife blades, etc.\n* gold artifacts - bottle, cups, rings, buttons, bracelets, etc.\n* terra cotta goblets\n* artifacts with a combination of precious metals\n\nMore information on these treasures can be found on the [[Priam's Treasure]] site.\n\n== Fortifications of the city ==\n[[File:Troy (Ilion), Turkey (7446656654).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Artist's representation of House VI M, part of the palatial complex]]\nLiterary Troy was characterized by high walls and towers, summarized by the epithet \"lofty Ilium.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Ilium | editor=William Smith | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | year=2020 | origyear=1854 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DI%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dilium-geo}}</ref> Some other epithets were \"well-walled,\" \"with lofty gates,\" \"with fine towers.\"<ref>Blegen's study of the Homeric epithets bearing on the architecture of Troy may be found at {{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=16}}</ref> Any archaeological candidate for being the literary city would therefore have to show evidence for the walls and towers.

Hisarlik, the name of the hill on which Troy is situated, is Turkish for \"the fortress.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=23}}</ref>\n\nThe walls of Troy, first erected in the Bronze Age between at least 3000 and 2600 BC, were its main defense, as is true of almost any ancient city of urban size. Whether Troy Zero featured walls is not yet known. Some of the known walls were placed on virgin soil (see the archaeology section below). The early date of the walls suggests that defense was important and warfare was a looming possibility right from the beginning.\n\nThe walls surround the citadel, extending for several hundred meters, and at the time they were built were over {{convert|17|feet|m|lk=on}} tall.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|last=the Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=November 22, 2016|website=|access-date=}}</ref> They were made of limestone, with watchtowers and brick ramparts, or elevated mounds that served as protective barriers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second run of excavations, under Korfmann, revealed that the walls of the first run were not the entire suite of walls for the city, and only partially represent the citadel. According to Korfmann, \"There was also a lower city that went with the Late Bronze Age Troja,...1750-1200 BCE.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=29}}</ref> This city had a perimeter 0f {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} end enclosed an area 16 times that of the citadel.

The stone part of the walls currently in evidence were \"...five meters thick and at least eight meters high - and over that a mudbrick superstructure several meters high...,\" which totals to about {{convert|15|m|ft}} for the citadel walls at about the time of the Trojan War. The present-day walls of Troy, then, portray little of the ancient city's appearance, any more than bare foundations characterize a building.\n{{Gallery\n| title        =Foundations of the citadel fortifications\n| align        =left\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Truva, 1962) - BEIC 6339269.jpg\n | alt1=\n | Troy I tower and wall\n| File:Turkey-2941 (2216425111).jpg\n | alt2=\n | South gate wall and tower, Early Troy I through Middle Troy II<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=48}}</ref>\n| File:Troy Walls.jpg\n | alt3=\n | Troy IV wall\n| File:Troja mury obronne RB.jpg\n | alt4=\n | Troy VI east tower\n| File:Troja03.jpg\n | alt5=\n | Troy VI cul-de-sac at east gate\n| File:Walls of Troy (2).jpg\n | alt6=\n | Troy VI east tower and wall of cul-de-sac\n| File:Troy walls VII and IX.jpg\n | alt7=\n | Troy VI wall on the left, Troy IX wall on right.

Exposed rock displays layers of a similar composition and fossil content within a layer discontinuous with other layers above and below it. The layer represents an accumulation of detritus over a continuous time, different from the times of the other layers.\n\nSimilarly Schliemann found layers of distinctive soil each containing more or less distinctive artifacts differing often markedly from other layers. He had no ready explanation for the discontinuity between layers, such as \"destruction,\" although this interpretation has sometimes been applied. Presumably \"destruction\" is to be interpreted to mean some sort of malicious event perpetrated by humans or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. In most cases no such disaster can be proved. On the contrary, the \"many layers illustrate the gradual development of civilization in northwestern Asia Minor.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref group=note>The view presented by Encyclopedia Britannica is self-contradictory, the reason being that different sources place different interpretations on archaeological layering. To some, layers represent new peoples sweeping in and destroying the old population centers, to place their own settlements there. Such dramatic events do sometimes happen. Archaeologists of the late 19th and early 20th century tended to adopt this \"invasion\" view, but later it became evident that in most cases invasions were mainly speculative. The evidence usually supported no such thing. The tendency today is to look for slow transitions from one culture to another in the same region. Other statements in the Britannica article support this view. The best example is \"the search for Troy;\" that is, the long effort to identify any evidence of the historical destruction of Troy. If this most obvious question cannot be settled, then destructions for every layer are less likely.</ref>\n\nThe discontinuities of culture in different layers might be explained in a number of ways. A settlement might have been abandoned for peaceful reasons, or it might have undergone a renovation phase. These are hypotheses that must be ruled in or ruled out by evidence, or simply be left unruled until evidence should be discovered.\n\nWhat Schliemann found is that the area now called \"the citadel\" or \"the upper city\" was apparently placed on virgin soil. It was protected by fortifications right from the start. The layering effect was caused in part by the placement of new fortifications and new houses over the old. Schliemann called these fortified enclosures \"cities\" (rightly or wrongly). In his mind the site was composed of successive cities. Like everyone else, he speculated whether a new city represented a different population, and what its relationship to the old was. He numbered the cities I, II, etc., I being on the bottom. Subsequent archaeologists turned the \"cities\" into layers (rightly or wrongly), named according to the new archaeological naming conventions then being developed. \nThe layers of ruins in the citadel at [[Hisarlik]] are numbered Troy I{{spaced ndash}}Troy IX, with various subdivisions.\n\n{{side box | above='''The Layers of Troy''' | image=[[File:Layers of Troy.JPG|thumb|350px|center|In this photograph, depicting \"the Schliemann trench,\" different layers have been identified by sign for the convenience of the visitors.]]}}\n\nUntil the late 20th century, these layers represented only the layers on the hill of Hisarlik. Archaeologists following Schliemann picked up the trail of his researches adopting the same fundamental assumptions, culminating in the work and writings of [[Carl Blegen]] in the mid-20th century. In a definitive work, ''Troy and the Trojans'', he summarized the layers names and the dates he had adopted for them.<ref name=bleg174>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=174}}</ref> Without further excavation, Blegen's was the last word. There were, however, some persistent criticisms not answered to general satisfaction. Hisarlik, about the size of a football field, was not large enough to have been the mighty city of history. It was also far inland, yet the general historical tradition suggested it must have been close to the sea.\n\nThe issues finally devolved on the necessity for further excavation, which was undertaken by Korfmann starting 1988. He concentrated on the Roman city, which was not suspected as being over Bronze Age remains. A Bronze Age city, at low elevations, was discovered beneath it. As it is unlikely that there were two Troys side by side, the lower city must have been the main seat of residence, to which the upper city served as citadel. Korfman now referred to the layers of the lower city as associated with the layers of the citadel. The same layering scheme was applicable. The lower city was many times the size of the citadel, answering the size objection. \n\n[[File:Troja-Blick-Schliemanngraben.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The view from Schliemann's Trench at Hisarl\u0131k across the modern plain of Ilium to the [[Aegean Sea]]. The suburbs of \u00c7anakkale are visible in the distance. During the early Troy periods, nearly this entire plain was an inlet of the sea.]]\nMeanwhile independent geoarchaeological research conducted by taking ground cores over a wide area of the Troad were demonstrating that, in the time of Troy I, \"... the sea was right at the foot of 'Schliemann's Trench' during the earliest periods of Troja.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kayan|2003|p=394}}</ref> A few thousand years earlier the ridge of Troy was partly surrounded by an inlet of the sea occupying the now agricultural area of the lower Scamander River. Troy was founded as an apparently maritime city on the shore of this inlet, which persisted throughout the early layers and was present to a lesser degree, farther away, subsequently. The harbor at Troy, however, was always small, shallow, and partially blocked by wetlands. It was never a \"great harbor\" able to collect maritime traffic through the Dardanelles.<ref>{{harvnb|Kayan|2003|pp=400-401}}</ref> The current water table depends on the degree of irrigation of the now agricultural lands. Trench flooding has slowed investigation of the lower levels in the lower city.\n\nThe whole course of archaeological investigation at Troy has resulted in no single chronological table of layers. Moreover, due to limitations on the accuracy of C<sub>14</sub> dating, the tables remain relative; i.e., absolute, or calendar dates, cannot be precisely assigned. In regions of the Earth where both history and C<sub>14</sub> dating are available, there is often a gap between them, termed by Renfrew a chronological or archaeological \"fault line.\" The two models, historical and archaeological, do not correspond, just as the contexts on either side of a geologic fault line do not correspond. \"This line divides all Europe except the Aegean from the Near East.\"<ref>{{cite journal | first=Jak | last=Yakar | title=Troy and Anatolia Early Bronze Age Chronology | journal=Anatolian Studies | volume=29 | year=1979 | page=52| doi=10.2307/3642730 | jstor=3642730 }}</ref> \n\n=== Table of layers ===\n[[File:Section Troy-Hisarlik-de.svg|thumb|300px|left|Representation of a cross-section of the mound of Hisarlik showing the relationship between the fortifications and the layers.]]\nThe table below concentrates on two systems of dates: Blegen's from ''Troy and the Trojans'',<ref name=bleg174/><ref group=note>The table only covers the Bronze Age.

Korfmann reproduces a table by Justus Cobet in ''[[Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|Neuer Pauly]]'' purporting to compare the chronologies of Schliemann, D\u0151rpfeld, Blegen and himself, with a statement of the general periods. One limitation of the table is that its dates do not recognize the changing views of those archaeologists; Korfmann himself in the text presents additional material. This article only relies on the Korfmann column of Cobet's table; Blegen's latest chronology is from another source.</ref> \n\nPrior to Korfmann's excavations, the nine-layer model was considered comprehensive of all the material at Troy. Korfmann discovered that the city was not placed on virgin soil, as Schliemann had concluded. There is no reason not to think that, in the areas he tested, Schliemann did find that Troy I was on virgin soil. Korfmann discovered a layer previous to Troy I under a gate to Troy II. He dated it 3500 BC to 2920 BC, but did not assign a name. The current director of excavation at Troy, R\u00fcstem Aslan, is calling it Troy 0 (zero).<ref>{{cite web | title=Ancient city of Troy likely founded 600 years earlier than thought | website=Daily Sabah History | location=Istanbul | date=9 January 2019 | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2019/08/21/ancient-city-of-troy-likely-founded-600-years-earlier-than-thought}}</ref> Roman numerals have no zero, but zero is one number less than I. \n\nTroy 0 has been omitted from the table below, due to the uncertainty of its general status. Archaeologists at the site before Korfmann had thought that Troy I began with the Bronze Age at 3000 BC. Troy zero is before this date. The remains of the layer are not very substantial. Whether the layer is to be counted as part of the preceding Chalcolithic, or whether the dates of the Bronze Age are to be changed, has not been decided through the regular channel of journal articles. One 2016 PhD Thesis complained: \"... the stratigraphic sequence of the renewed excavations is presented differently by different collaborators of Korfmann ... So, until an agreed stratigraphy of Korfmann\u2019s cycle is published, the employment of Troy as a yardstick for the whole of the Anatolian EBA remains problematic.\"<ref>{{cite thesis | last=Massa |first=Michele  | year=2016 |title=Networks before Empires: cultural transfers in west and central Anatolia during the Early Bronze Age |type=PhD | location=London| publisher=Institute of Archaeology University College |url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1478344/43/Massa_Thesis_combined.pdf |access-date=23 January 2020 | page=37 }}</ref><ref group=note>Not long after the beginning of the new excavations, Rose, anticipating that the dates were going to change, published some new chronological boundaries for Troy VIII-IX: {{cite book | first=C.B. | last=Rose | chapter=The 1991 Post-Bronze Age excavations at Troia | title=Studia Troica | volume=2 | year=1992 | page=44 n. 16}} This article prefers the dates published by Korfmann after his excavations had had more of a chance to mature. Unforunately a final solidification and publication was prevented by his untimely death of natural causes.</ref>\n\nFor example, in {{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=31}} Korfmann elaborates beyond the chronology of Cobet's table to make new proposals regarding the layer, Troy VIIa (which he also presents in the ''Guidebook''): \"Troia VIIa should be assigned culturally to\nTroia VI,\" asserting that \"there were no substantial differences in the material culture between the two periods.\" He suggests that D\u0151rpfeld's classification of the material subsequently in VIIa as VIi should be restored, claiming that, regarding the details, Blegen had been \"entirely in agreement\" even though his chronology featured Troy VIIa.<ref name=seven group=note>Korfmann's interpreation of the archaeological events is \"At the\nend of VIi there is a break, probably caused by war, followed by VIj \u2013 a brief phase\nin ruins. Then again a break shows up, this time a more pronounced one, with\nVIIb2, caused by people who evidently came from the north-eastern Balkans.\" This view implicitly leaves room for the 10th year of the Trojan War and the arrival of the Phrygians, or proto-Armenians, who were shortly to overrun Anatolia, displacing the Hittites.</ref> He then laments \"the old terminology has, unfortunately, been retained. Confusion is to be avoided at all costs.\" As this view has not yet been tested in the journals and is not universal, it is mainly omitted from the table (Cobet's chart, however, includes Korfmann's VIIb 3.) This new and yet unresolved material, including Troy Zero, may, however, be included in the sections and links below reporting on specific layers\n\nKorfmann also found that Troy IX was not the end of the settlements. Regardless of whether the city was abandoned at 450 AD, a population was back for the Middle Ages, which, for those times, was under the Byzantine Empire. As with Troy Zero, no conventional scholarly classification has been tested in the journals. The literature mentions Troy X, and even Troy XI, without solid definition. The table below therefore omits them.\n\nThe sequence of archaeological layering at one site evidences the relative positions of the corresponding periods at that site; however, these layers often have a position relative to periods at other sites. It is possible to define relative periods over a wide region of sites and for a larger slice of time. Determining wider correspondences is a major objective of archaeology. The establishment of a \"yardstick,\" or reliable sequence, such as the elusive one mentioned above, is a desirable outcome of archaeological analysis.\n\nThe table below states the broader connections under \"General Period.\" It references primarily the chronologies presented in the educational site created and maintained by Jeremy Rutter and team and published by [[Dartmouth College]], entitled ''Aegean Prehistoric Archaeology''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Rutter | first=Jeremy | title=The Chronology and Terminology of Aegean Prehistory | website=Chronology Overview | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=67 | accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref><ref group=note>The term \"Aegean\" has been used in recent times to mean the set of correlatable sites found in the Eastern and Central Mediterranean regions, which influenced each other through contacts established in and around the [[Aegean Sea]].

During the [[Bronze Age]], the site seems to have been a flourishing mercantile city, since its location allowed for complete control of the [[Dardanelles]], through which every merchant ship from the [[Aegean Sea]] heading for the [[Black Sea]] had to pass. Cities to the east of Troy were destroyed, and although Troy was not burned, the next period shows a change of culture indicating a new people had taken over Troy.<ref name=\"Mellaart\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/500459 |last=Mellaart |first=James |date=January 1958 |title=The end of the early Bronze Age in Anatolia and the Aegean |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201333 |jstor=500459 }}</ref> The first phase of the city is characterized by a smaller citadel, around 300&nbsp;ft in diameter, with 20 rectangular houses surrounded by massive walls, towers, and gateways.<ref name=\":0\" /> Troy II doubled in size and had a lower town and the upper citadel, with the walls protecting the upper acropolis which housed the [[megaron]]-style palace for the king.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard T.|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2012|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|pages=21}}</ref> The second phase was destroyed by a large fire, but the Trojans rebuilt, creating a fortified citadel larger than Troy II, but which had smaller and more condensed houses, suggesting an economic decline.<ref name=\":0\" /> This trend of making a larger circuit, or extent of the walls, continued with each rebuild, for Troy III, IV, and V.

Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate, a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos.<ref>{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=75}}</ref> This gate, as he describes, was the gate that Homer had featured. As Schliemann states in his publication ''Troja'':\n\"I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city, destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe, which had on the hill of Hisarl\u0131k only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices, southerly, and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium; and that, consequently, this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=277}}</ref>Also, he uncovered what he referred to as The Palace of Priam, after the king during the Trojan War.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Troy and Its Remains|last=Schliemann|first=Heinrich|publisher=Benjamin Blom, Inc.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This reference is incorrect because Priam lived nearly a thousand years after Troy II.\n\n=== Troy VI and VII ===\n[[File:Ajax suicide BM F480.jpg|thumb|The suicide of Ajax (from a [[krater|calyx-krater]], 400\u2013350 BC, [[Vulci]])]]\n\n{{Main|Troy VII}}\nTroy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC, probably by an [[earthquake]]. Only a single arrowhead was found in this layer, and no remains of bodies. However, the town quickly recovered and was rebuilt in a layout that was more orderly. This rebuild continued the trend of having a heavily fortified citadel to preserve the outer rim of the city in the face of earthquakes and sieges of the central city.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTroy VI can be characterized by the construction of the pillars at the south gate. There appears to be no structural use for the pillars. The pillars have an altar-like base and an impressive magnitude. This provides some clues, and they most likely were used as a symbol for the religious cults of the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=W. F.

This pottery suggests that during Troy IV, the Trojans still had trade with the Greeks and the Aegean. Furthermore, there were cremation burials discovered 400m south of the citadel wall. This provided evidence of a small lower city south of the Hellenistic city walls. Although the size of this city is unknown due to erosion and regular building activities, there is significant evidence that was uncovered by Blegen in 1953 during an excavation of the site. This evidence included settlements just above bedrock and a ditch thought to be used for defense. Furthermore, the small settlement itself, south of the wall, could have also been used as an obstacle to defend the main city walls and the citadel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Easton|first=D.F.|last2=Hawkins|first2=J.D.|last3=Sherratt|first3=A.G.|last4=Sherratt|first4=E.S.|date=December 2002|title=Troy in recent perspective|journal=Anatolian Studies|volume=52|pages=75\u2013109|doi=10.2307/3643078|issn=0066-1546|jstor=3643078}}</ref>\n\nThe topic still under debate is whether Troy was primarily an Anatolian-oriented or Aegean-oriented metropolis. While it is true that the city would have had a presence in the Aegean,  pottery finds and architecture strongly hint at an Anatolian orientation. Only about one percent of the pottery discovered during excavation of Troy VI was Mycenaean. The large walls and gates of the city are closely related to many other Anatolian designs. Furthermore, the practice of cremation is Anatolian. Cremation is never seen in the Mycenaean world. Anatolian hieroglyphic writing along with bronze seals marked with Anatolian hieroglyphic Luwian were also uncovered in 1995. These seals have been seen in approximately 20 other Anatolian and Syrian cities from the time (1280 - 1175 BC).<ref name=\"Korfmann 1998 369\">{{Cite journal|last=Korfmann|first=Manfred|date=1998|title=Troia, an Ancient Anatolian Palatial and Trading Center: Archaeological Evidence for the Period of Troia VI/VII|journal=The Classical World|volume=91|issue=5|pages=369\u2013385|doi=10.2307/4352105|issn=0009-8418|jstor=4352105}}</ref>\n\nStill, Troy VI was dominated by long distance trade. Troy VI during the height of its establishment held anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people. At its time, Troy would have been a large and significant city.<ref name=\"Korfmann 1998 369\"/> The location of Troy was extremely practical in the Early Bronze Age (2000\u20131500 BC). It acted as a middle ground for long distance trade with regions as far distant as Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic region, Egypt, and the western Mediterranean in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.  Earlier trade connections during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages provided Troy VI with favorable power in the long distance trade industry of the region. The amount of objects thought to be going through Troy VI would have been quite large, obtaining metals from the east and various objects from the west including perfumes and oils. This is known due to the findings of hundreds of shipwrecks off the Turkish coast. Found in these ships was an abundance of goods. Some of these ships carried over 15 tons in goods. The goods discovered in these wrecks included copper ingots, tin ingots, glass ingots, bronze tools and weapons, ebony and ivory, ostrich egg shells, jewelry and large amounts of pottery from across the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Kolb 577\u2013613\">{{Cite journal|last=Kolb|first=Frank|date=October 2004|title=Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City?|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=108|issue=4|pages=577\u2013613|doi=10.3764/aja.108.4.577|issn=0002-9114}}</ref> &nbsp;\n\nThere have been 210 shipwrecks discovered in the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age. Of these 210, 63 were discovered off the Turkish coastline. This provides a great deal of evidence for Troy VI being a prominent trading center for the region. But, the evidence at the site of Troy itself is minimal. Looking at the layers of Troy VI, we discover that there is little documentation of the excavation of this layer, and little documentation of the goods discovered in this layer. We also know that there were few trading centers during the Late Bronze Age. This is due to the low volume of trade during this period. The trading centers would have most likely been directly along trade routes. Troy is just north of most major long-distance trade routes. It may be unfair to classify Troy VI as a trading center but we do know that Troy VI was a prominent metropolis that did contribute to the trade of the region.<ref name=\"Kolb 577\u2013613\"/>\n\nTroy VIIa can be highlighted by most of the population of Troy moving within the walls of the Citadel. This is most likely due to the threat from the Mycenaeans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Charles Brian|date=1998|title=Troy and the Historical Imagination|journal=The Classical World|volume=91|issue=5|pages=405\u2013413|doi=10.2307/4352107|issn=0009-8418|jstor=4352107}}</ref> Troy VI is believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake.

It was not until the need to close \"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" arose\u2014from D\u00f6rpfeld's discovery of Troy VI\u2014that archaeology turned away from Schliemann's Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=142}}.</ref>\n\n\"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" (1800\u2013800 BC) was a period not accounted for by Schliemann's archaeology and thus constituted a hole in the Trojan timeline. In Homer's description of the city, a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest.<ref>Homer. \"Iliad\". XVI,</ref> During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall, D\u00f6rpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=89}}.</ref> D\u00f6rpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer's city, and now he would excavate the city itself. Within the walls of this stratum (Troy VI), much [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] pottery dating from [[Late Helladic]] (LH) periods III A and III B (c. 1400\u2013c. 1200 BC) was uncovered, suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans. The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the \"Great Tower of Ilios\".<ref>Homer. \"Iliad\". VI, 386</ref>\n\nThe evidence seemed to indicate that D\u00f6rpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios, the city of Homer's epics. Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city, but he never published anything stating so.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=143}}.</ref> The only counter-argument, confirmed initially by D\u00f6rpfeld (who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy), was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake, not by men.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=228}}.</ref> There was little doubt that this was the Troy of which the Mycenaeans would have known.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=223}}.</ref>\n\n== Historical Troy ==\nThe archaeologists of Troy concerned themselves mainly with [[prehistory]]; however, not all the archaeology performed there falls into the category of [[prehistoric archaeology]]. Troy VIII and Troy IX are dated to historical periods. [[Historical archaeology]] illuminates [[history]]. In the LBA records mentioning Troy begin to appear in other cultures. This type of evidence is termed [[protohistory]]. The literary characters and events must be classified as [[legend|legendary]]. Prehistoric Troy is also legendary Troy. The legends are not history or protohistory, as they are not records. It was the question of their historicity that attracted the interest of such archaeologists as Calvert and Schliemann. After many decades of archaeology, there are still no answers. There is still a \"fault line\" between history or legend and archaeology.\n\n=== Troy in Late Bronze Age Hittite and Egyptian records ===\nIf Homeric Troy is not a fantasy woven in the 8th century by Greek oral poets passing on a tradition of innovating new poems at festivals, as most archaeologists hoped it was not, then the question must be asked, what archaeological level represents Homeric Troy? Only two credible answers are available, which are the same answer: Troy VIIa in the Blegen scheme,<ref>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=164}}</ref> identical to Troy VIi in the scheme suggested by Korfmann.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=110}}</ref> After an earthquake brought down the walls of the city at its floruit about 1300 BC, the same people rebuilt the city even more magnificent than before. This event is considered the start of the LBA, and Homeric Troy is considered to be LBA Troy.\n\nBoth Blegen and Korfmann endorse a starting date of about 1300 BC. Blegen has it ending early at 1260 BC,<ref group=note>Before Korfmann began excavation again at Troy there was a movement to bring the date of the war up to 1100 BC by postulating that it happened at the end of Troy VIIb2: {{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=25-26|loc=Sinclair Hood, \"The Bronze Age Context of Homer\"}}. As justification, correlations were made to LHIIIC pottery at Pylos, rather than to the LHIIIB pottery Blegen had assumed was synchronous. Korfmann, however, found Balkan-type pottery in VIIb, suggesting an occupation by people from the Balkans. He changed the end date of VIIa to the end of the century and then decided to go back to D\u00f6rpfeld's late Troy VI.</ref> but Korfmann runs it up to 1190 BC (or 1180 BC elsewhere). He abolishes VIIa, and substitutes for it VIi, more in keeping with the splendor of VI; after all, they were the same people. He estimates the population at 10,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|pp=59-60}}</ref> The end of the period is marked by weapons left laying around, skeletons, and burnt objects, considered the result of the Trojan War. Coincidentally this is the very period referenced by Egyptian and Hittite records of Troy. They hold out some hope of a protohistorical connection.\n\nIn the 1920s, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scholar [[Emil Forrer]] proposed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=34\u201335|loc=Mellink, \"Homer, Lycia, and Lukka\"}}</ref> He further noted that the name of [[Alaksandu]], a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty, is quite similar to Homer's [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], whose birthname was Alexandros. These identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable. However, [[Trevor Bryce]] championed them in his 1998 book ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'', citing a piece of the [[Manapa-Tarhunda letter]] referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River (the classical [[Caicus]] and modern [[Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay]]) and near the land of \"Lazpa\" ([[Lesbos]]). \n\nThe excavation of the lower city uncovered a water distribution system containing {{convert|160|m|ft}} of tunnels tapping sources higher up on the ridge. Dates from the floor deposits obtained by the [[Uranium-thorium dating]] method indicate that water was flowing through the tunnels \"as early as the third millenium BC;\" thus the early city made sure that it had an internal water supply.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=112}}</ref> In 1280 BC a treaty between the reigning monarchs of the Hittite and Trojan states, Muwatalli II and Alaksandu of Wilusa respectively, invoked the water god, KASKAL_KUR, who was associated with an underground tunnel, adding weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy.\n \nAmong the documents mentioning Troy are the [[Tawagalawa letter]] ([[Catalogue des Textes Hittites|CTH]] 181) was found to document an unnamed Hittite king's correspondence to the king of the [[Ahhiyawa]], referring to an earlier \"Wilusa episode\" involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa. The Hittite king was long held to be [[Mursili II]] (c.&nbsp;1321\u20131296), but, since the 1980s, his son [[Hattusili III]] (1265\u20131240) is commonly preferred, although his other son [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] (c.&nbsp;1296\u20131272) remains a possibility.\n\nInscriptions of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] also record a nation T-R-S as one of the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|XX Dynasties]]. An inscription at [[Deir el-Medina]] records a victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the Sea Peoples, including one named \"Tursha\" (Egyptian: [''twr\u01613'']). It is probably the same as the earlier \"Teresh\" (Egyptian: [''tr\u0161.w'']) on the [[Merneptah Stele|stele]] commemorating [[Merneptah]]'s victory in a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] campaign around 1220&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer's [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion. That agrees with [[Metrical foot|metrical]] evidence in the [[Iliad]] that the name \u1fbd\u0399\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Ilion) for Troy was formerly \u03dc\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Wilion) with a [[digamma]].<ref name=met group=note>\"Metrical evidence\" is a specialized term from the study of Greek poetry. Where English poetry constructs its metric feet from emphasized and unemphasized syllables:\"Listen my children and you shall hear ...,\" ancient Greek uses long and short syllables, the length being determined according to the sequence of long and short vowels and clusters of consonants. Homer wrote his poetry in dactylic hexameter: \"Menin aeide thea ....\" From the fact that some syllables are treated as long when they should be short leads the linguists to conclude that an initial \"w\" was dropped at some time after composition: Ilion for former Wilion.</ref>\n\n=== The language culture of Troy ===\nFrom the beginning of the archaeology, the question of what language was spoken by the Trojans was prominent. Various proposals were made, but they remained pure speculation. No evidence seemed to have survived whatever. That they might be Greek was considered. However, if they were, the question of why they were not in the Achaean domain, but were opposed to the Achaeans. was an even greater mystery. Passages from the ''Iliad'' suggested that, not only were the Trojans not Greek, but the army defending Troy was composed of different language speakers arrayed by nationality.<ref>{{harvnb|Watkins|1986|pp=51-52}}. They did not speak the same language, based on ''Iliad'' II 803-804 and IV 437-438. In IV 433-435 they seem to the Greeks like a flock of bleating sheep. Hektor's battle cry was \"Trojans, Lykians, and Dardanians!\" Watkins adds, \"The epic convention is, of course, that the Trojans spoke Greek....\"</ref>\n\nFinally in the middle of the 20th century [[Linear B]] was deciphered and a large number of documentary tablets were able to be read. The language is an early dialect of Greek, even earlier than the Homeric dialect. Many Greek words were in the early stage of formation. The digamma abounds. Linear B tablets have been found at the major centers of the Achaean domain. None, however, come from Troy. \n\nThe documents in Linear B basically inventory the assets of Mycenaean palace-states: foods, textiles, ceramics, weapons, lands, and above all manpower, especially people held in some sort of servitude. Civilizations of the times were slave societies. The terms of servitude, however, varied widely. A study by Efkleidou in 2004 detailed the types of servitude mentioned in the Linear B tablets. To her way of thinking, the main elements of servitude are that servants are outsiders, not part of the customary social structure, and that they are coerced into their positions. Someone has authority over them, whom she calls a \"superior,\" designated in Greek by the genitive case: \"servant of ....\" One of the categories of Mycenaean servant is the do-er-o (masc) and do-er-a (fem), Greek doulos, pl douloi, and doula, pl doulai.<ref>{{harvnb|Efkleidou|2004|pp=59-62}}</ref> A specific type of doulos is the te-o-jo do-er-o, theoio doulos, \"servant of God,\" a temple assistant of some sort, whose superior was the deity. These two categories were not badly off, being palace artisans, and receiving land for their services. In addition were the ra-wi-ja-ja, the lawiaiai, \"captives.\" These were kept in groups and performed what would be termed today \"factory work.\" The tablets, being ephemeral in nature, do not always classify these types, but they are detectable from the naming conventions, or lack of them, and the type of work. Efkleidou uses the term \"dependent.\" In all she tallied 5233 dependents in the tablets.\n\nPerhaps most relevant to the times are named groups of women, the group name being an ethnic or a craft name. One such group called just \"captives\" gives a hint to their class of servitude. The ethnic names show that western Anatolia and the islands off it are being favored.<ref group=note>The relevant groups are: 7 women from [[Lemnos]] (ra-mi-ni-ja), 6 or 7 from Chios (ki-si-wi-je), 35 from Asia (a-*64-ja), 26 from the vicinity of [[Halicarnassus]] (ze-ru2-ra3), 70 from Miletus (mi-ra-ti-ja).</ref> Other groups implicitly from the region are named after the type of work they do, especially the textile workers: finishers, spinners, and a group of flax handlers (ri-ne-ja, or lineiai) composed of 82 women with 61 female children and 56 male. Other groups are male bronzesmiths, house and ship builders.<ref>{{harvnb|Efkleidou|2004|pp=104-119}}</ref>  The majority of the females were textile workers, a development foreshadowed in the initial scene of the ''Iliad'', in which the priest, Chryses, entreats Agamemnon to ransom his daughter, Chryseis, only to be refused with the statement that she would be frequenting his bed and working his loom far away in Argos.\n\nIn the tablets, the coast of Anatolia is under attack by Mycenaean centers of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], especially the center at [[Pylos]] (pu-ro). Since the tablets, which were manufactured ad hoc of fresh clay and immediately engraved with writing, only survived by being baked in the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|fires that destroyed the palaces]], their dates depend on the those dates of destruction. The Pylos tablets record the dispatch of a fleet of \"rowers\" and soldiers under a \"commander\" to the [[Gulf of Corinth]], and then the palace is gone, burned in its own oil. If pu-ro is the Homeric Pylos, then the date is after the Trojan War, as the legendary Pylos survived it intact. None of the names of the important men at these centers are anything like the names of the Homeric legends. Presumably, the latter had all died in their time and had been replaced by men unknown to legend, but profiting from the fall of Troy. A second possibility would be that the legends are totally imaginary, contrary to the hopes and expectations of the first archaeologists.\n\nThis time between the Trojan War and the burning of the palaces fits into another historical period, the time of the [[Sea Peoples]]. These were ethnicities from Achaea, Dardania, Etruria, Sicilia, Sardinia, and elsewhere, who, abandoning the norms of civilization, took to a life of marauding and piracy, disrupting trade, transportation, peace, and security. They placed colonies as bases.<ref group=note>The earliest historical view is that these people were transitioning from somewhere else to their classical locations, pushed by the southward movement of Balkan peoples. The main problem with the theory is that the \"somewhere else\"s were not locateable. The classification of many of them as archaeologically indigenous to their known native lands reduced their appearances in the Mediterranean to mere opportunistic expeditions.</ref> The eastern Mediterranean became a wilderness. Cities withdrew from the coast. Isolation set in.\n\nSurprisingly, Trojan names began turning up in the archives of ancient Pylos, capital of the legendary [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]. They were of persons kept in a servile capacity, from which the universal conclusion was that they were descended from slaves taken at Troy. Etymological analysis by linguists revealed that they were not native Greek names, suggesting that the Trojans were not Greek.\n\nA theory began to gain influence based on the [[Aeneid]] that the Trojans were Etruscan.<ref group=note>Statements of ancient authors on the origin of the Etruscans are contradictory. [[Herodotus]] stated that, under the name [[Tyrrhenians|Tursenoi]], they came from [[Lydia]]. Equating Tursenoi with Trojan, early scholars of the Etruscans presumed that, regardless of what language was spoken at Troy, Aeneas represented an Etruscan component. Aeneas, however, landed in Latium, whereas the Etruscans dwelled in Tuscany, North Italy, and northeast Italy. It was necessary to hypothesize a priori that Etruscan civilization spread from Latium to the rest of its range. This point of view has been called \"the Herodotean.\" The discovery that Lydian is Anatolian dampened the theory somewhat but hold-outs insist on a backland between the Hittites and coastal Luwians where such a pocket could exist, no matter how small the numbers.</ref> This theory purported to explain how the Etruscans arrived in Italy. During the 20th century, however, Etruscan archaeology investigated thousands of Etruscan sites over most of Italy, except for the Greek regions in south Italy and the Italic regions of central Italy. Moreover, Etruscan inscriptions were found in at least one valley leading to a pass over the Alps. The sites dated as early as the Bronze Age. It was soon clear that the theory of a general Etruscan migration from Troy to most of Italy was the least likely scenario.<ref group=note>Italian archaeologists were the first major group of scholars to reject the Herodotean view. Etruscan civilzation, they said, was indigenous to Italy, from which it spread to colonies in the Mediterranean as part of its merchant activities. The Italian point of view can be found in {{cite thesis |last=Forte |first=Valeria | date=December 2008 | title=Archaeology and Nationalism: The Trojan Legend in Etruria  | type=MA | chapter=4.3 Etruscan Origins: Discrepancies in Texts | publisher=The University of Texas at Arlington | chapter-url=https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/1819/Forte_uta_2502M_10074.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y | access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> The Etruscan theory died slowly. Its advocates looked for hidden pockets of Etruscans in the backlands of Anatolia and looked for hope in some shallow genetic studies purporting to relate the inhabitants of Tuscany to the inhabitants of Turkey.<ref group=note>In the early 21st century attempts were made to gauge the relatedness of modern Tuscan and Anatolian populations by comparing samples of their [[Mitochondrial DNA]]. Some links were found, which were used to support conclusions that the Etruscans came from Anatolia and were also related to the Turks. A recent review of these studies using [[Approximate Bayesian computation]] (methods of statistics) found that the conclusions were not warranted by the comparisons, as certain untrue assumptions had been made. The Tuscan and Anatolian populations had been assumed to be relatively closed; i.e., descended from ancestors also dwelling there. A comparison of the Tuscans with the Etruscans (known from their tombs) indicated the modern was not generally related to the ancient; i.e., the ancient Etruscans had been replaced and their descendants were not to be found except in isolated cases. Anatolia also had received immigrants from many different locations. Calculating the probability that ancient Etruscans could have come from Anatolia, the authors found \"the observed genetic similarities between modern Tuscans and Anatolians cannot be attributed to an immigration wave from the East leading to the onset of the\nEtruscan culture in Italy.\" The only model to account for the sparse similarities would have to be pushed back to the migrations of the Neolithic. {{cite journal | title=Genetic Evidence Does Not Support an Etruscan Origin in Anatolia | author1=Francesca Tassi | author2=Silvia Ghirotto | author3=David Caramelli | author4=Guido Barbujani | journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology | number=152 | pages=11\u201318 | year=2013 | url=http://www.guidobarbujani.it/images/Publications/Tassi-AJPA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile a greater question came to the fore. Throughout the Bronze Age the greatest power in Anatolia was the Hittites, with capital in central Anatolia. Why were there no links to them? How could the coastal states have avoided them? Anatolian studies expanded in the late 20th century. Those states had not avoided them, they were subject to them. Previously unknown scripts were found to be in Anatolian languages. The dominant one on the coast was [[Luwian]]. In the Luwian range west of the Hittite capital there was no room for any Etruscans. Whatever he was, Aeneas was not Etruscan, and whatever the ancestry of the imperial family at Rome was, which knew Etruscan and was counted as Tuscan, it derived no authority from ancient Troy.\n\nThe 1995 discovery of a [[Luwian]] biconvex seal at Troy sparked heated debate over the [[Trojan language|language that was spoken in Homeric Troy]]. Frank Starke of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] argued that the name of [[Priam]], king of Troy at the time of the [[Trojan War]], is related to the Luwian compound ''Priimuua'', which means \"exceptionally courageous\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Starke |first=Frank |title=Troia im Kontext des historisch-politischen und sprachlichen Umfeldes Kleinasiens im 2. Jahrtausend |journal=Studia Troica |year=1997 |volume=7 |pages=447\u201387}}</ref> Starke adds: \"The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community,\" although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.<ref>{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=116}}</ref>. The tablet was discovered in the lower city, archaeologically out of the way until now, but undoubtedly more populous and frequented than the citadel. It is possible that the major archive site has yet to be discovered at Troy, if any survived.\n\n=== Dark Age Troy ===\n[[File:Troy (Ilion), Turkey (7446237818).jpg|thumb|300px|Anatolian Grey Ware]]\nB.W. Fortson, IV, defines the [[Greek Dark Ages]] as \"The period from the demise of Mycenaean civilization to the earliest appearance of alphabetic Greek in the eighth century ....\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction | first=Benjamin W., IV | last=Fortson | edition=Second | location=Chichester, UK | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2010 | page=249}}</ref> The idea is that in the breakdown of peace and stability suffered by the Mycenaean kingdoms they entered a period of fear, isolation, and economic depression in which their writing system was lost causing a subsequent deficit of written records, interpreted by later historians as \"darkness.\" The view is too simple, however.\n\nWhile it is true that the palaces were destroyed by fire, it is untrue that they were all burned in the same year or even the same decade by a single wave of [[Dorian invasion|Dorian tribes]] from the region later known as [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. The dates of the destructions differ by as much as a generation. Chadwick asks, \"... where were all the Dorians during the Mycenaean period? And why were they content to wait in the wings until the time was right for this intrusion?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=192-193}}</ref> His own theory was that the Mycenaeans were incendiary to each other's palaces in a rash of infradynastic conflicts. These would have occupied the entire 11th century BC. There was no sudden influx of all the Dorians in one great invasion, but rather an insistent occupation of the Peloponnesus over a century or more. It has to be counted as Dorian from the 10th century BC on. Most of the former Achaean inhabitants escaped to the now depopulated coast of Anatolia as [[Ionians]] and [[Aeolians]]. Athens remained firm.\n\nAmong the Achaeans of [[Cyprus]], on the edge of the Greek world, writing failed to disappear. They continued to write their own conservative dialect, [[Arcadocypriot Greek]], in a few scripts of [[Cypriote syllabary]], which they had innovated on the model of Linear A and Linear B They were fairly isolated from their former homeland by the spread of Dorians to Crete, the southern Cyclades, and southern Anatolia. When the concept of a Greek alphabet arrived, they innovated with the Phoenician alphabet to make it fit their language, and the two systems continued side-by-side until Hellenistic times, when Attic became the common dialect. Meanwhile their dialect continued in the hills of [[Arcadia]], but it had no writing system there. This dark age interlude in Greece is not generally interpreted as a return to prehistoric times. It is a historic age with gaps in its history, which is how the archaeologists treat it.\n\nIn both Blegen and Korfmann, Homeric Troy ends at the end of Blegen's Troy VIIa, Korfmann's VIi, with the burning of the city, presumably by Achaeans. Legend has the Trojans vanishing away, either escaping, as did Aeneas and his very large band, being slaughtered, as were Priam and his wife, or being carted off into slavery, as were the literary Trojan women. Apparently, no Trojans seem to have been left. Their enemies would have cleared them entirely away, leaving the ruined city vacant and non-dangerous.\n\nThe archaeology suggests that the literary implication of a deserted city is probably not true. After a suitable interval of hiding somewhere else in the region, perhaps with the Dardanians, who were not defeated, but appeared as marauders among the sea peoples, or further inland with the Hittites, the Trojan remnants returned to Troy to rebuild Troy VIIb, which, according to Blegen, \"... obviously represents a direct survival of the culture that prevailed in Troy VIIa.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=165}}</ref> The initial VIIb period is VIIb1, which Korfmann suggests should be VIj.<ref>{{harvnb|Korfmann|2013|p=60}}</ref> and regards as \"transitional to the Early Iron Age.\" As yet, however, it is contemporary with LHIIIC (LBA) pottery on the mainland. The reconstruction does not appear to have been opposed by the palaces, such as at Pylos, which were still standing. The return to a simpler pottery causes Korfmann to hypothesize a \"humble folk\" investment of the ruins.\n\nTroy VIIb2 begins contemporaneously with LHIIIC, but at about 1050 BC the last of IIIC disappears, to be replaced by [[Sub-Mycenaean pottery]], a short-lived Mycenaean-like pottery with geometric motifs, considered transitional to [[Geometric art|Geometric pottery]], the ware characteristic everywhere in the Greek world of the [[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Age]]. The palaces can be counted as vanished, as the last pottery at Pylos was LH IIIC. Apparently, the city of the \"humble Trojans\" could not maintain itself, but was overrun or replaced. The latter part of Troy IIIb2 sees the replacement of their pottery with wares, such as \"Knobbed Ware,\" characteristic of the Balkan-Black Sea region. The Luwian seal presents a problem, as it is dated Troy VIIb2. Luwian speakers would not have been as far away as the northern Black Sea. If the seal is from early VIIb2, however, it can represent the last of the Luwian speakers at Troy. A mixed culture was certainly possible. Priam's wife, Hecuba, had been a Phrygian.\n\nBlegen ends his tale of Troy VII with VIIb2 around 1100 BC. The city was burned one last time, an event contemporaneous with the general destruction of the Mycenaean palaces. This would be the ethnical end of the Trojans at Troy by abandonment, but Blegen has a final suggestion. Troy VI was characterized by what Blegen calls \"Grey Minyan Ware,\" now Anatolian [[Minyan ware]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Pav\u00fak|first=Peter|title=Grey Wares as a Phenomenon|publisher=Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory|date=12 June 2007|url=http://www.aegeobalkanprehistory.net/article.php?id_art=5|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225120242/http://www.aegeobalkanprehistory.net/article.php?id_art=5|archivedate=25 December 2008}}</ref><ref group=note>The term Minyan Ware refers to any grey-to-black, burnished, undecorated pottery of simple shapes, such as bowls, of any time or location. Now that the non-destructive scientific ability exists to analyze the clay and identify the clay beds by the composition of the pots, \"Minyan Ware\" is further qualified by an adjective stating its provenience; hence \"Anatolian Minyan Ware,\" which can only have been made in Anatolia.</ref> or Anatolian Grey Ware. After the abandonment of the city, the ware appears in the highlands, leading Blegen to conjecture that the Trojans gradually withdrew in that direction.\n\nThe more recent excavations turned up additional information. In the lower city was pottery from the early and middle [[Protogeometric style|Proto-geometric period]], characteristic of the Dark Age. The Trojans may have escaped to the hills, but their burned city was occupied by their incendiary opponents, whoever they were. They brought iron with them, relying on the superior strength of iron weapons for their victory. Korfmann creates a new period for them, Troy VIIb3, 1020-950 BC.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the Iron-age people left their settlement about 950 BC, leaving it abandoned. Korfmann calls this interval a hiatus, meaning of residential occupation. A Greek colony arrived there to plant a new city about 750 BC, archaeological Troy VIII. They leveled the top of the mound to construct a temple to Athena, thus identifying themselves as being in the Attic-Ionic culture, as opposed to the Aeolic Greeks (Boeotia) who had previously been settling the north coast of Anatolia. The leveling process destroyed the previous structures at the center of the citadel. As Homeric Troy had been called \"sacred Ilium,\" Korfmann asserts that a temple district may have been maintained there during the apparent abandonment period, but whose is not known.\n\n=== Classical and Hellenistic Troy (Troy VIII) ===\nIn 480 BC, the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] sacrificed 1,000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 7.43.</ref> Following the Persian defeat in 480\u2013479, Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of [[Mytilene]] and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful [[Mytilenean revolt]] in 428\u2013427. Athens liberated the so-called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the [[Delian League]]. Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411, and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias. From c. 410\u2013399, Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at [[Lampsacus]] (Zenis, his wife Mania, and the usurper Meidias) who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap [[Pharnabazos II, Satrap of Phrygia|Pharnabazus]].\n\nIn 399, the Spartan general [[Dercylidas]] expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dynasts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad. Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at [[Dascylium]] until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387\u2013386. In this period of renewed Persian control c. 387\u2013367, a statue of [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias.<ref>Diodorus 17.17.6.</ref> In 360\u2013359 the city was briefly controlled by [[Charidemus]] of [[Oreus]], a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians.<ref>Demosthenes 23.154\u2013157; Aeneas Tacticus 24.3\u201314.</ref> In 359, he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios, whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of [[proxeny]]\u2014this is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion.<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 23.</ref> In May 334 [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Hellespont and came to the city, where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias, made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes, and made the city free and exempt from taxes.<ref>Arrian, ''Anabasis'' 1.11\u201312, Diodorus Siculus 17.17\u201318, Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'' 15, Justin 9.5.12, Strabo 13.1.26, 32.</ref> According to the so-called 'Last Plans' of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323, he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world.<ref>Diodorus 18.4.5.</ref>\n\n[[Antigonus Monophthalmus]] took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of [[Alexandria Troas|Antigoneia Troas]] which was a [[synoikism]] of the cities of [[Skepsis]], [[Cebren|Kebren]], [[Neandreia]], [[Hamaxitus|Hamaxitos]], [[Larisa (Troad)|Larisa]], and [[Kolonai]]. In c. 311\u2013306 the ''[[koinon]] ''of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the [[Dardanelles]] and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom (he had not respected the autonomy of the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia).<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 1.</ref> The ''koinon ''continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad, although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included [[Myrlea]] and [[Chalcedon]] from the eastern [[Propontis]].<ref>Myrlea and Calchedon: Inschriften von Ilion 5\u20136.</ref> The governing body of the ''koinon ''was the ''synedrion'' on which each city was represented by two delegates. The day-to-day running of the ''synedrion'', especially in relation to its finances, was left to a college of five ''agonothetai'', on which no city ever had more than one representative. This system of equal (rather than proportional) representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the ''koinon''.<ref>D.

Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade (Paris 1966) 18\u201346.</ref> In addition, the ''koinon ''financed new building projects at Ilion, for example a new theatre c. 306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century, in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival.<ref>Theatre: Inschriften von Ilion 1.

These probably included [[Birytis]], [[Gentinos]], and Sigeion: J. M. Cook, ''The Troad ''(Oxford 1973) 364. Birytis and Gentinos are not securely located, but recent excavations at Sigeion appear to independently confirm Strabo\u2019s account by indicating an abandonment date soon after c. 300: Th.

A minority of scholars instead attempt to date this inscription to the reign of Antiochus III (222\u2013187 BC).</ref> During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel, and in 278 during the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] the city was easily sacked.<ref>Strabo 13.1.27.</ref> Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign: for example, in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion, and c. 275\u2013269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle.<ref>Inschriften von Ilion 33 (Aristodikides), 34 (Metrodoros).</ref>\n\n=== Roman Troy (Troy IX) ===\nA new city called '''Ilium''' (from Greek Ilion) was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric in the [[Roman province]] [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] (civil [[Diocese of Asia]]), but declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]].\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[Sulla]]'s rival, the Roman general [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria|Fimbria]], in 85 BC following an eleven-day siege.<ref>Strabo 13.1.27, Livy, ''Periochae'' 83.</ref> Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city's rebuilding. Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year.<ref>''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.2\u20133.</ref> However, the city remained in financial distress for several decades, despite its favoured status with Rome. In the 80s BC, Roman ''publicani'' illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|L. Julius Caesar]] for restitution; while in 80 BC, the city suffered an attack by pirates.<ref>''Inchriften von Ilion'' 71 (''publicani''), 73 (pirates).</ref> In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the ''koinon'' of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the ''koinon'' and L. Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate, this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden.<ref>''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.</ref> In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general [[Lucullus]] against Mithridates VI.<ref>Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 10.3, 12.2.</ref> Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63\u201362, [[Pompey]] rewarded the city's loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias.<ref>''Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum'' 46.1565.</ref> In 48 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] likewise bestowed benefactions on the city, recalling the city's loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars, the city's connection with his cousin L. Julius Caesar, and the family's claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians.<ref>Lucan, ''Pharsalia'' 9.964\u2013999, Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 79.3.</ref>\n\nIn 20 BC, the Emperor [[Augustus]] visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen, Melanippides son of Euthydikos.<ref>Dio Cassius 54.7, ''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.</ref> As a result of his visit, he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias, the [[bouleuterion]] (council house) and the theatre.

At the top of the [[French football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. Administrated by the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]], Ligue 1 is contested by 20 clubs and operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with [[Ligue 2]].\n\nSeasons run from August to May. Clubs play two matches against each of the other teams in the league \u2013 once home and once away \u2013 totalling to 38 matches over the course of the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before [[Christmas]] for two weeks before returning in the second week of January. Ligue 1 is one of the top national leagues, currently ranked [[UEFA coefficient|fifth in Europe]] behind Spain's [[La Liga]], England's [[Premier League]], Germany's [[Bundesliga]] and Italy's [[Serie A]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA rankings for club competitions|website=[[UEFA]]|date=24 February 2018|url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nLigue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name ''National'' before switching to ''Division 1'' after a year of existence. The name lasted until 2002 before switching to its current name. [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne]] is the most successful club with ten league titles in France while [[Olympique Lyonnais]] is the club that has won the most consecutive titles (seven between 2002 and 2008). With the presence of 69 seasons in Ligue 1, [[Olympique de Marseille]] hold the record for most seasons among the elite, while [[Paris Saint-Germain]] hold the league record for longevity with 45 consecutive seasons (from 1974 until at least 2019). The current champions are [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], who won their eighth title in the [[2017\u201318 Ligue 1|2018\u201319 season]]. The league has been won on multiple occasions by foreign-based club [[AS Monaco]], which makes the league a cross-border competition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n[[Professional]]ism in [[Football in France|French football]] did not exist until July 1930, when the National Council of the [[French Football Federation]] voted 128\u201320 in favor of its adoption. The founding fathers of professionalism in French football are Georges Bayrou, Emmanuel Gambardella, and [[Gabriel Hanot]]. Professionalism was officially implemented in 1932.\n\nIn order to successfully create a professional football league in the country, the Federation limited the league to twenty clubs. In order to participate in the competition, clubs were subjected to three important criteria:\n\n* The incoming club must have had positive results in the past.\n* The incoming club must be able to pull in enough revenue to balance its finances.\n* The incoming club must be able to successfully recruit at least eight professional players.\n\nMany clubs disagreed with the subjective criteria, most notably [[Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]], [[RC Roubaix]], [[Amiens SC]], and [[Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris (football)|Stade Fran\u00e7ais]], while others like [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], due to fear of bankruptcy, and [[Olympique Lillois]], due to a [[conflict of interest]], were reluctant to become professional. Olympique Lillois' president, Henri Jooris, also chairman of the Ligue du Nord, feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned professional status, though it became more difficult to convince clubs in the northern half of the country; Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, and Amiens refused to accept the new league, while conversely [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], and [[SC Fives|Fives]] accepted professionalism. In southern France, clubs such as [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[Hy\u00e8res FC|Hy\u00e8res]], [[Montpellier HSC|SO Montpellier]], [[N\u00eemes Olympique|SC N\u00eemes]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], and [[OGC Nice|Nice]] were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their professional status without argument.\n\n===Establishment===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;font-size:90%;float:right\"\n|+ '''Division 1 champions (Pre-WWII)'''\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:125px;\"| Winner\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|1932\u201333]]\n| [[Olympique Lillois]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1933\u201334 French Division 1|1933\u201334]]\n| [[FC S\u00e8te|S\u00e8te]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1934\u201335 French Division 1|1934\u201335]]\n| [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1935\u201336 French Division 1|1935\u201336]]\n| [[Racing Club de France football Colombes 92|Racing Club de France]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1936\u201337 French Division 1|1936\u201337]]\n| [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1937\u201338 French Division 1|1937\u201338]]\n| [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1938\u201339 French Division 1|1938\u201339]]\n| [[FC S\u00e8te|S\u00e8te]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| {{further2|<br />[[List of French football champions|French football champions]]}}\n|}\n\nThe league's inaugural season of the all-professional league, called ''National'', was held in [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|1932\u20131933]]. The 20 inaugural members of ''National'' were [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], [[CA Paris-Charenton|CA Paris]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[Club Fran\u00e7ais]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[SC Fives|Fives]], [[Hy\u00e8res FC|Hy\u00e8res]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]], [[Olympique Al\u00e8s]], [[Olympique Lillois]], [[Racing Club de France football Colombes 92|Racing Club de France]], [[Red Star F.C.|Red Star Olympique]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]], [[FC S\u00e8te 34|S\u00e8te]], and [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. The 20 clubs were inserted into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face each other in a ''final'' held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir]]. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, was supposed to take part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the [[French Football Federation]] and was forced into disqualification. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club's 4\u20133 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from ''National'' to simply ''Division 1''. For the [[1934\u201335 French Division 1|1934\u201335 season]], the league organized a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the [[1938\u201339 French Division 1|1938\u201339 season]].\n\nBecause of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel, although its member clubs continued playing in regional competitions. During the \"war championships\", as they are called, professionalism was abolished by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and clubs were forced to participate in regional leagues, designated as ''Zone Sud'' and ''Zone Nord''. Due to its non-association with the two leagues, the LFP and FFF do not recognize the championships won by the clubs and thus 1939\u20131945 is non-existent in the two organizations' view. Following the conclusion of the war and the [[liberation of France]], professional football returned to France. The first division increased its allotment of clubs to 18. This number remained until the [[1965\u201366 French Division 1|1965\u201366 season]] when the number was increased to 20. In 2002, the league changed its name from ''Division 1'' to ''Ligue 1''.\n\n==Competition format==\n\nThere are 20 clubs in Ligue 1. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when [[Lille OSC|Lille]] hosted [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the [[Stade de France]] in 2007 and 2008. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. For the 2015/16 season only, 2 teams were to be relegated and only 2 teams from Ligue 2 were to be promoted but this decision was overturned and 3 teams were relegated and 3 teams promoted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ligue 1 reduces relegation spots to two|url=http://www.espnfc.us/french-ligue-1/story/2461334/ligue-1-reduces-relegation-spots-to-two| publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>\nSo it was the 2016\u201317 season which saw the return of a relegation play-off between the 18th-placed Ligue 1 team and the 3rd-placed team in the [[2016\u201317 Ligue 2|Ligue 2]] on a two-legged confrontation, with the Ligue 2 team hosting the first game.<ref>{{cite news |title=Les d\u00e9cisions du 14 avril 2016 |url=http://www.lfp.fr/corporate/article/les-decisions-du-14-avril-2016.htm | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel|lfp.fr]] |accessdate=30 April 2016 |date=14 April 2016|language = French}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, the league utilized a different promotion and relegation format. Prior to 1995, the league's format was direct relegation of the bottom two teams and a play-off between the third-last first-division team and the winner of the second-division play-offs, similar to the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], and the German [[Bundesliga]]. The league has also experimented with a \"bonus\" rule. From 1973 to 1976, a rule rewarded teams scoring three or more goals in a game with one extra point, regardless of outcome, with the objective of encouraging offensive play. The experience was ultimately inconclusive. At the start of the [[2006\u201307 Ligue 1|2006\u201307 season]], the league introduced an ''Attacking Play Table'' to encourage the scoring of more goals in Ligue 1 and [[Ligue 2]]. The LFP, with the help of the former manager [[Michel Hidalgo]] introduced the idea to reward those teams who score the most goals. The table was similar to the previous idea, but was independent from the official league table and clubs were only rewarded with monetary bonuses.\n\n===European qualification===\nAs of the 2017/18 season, as determined by the [[UEFA coefficient]], the top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], with the top two proceeding directly to the group phase. The third-placed team enters in the third qualifying round. The fourth-placed team qualifies for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The other two Europa League places are determined through the country's two domestic cup competitions, the [[Coupe de France]] and [[Coupe de la Ligue]]. If both of the cup winners qualify for Europe through their league position, the fifth- and sixth-placed teams in Ligue 1 will qualify for the Europa League.\n\n==Clubs==\n{{Main article|List of Ligue 1 clubs}}\nA total of 73 clubs have played in Ligue 1 from its foundation in the 1932\u201333 season to the start of the 2011\u201312 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bilan des clubs |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |work=Ligue de Football Professionnel |accessdate=19 March 2010 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019012700/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |archivedate=19 October 2010 }}</ref> Currently, [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] are the only founding members of the league to be playing in Ligue 1.

Ligue 1 is one of the top national leagues, currently ranked [[UEFA coefficient|fifth in Europe]] behind Spain's [[La Liga]], England's [[Premier League]], Germany's [[Bundesliga]] and Italy's [[Serie A]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA rankings for club competitions|website=[[UEFA]]|date=24 February 2018|url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nLigue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name ''National'' before switching to ''Division 1'' after a year of existence. The name lasted until 2002 before switching to its current name. [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne]] is the most successful club with ten league titles in France while [[Olympique Lyonnais]] is the club that has won the most consecutive titles (seven between 2002 and 2008). With the presence of 69 seasons in Ligue 1, [[Olympique de Marseille]] hold the record for most seasons among the elite, while [[Paris Saint-Germain]] hold the league record for longevity with 45 consecutive seasons (from 1974 until at least 2019). The current champions are [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], who won their eighth title in the [[2017\u201318 Ligue 1|2018\u201319 season]]. The league has been won on multiple occasions by foreign-based club [[AS Monaco]], which makes the league a cross-border competition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n[[Professional]]ism in [[Football in France|French football]] did not exist until July 1930, when the National Council of the [[French Football Federation]] voted 128\u201320 in favor of its adoption. The founding fathers of professionalism in French football are Georges Bayrou, Emmanuel Gambardella, and [[Gabriel Hanot]]. Professionalism was officially implemented in 1932.\n\nIn order to successfully create a professional football league in the country, the Federation limited the league to twenty clubs. In order to participate in the competition, clubs were subjected to three important criteria:\n\n* The incoming club must have had positive results in the past.\n* The incoming club must be able to pull in enough revenue to balance its finances.\n* The incoming club must be able to successfully recruit at least eight professional players.\n\nMany clubs disagreed with the subjective criteria, most notably [[Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]], [[RC Roubaix]], [[Amiens SC]], and [[Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris (football)|Stade Fran\u00e7ais]], while others like [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], due to fear of bankruptcy, and [[Olympique Lillois]], due to a [[conflict of interest]], were reluctant to become professional. Olympique Lillois' president, Henri Jooris, also chairman of the Ligue du Nord, feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned professional status, though it became more difficult to convince clubs in the northern half of the country; Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, and Amiens refused to accept the new league, while conversely [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], and [[SC Fives|Fives]] accepted professionalism. In southern France, clubs such as [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[Hy\u00e8res FC|Hy\u00e8res]], [[Montpellier HSC|SO Montpellier]], [[N\u00eemes Olympique|SC N\u00eemes]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], and [[OGC Nice|Nice]] were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their professional status without argument.\n\n===Establishment===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;font-size:90%;float:right\"\n|+ '''Division 1 champions (Pre-WWII)'''\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:125px;\"| Winner\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|1932\u201333]]\n| [[Olympique Lillois]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1933\u201334 French Division 1|1933\u201334]]\n| [[FC S\u00e8te|S\u00e8te]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1934\u201335 French Division 1|1934\u201335]]\n| [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1935\u201336 French Division 1|1935\u201336]]\n| [[Racing Club de France football Colombes 92|Racing Club de France]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1936\u201337 French Division 1|1936\u201337]]\n| [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1937\u201338 French Division 1|1937\u201338]]\n| [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1938\u201339 French Division 1|1938\u201339]]\n| [[FC S\u00e8te|S\u00e8te]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| {{further2|<br />[[List of French football champions|French football champions]]}}\n|}\n\nThe league's inaugural season of the all-professional league, called ''National'', was held in [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|1932\u20131933]]. The 20 inaugural members of ''National'' were [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], [[CA Paris-Charenton|CA Paris]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[Club Fran\u00e7ais]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[SC Fives|Fives]], [[Hy\u00e8res FC|Hy\u00e8res]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]], [[Olympique Al\u00e8s]], [[Olympique Lillois]], [[Racing Club de France football Colombes 92|Racing Club de France]], [[Red Star F.C.|Red Star Olympique]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]], [[FC S\u00e8te 34|S\u00e8te]], and [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. The 20 clubs were inserted into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face each other in a ''final'' held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir]]. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, was supposed to take part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the [[French Football Federation]] and was forced into disqualification. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club's 4\u20133 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from ''National'' to simply ''Division 1''. For the [[1934\u201335 French Division 1|1934\u201335 season]], the league organized a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the [[1938\u201339 French Division 1|1938\u201339 season]].\n\nBecause of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel, although its member clubs continued playing in regional competitions. During the \"war championships\", as they are called, professionalism was abolished by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and clubs were forced to participate in regional leagues, designated as ''Zone Sud'' and ''Zone Nord''. Due to its non-association with the two leagues, the LFP and FFF do not recognize the championships won by the clubs and thus 1939\u20131945 is non-existent in the two organizations' view. Following the conclusion of the war and the [[liberation of France]], professional football returned to France. The first division increased its allotment of clubs to 18. This number remained until the [[1965\u201366 French Division 1|1965\u201366 season]] when the number was increased to 20. In 2002, the league changed its name from ''Division 1'' to ''Ligue 1''.\n\n==Competition format==\n\nThere are 20 clubs in Ligue 1. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when [[Lille OSC|Lille]] hosted [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the [[Stade de France]] in 2007 and 2008. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. For the 2015/16 season only, 2 teams were to be relegated and only 2 teams from Ligue 2 were to be promoted but this decision was overturned and 3 teams were relegated and 3 teams promoted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ligue 1 reduces relegation spots to two|url=http://www.espnfc.us/french-ligue-1/story/2461334/ligue-1-reduces-relegation-spots-to-two| publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>\nSo it was the 2016\u201317 season which saw the return of a relegation play-off between the 18th-placed Ligue 1 team and the 3rd-placed team in the [[2016\u201317 Ligue 2|Ligue 2]] on a two-legged confrontation, with the Ligue 2 team hosting the first game.<ref>{{cite news |title=Les d\u00e9cisions du 14 avril 2016 |url=http://www.lfp.fr/corporate/article/les-decisions-du-14-avril-2016.htm | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel|lfp.fr]] |accessdate=30 April 2016 |date=14 April 2016|language = French}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, the league utilized a different promotion and relegation format. Prior to 1995, the league's format was direct relegation of the bottom two teams and a play-off between the third-last first-division team and the winner of the second-division play-offs, similar to the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], and the German [[Bundesliga]]. The league has also experimented with a \"bonus\" rule. From 1973 to 1976, a rule rewarded teams scoring three or more goals in a game with one extra point, regardless of outcome, with the objective of encouraging offensive play. The experience was ultimately inconclusive. At the start of the [[2006\u201307 Ligue 1|2006\u201307 season]], the league introduced an ''Attacking Play Table'' to encourage the scoring of more goals in Ligue 1 and [[Ligue 2]]. The LFP, with the help of the former manager [[Michel Hidalgo]] introduced the idea to reward those teams who score the most goals. The table was similar to the previous idea, but was independent from the official league table and clubs were only rewarded with monetary bonuses.\n\n===European qualification===\nAs of the 2017/18 season, as determined by the [[UEFA coefficient]], the top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], with the top two proceeding directly to the group phase. The third-placed team enters in the third qualifying round. The fourth-placed team qualifies for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The other two Europa League places are determined through the country's two domestic cup competitions, the [[Coupe de France]] and [[Coupe de la Ligue]]. If both of the cup winners qualify for Europe through their league position, the fifth- and sixth-placed teams in Ligue 1 will qualify for the Europa League.\n\n==Clubs==\n{{Main article|List of Ligue 1 clubs}}\nA total of 73 clubs have played in Ligue 1 from its foundation in the 1932\u201333 season to the start of the 2011\u201312 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bilan des clubs |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |work=Ligue de Football Professionnel |accessdate=19 March 2010 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019012700/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |archivedate=19 October 2010 }}</ref> Currently, [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] are the only founding members of the league to be playing in Ligue 1.

They earned promotion to the first division for the 1974\u201375 season and has not faltered down since. Paris Saint-Germain was administratively relegated by the league following its split from [[Paris FC]] in 1972, but returned to the top flight two seasons later.\n\nInternationally, the most well-known Ligue 1 clubs include [[Paris Saint-Germain]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]], [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[AS Monaco]], [[AS Saint-Etienne]], [[Lille OSC]] and [[Girondins de Bordeaux]].\n\n===Members for 2019\u201320===\nThe following 20 clubs will compete in the [[2019\u201320 Ligue 1]] season.\n\n{{updated|start of 2019\u20132020 Ligue 1 season}}\n\n{{Location map+ |France |width=515|float=right |caption=Location of teams in '''2019\u201320 Ligue 1''' |places=\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.892 |long=2.299 |label=<small>[[Amiens SC|Amiens]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=47.460427 |long=-0.530804 |label=<small>[[Angers SCO|Angers]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=44.896944 |long=-0.563333 |label=<small>[[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.334722 |long=-4.456444 |label=<small>[[Stade Brestois 29|Brest]]</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=47.2906   |long=5.0428    |label=<small>[[Dijon FCO|Dijon]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.621137 |long=3.157519  |label=<small>[[Lille OSC|Lille]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=45.723778 |long=4.93225   |label=<small>[[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.269806 |long=5.395922  |label=<small>[[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.0713   |long=6.1040    |label=<small>[[FC Metz|Metz]]</small> |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.727606 |long=7.415614  |label=<small>[[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]]</small> |position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.61194  |long=3.97722   |label=<small>[[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=47.255631 |long=-1.525375 |label=<small>[[FC Nantes|Nantes]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.723328 |long=7.458756  |label=<small>[[OGC Nice|Nice]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.8367   |long=4.3601    |label=<small>[[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]]</small> |position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.841422 |long=2.393053  |label=<small>[[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris SG]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.1147   |long=-1.6794   |label=<small>[[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=45.460767 |long=4.490117  |label=<small>[[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|St-\u00c9tienne]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.2583 |long=4.0317 |label=<small>[[Stade de Reims|Reims]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.58 |long=7.75 |label=<small>[[Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=43.583314 |long=1.434047  |label=<small>[[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Club<br />\n!Position<br />in 2018\u201319\n!First season in<br />top division\n!

Over 9,000 proposals were sent in and, on 20 May 2007, [[French Football Federation]] member Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Thiriez announced that, following an online vote, the term ''Hexagoal'' had received half of the votes.

''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' illustrates its entry on ''comic strip'' with a ''Nancy'' cartoon.

Nancy only appears to be simple at a casual glance. Like architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], the simplicity is a carefully designed function of a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by the designer. To look at Bushmiller as an architect is entirely appropriate, for Nancy is, in a sense, a blueprint for a comic strip. Walls, floors, rocks, trees, ice-cream cones, motion lines, midgets and principals are carefully positioned with no need for further embellishment. And they are laid out with one purpose in mind\u2014to get the gag across. Minimalist? Formalist? Structuralist?

''Nancy'' is Plato's playground. Ernie Bushmiller didn't draw A tree, A house, A car. Oh, no. Ernie Bushmiller drew ''the'' tree, ''the'' house, ''the'' car. Much has been made of the \"three rocks.\" Art Spiegelman explains how a drawing of three rocks in a background scene was Ernie's way of showing us there were some rocks in the background. It was always three. Why? Because two rocks wouldn't be \"some rocks.\" Two rocks would be a pair of rocks. And four rocks was unacceptable because four rocks would indicate \"some rocks\" but it would be one rock more than was necessary to convey the idea of \"some rocks.\" A ''Nancy'' panel is an irreduceable concept, an atom, and the comic strip is a molecule.<ref>McCloud, Scott.

Currently, we're using Ernie Bushmiller's art exclusively, but we're not limited to his work... Once I find a strip with a promising panel, I clean up the art as much as I can in Photoshop. I remove the extra panels, and then begin coloring the art. When the panel is colored, I run a filter on the art to create the halftone dots that make the panel look as if it was printed on an old-fashioned four-color press. Finally, I flatten the image and add the indicia, including the original publication date of the strip. Repeat the process until... well, I run out of material.

During that period, [[David Letterman]] showed on TV a ''Nancy'' panel with Plastino's signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman's writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.)\n\nThe strip has continued to the present day by different writers and artists. [[Mark Lasky]] briefly handled the daily strip in 1982/1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. The strip was handed to [[Jerry Scott]] in 1983, who gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations.

At the time of the announcement, 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, \"Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I'm excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine\" and \"the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world\". Comics historian [[Tom Spurgeon]] describes Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller's version.<ref name=Post1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/04/08/for-the-first-time-in-her-85-years-nancy-will-be-drawn-by-a-woman/?noredirect=on|title=For the first time in her 85 years, 'Nancy' will be drawn by a woman|last=Cavna|first=Michael|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 8, 2018|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Post2>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/09/20/the-private-cartoonist-behind-nancy-will-make-her-public-debut-at-the-cxc-festival/ |title=The private cartoonist behind 'Nancy' will make her public debut at the CXC festival |author=Michael Cavna |date=September 20, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"vulture\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/nancy-comic-artist-olivia-jaimes-gives-extended-interview.html |title=Olivia Jaimes, the Mysterious Cartoonist Behind ''Nancy'', Gives Rare Interview |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture.com]] |date=November 26, 2018 |access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the process, Jaimes updated the strip's technology, including Nancy frequently using her [[smartphone]] and attending [[robotics]] classes. The September 3, 2018 strip spawned an [[Internet meme]], depicting Nancy riding a [[Self-balancing scooter|hoverboard]]. using two phones, one of which was attached to a [[selfie stick]], and proclaiming that \"Sluggo is [[wikt:lit|lit]]\". Jaimes described her aim with that strip to \"most upset the person who likes me the least&nbsp;... somebody who's like, 'Nancy sucks now'&nbsp;... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don't understand.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /><ref name=Post2 />\n\n== Art style ==\nBushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' illustrates its entry on ''comic strip'' with a ''Nancy'' cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that ''Nancy'' was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn a 1988 essay, \"[[How to Read Nancy]]\", [[Mark Newgarden]] and [[Paul Karasik]] offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller's strip:\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |To say that ''Nancy'' is a simple gag strip about a simple-minded slot-nosed kid is to miss the point completely. Nancy only appears to be simple at a casual glance. Like architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], the simplicity is a carefully designed function of a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by the designer. To look at Bushmiller as an architect is entirely appropriate, for Nancy is, in a sense, a blueprint for a comic strip. Walls, floors, rocks, trees, ice-cream cones, motion lines, midgets and principals are carefully positioned with no need for further embellishment. And they are laid out with one purpose in mind\u2014to get the gag across. Minimalist? Formalist? Structuralist?

''Nancy'' is Plato's playground. Ernie Bushmiller didn't draw A tree, A house, A car. Oh, no. Ernie Bushmiller drew ''the'' tree, ''the'' house, ''the'' car. Much has been made of the \"three rocks.\" Art Spiegelman explains how a drawing of three rocks in a background scene was Ernie's way of showing us there were some rocks in the background. It was always three. Why? Because two rocks wouldn't be \"some rocks.\" Two rocks would be a pair of rocks. And four rocks was unacceptable because four rocks would indicate \"some rocks\" but it would be one rock more than was necessary to convey the idea of \"some rocks.\" A ''Nancy'' panel is an irreduceable concept, an atom, and the comic strip is a molecule.<ref>McCloud, Scott.

The lack of context-indeed, it's very removal-is what attracted me to Random Acts the moment Guy explained it to me... The process begins by skimming through Nancy daily strips. Currently, we're using Ernie Bushmiller's art exclusively, but we're not limited to his work... Once I find a strip with a promising panel, I clean up the art as much as I can in Photoshop. I remove the extra panels, and then begin coloring the art. When the panel is colored, I run a filter on the art to create the halftone dots that make the panel look as if it was printed on an old-fashioned four-color press. Finally, I flatten the image and add the indicia, including the original publication date of the strip. Repeat the process until... well, I run out of material. Thanks to the genius of Ernie Bushmiller, that's not going to happen any time soon.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Lotshaw |first1=John |title=Random Acts of Nancy |url=https://www.gocomics.com/blog/3005/john-lotshaw-random-acts-of-nancy |website=GoComics blog |access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Guy Gilchrist's departure from ''Nancy'', this strip was discontinued.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Dave Strickler|Strickler, Dave]].
