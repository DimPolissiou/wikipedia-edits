Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]].

Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nWilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga]] - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref>In the ensuing combat and defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign.\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nWilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga]] - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref>In the ensuing combat and defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign.\n\n==Chickamauga==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Prominently featuring 60 of Ferriss' drawings, the book is divided into three sections. The first, \"Cities of Today\", underscores the lack of planning in contemporary cities and the powerful psychological impact that cities have on their inhabitants while also profiling 18 influential modern buildings in five cities. The second section, \"Projected Trends\", prominently discusses practical concerns related to [[population density]] and [[traffic congestion]], demonstrates Ferriss' adherence to some of the key elements of [[modern architecture]] (especially [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]), and then analyzes projected trends in urban design that he supports, as well as a few that he opposes. The third and final section, \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", describes an ideal future city complete with towering skyscrapers spaced well apart from each other, broad avenues, and a strongly geometric city layout based around centers and sub-centers of buildings that are segregated by function.\n\nFirst published by [[Ives Washburn]] in 1929, ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' was out of print long before the [[Princeton Architectural Press]] republished it in 1986. Contemporary critical reception to the book was mostly positive and enthusiastic, and generally regarded Ferriss' ideas for the future city as credible and even practical. While in the minority, negative contemporary reviews of the book significantly came mostly from proponents of the [[regional planning]] movement. Writing with the benefit of hindsight in 1986, architectural historian [[Carol Willis (architectural historian)|Carol Willis]] noted the strong connections between the first and second sections of the book (\"Cities of Today\" and \"Projected Trends\"), but criticized the final section (\"An Imaginary Metropolis\") as a flight of fantasy, both impracticable and lacking in nuance. Similarly, more recent reviewers have concentrated on \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", which they generally view as a fantasy which has had a strong influence on later architects and urban planners, and has also been influential to the appearance of futuristic cities in [[comic book]]s and [[film]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== \"Cities of Today\" ===\n[[File:Print, Proposed Convocation Tower, Madison Square (Northeast Corner of Madison Avenue and East 26th Streeet), 1921 (CH 18452119).jpg|150px|thumb|Hugh Ferriss' drawing of the unbuilt [[Convocation Tower]]]]\n\n''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' is divided into three sections which in total prominently feature 60 of [[Hugh Ferriss]]' drawings.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The first section, \"Cities of Today\", begins with a vignette describing the contemporary [[New York City]] skyline of the late 1920s in theatrical terms, largely focusing on the enormous scale of modern skyscrapers and the impressions they make on city dwellers.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=15\u201317}} According to architectural historian [[Carol Willis (architectural historian)|Carol Willis]], this section outlines the book's main themes, namely the lack of planning in contemporary cities, the powerful psychological impact that cities have on their inhabitants, and the responsibility of architects to preserve humanistic values as cities continue to grow.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} \"Cities of Today\" is mostly devoted to a brief building-by-building analysis of what Ferriss viewed as \"some of the outstanding buildings of the country\", which he considered especially influential and illustrative of future trends.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=18}} In total, 18 projects by 15 different architectural firms in five cities are examined.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The first two buildings profiled are both in [[St. Louis]]: the [[Southwestern Bell Building|Telephone Building]], noted for its use of [[setback (architecture)|setbacks]];{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=20}} and the [[St. Louis Plaza]], which Ferriss upheld as an example of collaborative architectural planning that did not compromise design.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=22}} The next two buildings featured are in [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]]{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=24}} and the [[Tribune Tower|Chicago Tribune Building]], the latter of which Ferriss considered unusually beautiful for an office building.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=26}}\n\nFollowing the St. Louis and Chicago projects, the next set of buildings profiled are all in New York City, and Ferriss featured many of them because of their innovative and sometimes controversial design and styling. These buildings include the [[American Radiator Building|Radiator Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=28}} the [[New York Marriott East Side|Shelton Hotel]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=30}} the unbuilt [[Belden

lobby of the [[Daily News Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=38}} and the unbuilt [[Convocation Tower]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=40}} Following them are three buildings in [[Detroit]] that Ferriss described as \"undoubtedly the forerunners of the future city\":{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=42}} the [[Penobscot Building|Greater Penobscot Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=42}} the [[Fisher Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=44}} and the [[David Stott Building]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=46}} Following this is a single building in [[Los Angeles]], the [[Los Angeles City Hall|Los Angeles Municipal Tower]], which Ferriss noted was the only true skyscraper in the city at the time due to municipal building height limitations.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=48}}\n\nFerriss concluded the \"Cities of Today\" section by returning to New York City and profiling three recent buildings that were built to unprecedented heights and which were, in Ferriss' opinion, the projects that most foreshadowed future developments in skyscrapers and urban construction more generally.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=50}} To Willis, these were the buildings that \"raised the issues of the race for height and of congestion.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The three buildings are the [[Chanin Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=50}} the [[Chrysler Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=52}} and the [[40 Wall Street|Bank of the Manhattan Company Building]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=54}}\n\n=== \"Projected Trends\" ===\n[[File:Drawing, Study for Maximum Mass Permitted by the 1916 New York Zoning Law, Stage 4, 1922 (CH

begins with a brief vignette about the \"lure of the city\" to young people and prominently discusses practical concerns related to [[population density]] and [[traffic congestion]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=59}} Almost all of the drawings in this section were published or exhibited prior to being included in ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow''.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}} In \"Projected Trends\", Ferriss reveals some of his ideas about the power of architecture to influence human thought and behavior, and he proceeds to espouse some of the key elements of [[modern architecture]], especially [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=60\u201361}} He also voices his objection to densely crowding numerous skyscrapers in close proximity to each other, as well as his opposition to building roads and bridges for automobiles above street level in city centers, both of which were somewhat popular ideas among [[futurist]]s at the time.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=62\u201364}} According to Willis, these drawings depicting densely packed skyscrapers and elevated automobile traffic have ironically \"often been misread as endorsements, whereas Ferriss conceived them as admonitions.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}}\n\nFrom here, Ferriss turns his attention to projected trends that he supports: segregating pedestrians from cars by building a system of arcaded walks along buildings, with bridges across intersections one story over street level;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=66}} building skyscraper churches with either apartments or offices accommodating most of the floors, with the [[sanctuary]] either at the base or the top of the building;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=68}} and [[suspension bridge]]s with apartments built into the side of the [[deck (bridge)|bridge deck]] as well as the bridge towers.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=70}} Willis stresses the serious nature of these proposals, observing that \"in the endless invention and boundless expansion of the 1920s, virtually no scheme seemed impossible.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}} Ferriss proceeds to describe and diagram the evolution of the setback principle for skyscraper design, in which he likens the architect's work to a [[sculpture|sculptor]] working with [[clay]], and argues that [[1916 Zoning Resolution|New York City's zoning laws]] are actually a blessing in disguise to architects as they all but mandated the adoption of the setback principle.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=72\u201384}}\n\nFerriss continues with a more practical discussion of the advantages of building skyscrapers on wide avenues and spreading them out from other tall buildings,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=86}} as well as the possibility of constructing buildings spanning two blocks or more with streets passing beneath them in scenic tunnels.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=88\u201390}} He then briefly criticizes architects who wish to revert to \"past styles\" with base-shaft-crown construction instead of adhering to his setback principle{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=92}} before then predicting the increasing popularity of [[penthouse apartment]]s,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=94}} [[roof garden|rooftop gardens]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=96}} and the development of \"modern [[ziggurat]]s\" hosting restaurants and theaters, which he viewed as a natural outgrowth of New York City's zoning laws and setback design.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=98}} Ferriss then concludes the section by noting and extolling the virtues of the three most important building materials for future buildings: [[steel]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=104}} [[concrete]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=102}} and (especially) [[architectural glass|glass]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=100}}\n\n=== \"An Imaginary Metropolis\" ===\nThe third section, \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", begins with a theatrical vignette similar to that of the opening section, but this time the curtain rises on \"a city of the imagination\".{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=109}} It features tall buildings, many of them {{Convert|1,000|ft|m}} in height or taller. Instead of being densely packed, however, they are spread apart from each other and are segregated by function. The tall buildings take up three to eight city blocks for their bases, and they are separated from each other by {{Convert|0.5|mi|km}} of low-rise buildings no taller than six stories in height and connected by broad avenues.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=109\u2013111}} Ferriss visualizes this ideal city as having three main zones: a Business Center, the largest of the three centers, and also home to municipal government buildings;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=112}} an Art Center;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=114}} and a Science Center, which features [[laboratory|laboratories]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=116}} He then outlines the sub-centers of the city, also conceptualized functionally: a Finance Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=128}} a Technology Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=130}} an Industrial Arts Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=132}} and a Philosophy Center.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=136}} These sub-centers are located logically in relation to the centers, so for instance, the Philosophy Center is located between the Art Center and the Science Center.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=171}}\n\nFerriss also sketches plans for a [[fossil fuel power station|coal-fired power plant]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=126}} as well as a single skyscraper church shared by all of the city's religious denominations.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=134}} He visualizes the transportation infrastructure of the city as consisting of underground [[rapid transit|subways]] and [[underground parking|car parking]], with ground-level streets for cars.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=130}} Ferriss concludes the section by providing a bird's eye view of this ideal city, which is centered around a triangular Civic Circle with each of the three main zones (Business Center, Art Center, and Science Center) at its corners, with radial avenues fanning out from them to the sub-centers and ultimately on to the outlying districts of the city.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=138\u2013140}} Willis compares this conception to a [[Renaissance]] treatise, noting its \"strong geometric plan which was primarily formal and symbolic, rather than functional\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=171}} Ferriss concludes the book with a brief epilogue that focuses on his belief about how much architecture influences people.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=142}}\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:HughFerrissAtWork1925.jpg|thumb|Ferriss at work in 1925]]\n\nFerriss received an advance [[royalty payment|royalty]] of $1,000 from the book's publisher, [[Ives Washburn]], in 1929.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} The book was published in late 1929, after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street crash]].{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} Of the 60 illustrations featured in the book, only 13 of them were created specifically for ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'', and all of these 13 appear in the final section \"An Imaginary Metropolis\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}}\n\nWriting in 1986, architectural historian Carol Willis noted that the book had been \"long out of print\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=149}} In 1986, [[Princeton Architectural Press]] republished ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' (along with an essay by Willis) as a companion to the exhibition ''Hugh Ferriss: Metropolis'', which was sponsored by the [[Architectural League of New York]] and partially supported by a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. The exhibit opened at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] in New York City and then traveled to the [[Walker Art Center]] in [[Minneapolis]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Centre de Cr\u00e9ation Industrielle at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]], and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]] in [[London]].{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=iv}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nContemporary reception to ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' was mostly positive and enthusiastic, and generally regarded Ferriss' ideas for the future city as credible and even practical.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}} Albert Guerard of ''Herald Tribune Books'' called the book \"wise and generous in vision, cogent in thought, clear and strong in literary style, appealing as a work of art, magically stirring as a prophecy\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tomorrow Seen by Today|last=Guerard|first=Albert|date=January 19, 1930|work=Herald Tribune Books|page=1}}</ref> Joseph G.

Duffus expressed some reservations over the scale and density of Ferriss' vision, but nonetheless assumed the inevitability of further centralization and thus his ordering of the future city: \"Monster cities and buildings are already here.

planning]] movement.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=175}} In this vein, Geddes Smith wrote that the book \"is certainly beautiful and is probably vicious&nbsp;... because to glorify the American skyscraper is to confirm the thoughtlessness in a perilous fallacy.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lovely Monsters|last=Smith|first=Geddes|date=March 15, 1930|work=[[The Survey]]|issue=63|page=727}}</ref> Even more representative of the regional planning movement was the criticism of Regional Plan Association of America member [[Lewis Mumford]],{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=175}} who warned that under Ferriss' proposal \"innumerable human lives will doubtless be sacrificed to Traffic, Commerce, Properly Regulated and Zoned Heights on a scale that will make [[Moloch]] seem an agent of charity.\"<ref>{{Cite

city seems decidedly a fantasy, exaggerated in its scale and hierarchical order, and certainly impracticable.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}} She further writes that with the benefit of \"today's historical distance, the impressive scale and harmonious ensembles of Ferriss' colossal towers and the formal hierarchy of his ideal city seem obviously impracticable and politically naive\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} Furthermore, she observes that Ferriss' \"ideal metropolis radically contradicts most current opinion on the best qualities of a liveable city\", most notably \"an emphasis on pedestrian scale, public spaces, historic preservation and a heterogeneous urban fabric\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} More concretely, Willis notes that while Ferriss detailed some features of the city in great detail, \"many other aspects of urban life were completely ignored\",{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} including schools, hospitals, police stations, post offices, stadiums, movie theaters, factories, and residences.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} She observes that while the first two sections of the book \"linked current conditions and future projects\", the third and final section \"presented not an extrapolation or evolution of the contemporary city, but a utopia created ''[[ex novo]]''\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Justin Davidson introduces his book Magnetic City at Columbia GSAPP (cropped).jpg|125px|thumb|[[Justin Davidson]]]]\n\nIn 2016, while writing for ''[[CityLab]]'', [[Carl Abbott (urban historian)|Carl Abbott]] described the \"unrestrained imagination\"

illustrated by [[Hugh Ferriss]]. Prominently featuring 60 of Ferriss' drawings, the book is divided into three sections. The first, \"Cities of Today\", underscores the lack of planning in contemporary cities and the powerful psychological impact that cities have on their inhabitants while also profiling 18 influential modern buildings in five cities. The second section, \"Projected Trends\", prominently discusses practical concerns related to [[population density]] and [[traffic congestion]], demonstrates Ferriss' adherence to some of the key elements of [[modern architecture]] (especially [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]), and then analyzes projected trends in urban design that he supports, as well as a few that he opposes. The third and final section, \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", describes an ideal future city complete with towering skyscrapers spaced well apart from each other, broad avenues, and a strongly geometric city layout based around centers and sub-centers of buildings that are segregated by function.\n\nFirst published by [[Ives Washburn]] in 1929, ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' was out of print long before the [[Princeton Architectural Press]] republished it in 1986. Contemporary critical reception to the book was mostly positive and enthusiastic, and generally regarded Ferriss' ideas for the future city as credible and even practical. While in the minority, negative contemporary reviews of the book significantly came mostly from proponents of the [[regional planning]] movement. Writing with the benefit of hindsight in 1986, architectural historian [[Carol Willis (architectural historian)|Carol Willis]] noted the strong connections between the first and second sections of the book (\"Cities of Today\" and \"Projected Trends\"), but criticized the final section (\"An Imaginary Metropolis\") as a flight of fantasy, both impracticable and lacking in nuance. Similarly, more recent reviewers have concentrated on \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", which they generally view as a fantasy which has had a strong influence on later architects and urban planners, and has also been influential to the appearance of futuristic cities in [[comic book]]s and [[film]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== \"Cities of Today\" ===\n[[File:Print, Proposed Convocation Tower, Madison Square (Northeast Corner of Madison Avenue and East 26th Streeet), 1921 (CH 18452119).jpg|150px|thumb|Hugh Ferriss' drawing of the unbuilt [[Convocation Tower]]]]\n\n''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' is divided into three sections which in total prominently feature 60 of [[Hugh Ferriss]]' drawings.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The first section, \"Cities of Today\", begins with a vignette describing the contemporary [[New York City]] skyline of the late 1920s in theatrical terms, largely focusing on the enormous scale of modern skyscrapers and the impressions they make on city dwellers.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=15\u201317}} According to architectural historian [[Carol Willis (architectural historian)|Carol Willis]], this section outlines the book's main themes, namely the lack of planning in contemporary cities, the powerful psychological impact that cities have on their inhabitants, and the responsibility of architects to preserve humanistic values as cities continue to grow.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} \"Cities of Today\" is mostly devoted to a brief building-by-building analysis of what Ferriss viewed as \"some of the outstanding buildings of the country\", which he considered especially influential and illustrative of future trends.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=18}} In total, 18 projects by 15 different architectural firms in five cities are examined.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The first two buildings profiled are both in [[St. Louis]]: the [[Southwestern Bell Building|Telephone Building]], noted for its use of [[setback (architecture)|setbacks]];{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=20}} and the [[St. Louis Plaza]], which Ferriss upheld as an example of collaborative architectural planning that did not compromise design.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=22}} The next two buildings featured are in [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]]{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=24}} and the [[Tribune Tower|Chicago Tribune Building]], the latter of which Ferriss considered unusually beautiful for an office building.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=26}}\n\nFollowing the St. Louis and Chicago projects, the next set of buildings profiled are all in New York City, and Ferriss featured many of them because of their innovative and sometimes controversial design and styling. These buildings include the [[American Radiator Building|Radiator Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=28}} the [[New York Marriott East Side|Shelton Hotel]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=30}} the unbuilt [[Belden Project]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=32}} the [[Master Apartments|Master Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=34}} the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Office Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=36}} the lobby of the [[Daily News Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=38}} and the unbuilt [[Convocation Tower]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=40}} Following them are three buildings in [[Detroit]] that Ferriss described as \"undoubtedly the forerunners of the future city\":{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=42}} the [[Penobscot Building|Greater Penobscot Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=42}} the [[Fisher Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=44}} and the [[David Stott Building]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=46}} Following this is a single building in [[Los Angeles]], the [[Los Angeles City Hall|Los Angeles Municipal Tower]], which Ferriss noted was the only true skyscraper in the city at the time due to municipal building height limitations.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=48}}\n\nFerriss concluded the \"Cities of Today\" section by returning to New York City and profiling three recent buildings that were built to unprecedented heights and which were, in Ferriss' opinion, the projects that most foreshadowed future developments in skyscrapers and urban construction more generally.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=50}} To Willis, these were the buildings that \"raised the issues of the race for height and of congestion.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=169}} The three buildings are the [[Chanin Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=50}} the [[Chrysler Building]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=52}} and the [[40 Wall Street|Bank of the Manhattan Company Building]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=54}}\n\n=== \"Projected Trends\" ===\n[[File:Drawing, Study for Maximum Mass Permitted by the 1916 New York Zoning Law, Stage 4, 1922 (CH 18468717).jpg|150px|thumb|Ferriss' drawing on a study for the maximum mass permitted by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution|1916 New York City zoning laws]]]]\n\nThe second section, \"Projected Trends\", begins with a brief vignette about the \"lure of the city\" to young people and prominently discusses practical concerns related to [[population density]] and [[traffic congestion]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=59}} Almost all of the drawings in this section were published or exhibited prior to being included in ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow''.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}} In \"Projected Trends\", Ferriss reveals some of his ideas about the power of architecture to influence human thought and behavior, and he proceeds to espouse some of the key elements of [[modern architecture]], especially [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=60\u201361}} He also voices his objection to densely crowding numerous skyscrapers in close proximity to each other, as well as his opposition to building roads and bridges for automobiles above street level in city centers, both of which were somewhat popular ideas among [[futurist]]s at the time.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=62\u201364}} According to Willis, these drawings depicting densely packed skyscrapers and elevated automobile traffic have ironically \"often been misread as endorsements, whereas Ferriss conceived them as admonitions.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}}\n\nFrom here, Ferriss turns his attention to projected trends that he supports: segregating pedestrians from cars by building a system of arcaded walks along buildings, with bridges across intersections one story over street level;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=66}} building skyscraper churches with either apartments or offices accommodating most of the floors, with the [[sanctuary]] either at the base or the top of the building;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=68}} and [[suspension bridge]]s with apartments built into the side of the [[deck (bridge)|bridge deck]] as well as the bridge towers.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=70}} Willis stresses the serious nature of these proposals, observing that \"in the endless invention and boundless expansion of the 1920s, virtually no scheme seemed impossible.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=170}} Ferriss proceeds to describe and diagram the evolution of the setback principle for skyscraper design, in which he likens the architect's work to a [[sculpture|sculptor]] working with [[clay]], and argues that [[1916 Zoning Resolution|New York City's zoning laws]] are actually a blessing in disguise to architects as they all but mandated the adoption of the setback principle.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=72\u201384}}\n\nFerriss continues with a more practical discussion of the advantages of building skyscrapers on wide avenues and spreading them out from other tall buildings,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=86}} as well as the possibility of constructing buildings spanning two blocks or more with streets passing beneath them in scenic tunnels.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=88\u201390}} He then briefly criticizes architects who wish to revert to \"past styles\" with base-shaft-crown construction instead of adhering to his setback principle{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=92}} before then predicting the increasing popularity of [[penthouse apartment]]s,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=94}} [[roof garden|rooftop gardens]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=96}} and the development of \"modern [[ziggurat]]s\" hosting restaurants and theaters, which he viewed as a natural outgrowth of New York City's zoning laws and setback design.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=98}} Ferriss then concludes the section by noting and extolling the virtues of the three most important building materials for future buildings: [[steel]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=104}} [[concrete]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=102}} and (especially) [[architectural glass|glass]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=100}}\n\n=== \"An Imaginary Metropolis\" ===\nThe third section, \"An Imaginary Metropolis\", begins with a theatrical vignette similar to that of the opening section, but this time the curtain rises on \"a city of the imagination\".{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=109}} It features tall buildings, many of them {{Convert|1,000|ft|m}} in height or taller. Instead of being densely packed, however, they are spread apart from each other and are segregated by function. The tall buildings take up three to eight city blocks for their bases, and they are separated from each other by {{Convert|0.5|mi|km}} of low-rise buildings no taller than six stories in height and connected by broad avenues.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=109\u2013111}} Ferriss visualizes this ideal city as having three main zones: a Business Center, the largest of the three centers, and also home to municipal government buildings;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=112}} an Art Center;{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=114}} and a Science Center, which features [[laboratory|laboratories]].{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=116}} He then outlines the sub-centers of the city, also conceptualized functionally: a Finance Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=128}} a Technology Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=130}} an Industrial Arts Center,{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=132}} and a Philosophy Center.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=136}} These sub-centers are located logically in relation to the centers, so for instance, the Philosophy Center is located between the Art Center and the Science Center.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=171}}\n\nFerriss also sketches plans for a [[fossil fuel power station|coal-fired power plant]],{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=126}} as well as a single skyscraper church shared by all of the city's religious denominations.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=134}} He visualizes the transportation infrastructure of the city as consisting of underground [[rapid transit|subways]] and [[underground parking|car parking]], with ground-level streets for cars.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=130}} Ferriss concludes the section by providing a bird's eye view of this ideal city, which is centered around a triangular Civic Circle with each of the three main zones (Business Center, Art Center, and Science Center) at its corners, with radial avenues fanning out from them to the sub-centers and ultimately on to the outlying districts of the city.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|pp=138\u2013140}} Willis compares this conception to a [[Renaissance]] treatise, noting its \"strong geometric plan which was primarily formal and symbolic, rather than functional\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=171}} Ferriss concludes the book with a brief epilogue that focuses on his belief about how much architecture influences people.{{sfn|Ferriss|1929|p=142}}\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:HughFerrissAtWork1925.jpg|thumb|Ferriss at work in 1925]]\n\nFerriss received an advance [[royalty payment|royalty]] of $1,000 from the book's publisher, [[Ives Washburn]], in 1929.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} The book was published in late 1929, after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street crash]].{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} Of the 60 illustrations featured in the book, only 13 of them were created specifically for ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'', and all of these 13 appear in the final section \"An Imaginary Metropolis\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}}\n\nWriting in 1986, architectural historian Carol Willis noted that the book had been \"long out of print\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=149}} In 1986, [[Princeton Architectural Press]] republished ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' (along with an essay by Willis) as a companion to the exhibition ''Hugh Ferriss: Metropolis'', which was sponsored by the [[Architectural League of New York]] and partially supported by a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. The exhibit opened at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] in New York City and then traveled to the [[Walker Art Center]] in [[Minneapolis]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Centre de Cr\u00e9ation Industrielle at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]], and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]] in [[London]].{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=iv}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nContemporary reception to ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' was mostly positive and enthusiastic, and generally regarded Ferriss' ideas for the future city as credible and even practical.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}} Albert Guerard of ''Herald Tribune Books'' called the book \"wise and generous in vision, cogent in thought, clear and strong in literary style, appealing as a work of art, magically stirring as a prophecy\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tomorrow Seen by Today|last=Guerard|first=Albert|date=January 19, 1930|work=Herald Tribune Books|page=1}}</ref> Joseph G.

L. Duffus expressed some reservations over the scale and density of Ferriss' vision, but nonetheless assumed the inevitability of further centralization and thus his ordering of the future city: \"Monster cities and buildings are already here. They are being built by forces not yet under our control. The task is to subdue them&nbsp;... [and] Mr. Ferriss has contributed something to the fulfillment of that goal.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Metropolis of the Future: Mr. Ferriss Considers the Problem Created by the Skyscraper|last=Duffus|first=R. L.|date=December 8, 1929|work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|page=10}}</ref>\n\nNegative contemporary reviews of ''The Metropolis of Tomorrow'' came mostly from proponents of the [[regional planning]] movement.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=175}} In this vein, Geddes Smith wrote that the book \"is certainly beautiful and is probably vicious&nbsp;... because to glorify the American skyscraper is to confirm the thoughtlessness in a perilous fallacy.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lovely Monsters|last=Smith|first=Geddes|date=March 15, 1930|work=[[The Survey]]|issue=63|page=727}}</ref> Even more representative of the regional planning movement was the criticism of Regional Plan Association of America member [[Lewis Mumford]],{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=175}} who warned that under Ferriss' proposal \"innumerable human lives will doubtless be sacrificed to Traffic, Commerce, Properly Regulated and Zoned Heights on a scale that will make [[Moloch]] seem an agent of charity.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Sacred City|last=Mumford|first=Lewis|date=January 27, 1926|work=[[The New Republic]]|issue=45|page=271|author-link=Lewis Mumford}}</ref> Mumford further objected to skyscrapers as \"pyramids of ground rents\",<ref>{{Cite news|title=Skyscrapers in the City of the Future|last=Mumford|first=Lewis|date=April 23, 1930|work=[[The New Republic]]|issue=62|page=275|author-link=Lewis

the decent and otherwise enlightened technicians of the New York Committee on the Regional Plan have fallen under it.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=The City of Tomorrow|last=Mumford|first=Lewis|date=February 12, 1930|work=[[The New Republic]]|issue=61|page=332|author-link=Lewis Mumford}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1986, Carol Willis notes that Ferriss' \"future city seems decidedly a fantasy, exaggerated in its scale and hierarchical order, and certainly impracticable.\"{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}} She further writes that with the benefit of \"today's historical distance, the impressive scale and harmonious ensembles of Ferriss' colossal towers and the formal hierarchy of his ideal city seem obviously impracticable and politically naive\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} Furthermore, she observes that Ferriss' \"ideal metropolis radically contradicts most current opinion on the best qualities of a liveable city\", most notably \"an emphasis on pedestrian scale, public spaces, historic preservation and a heterogeneous urban fabric\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=148}} More concretely, Willis notes that while Ferriss detailed some features of the city in great detail, \"many other aspects of urban life were completely ignored\",{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} including schools, hospitals, police stations, post offices, stadiums, movie theaters, factories, and residences.{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=173}} She observes that while the first two sections of the book \"linked current conditions and future projects\", the third and final section \"presented not an extrapolation or evolution of the contemporary city, but a utopia created ''[[ex novo]]''\".{{sfn|Willis|1986|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Justin Davidson introduces his book Magnetic City at Columbia GSAPP (cropped).jpg|125px|thumb|[[Justin Davidson]]]]\n\nIn 2016, while writing for ''[[CityLab]]'', [[Carl Abbott (urban historian)|Carl Abbott]] described the \"unrestrained imagination\"

Anarchist [[Stuart Christie]] wrote that ''Now and After'' is \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Building a Library: Anarchy |last=Christie |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Christie |date=July 24, 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] }}</ref> Historian [[Paul Avrich]] described it as \"a classic\" and wrote that it was \"the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language\".<ref name=Avrich>Avrich, p. 206.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe anarchist movement was under siege during the 1920s. The United States had deported hundreds of anarchists, including Berkman and [[Emma Goldman]], in 1919. In the newly created [[Soviet Union]], [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] were being arrested by the [[Cheka]] and imprisoned or executed.<ref>Raleigh, p. 169.</ref> In [[Free Territory|Ukraine]], an [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|anarchist army]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]] had been defeated by the [[Red Army]].<ref>Kenez, p. 45.</ref> Hundreds of Russian anarchists were fleeing to exile in Germany and France.\n\nIn an effort to revive the movement, the [[Jewish Anarchist Federation]] in [[New York City|New York]] asked Berkman in 1926 to write an introduction to anarchism intended for the general public.<ref name=Avrich/> By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public's eyes.\n\n== The book ==\n\nBerkman's work explains anarchist philosophy in terms that uninitiated readers can understand. The book's chapters are brief, and many of them begin with questions (''e.g.'', \"Is Anarchism Violence?\", \"Will Communist Anarchism Work?\"). A number of the ideas he discusses are similar to those proposed in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom Berkman cites throughout. Berkman avoids the sort of jargon and technical language that is often used by political writers in favor of plain language. As he writes in his foreword:\n\n{{quote|Anarchist books, with few exceptions, are not accessible to the understanding of the average reader. It is the common failing of most works dealing with social questions that they are written on the assumption that the reader is already familiar to a considerable extent with the subject, which is generally not the case at all. As a result there are very few books treating of social problems in a sufficiently simple and intelligible manner.\n\nFor the above reason I consider a restatement of the Anarchist position very much needed at this time\u2014a restatement in the plainest and clearest terms which can be understood by every one. That is, an ABC of Anarchism.<ref>Berkman, p. xiii.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1929, ''Now and After'' was published by Vanguard Press in New York. In 1937, a year after Berkman's death, a second edition was published with a preface by Emma Goldman. A British edition was published in 1942 by [[Freedom Press]] in [[London]].

First published in 1929 by Vanguard Press, after parts of it had appeared in the ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', ''Now and After'' has been reprinted many times, often under the title '''''What Is Communist Anarchism?''''' or '''''What Is Anarchism?'''''.<ref name=Pateman>Berkman, p. viii (Introduction by Barry Pateman).</ref> Because of its presentation of anarchist philosophy in plain language, ''Now and After'' has become one of the best-known introductions to anarchism in print. Anarchist [[Stuart Christie]] wrote that ''Now and After'' is \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Building a Library: Anarchy |last=Christie |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Christie |date=July 24, 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] }}</ref> Historian [[Paul Avrich]] described it as \"a classic\" and wrote that it was \"the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language\".<ref name=Avrich>Avrich, p. 206.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe anarchist movement was under siege during the 1920s. The United States had deported hundreds of anarchists, including Berkman and [[Emma Goldman]], in 1919. In the newly created [[Soviet Union]], [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] were being arrested by the [[Cheka]] and imprisoned or executed.<ref>Raleigh, p. 169.</ref> In [[Free Territory|Ukraine]], an [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|anarchist army]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]] had been defeated by the [[Red Army]].<ref>Kenez, p. 45.</ref> Hundreds of Russian anarchists were fleeing to exile in Germany and France.\n\nIn an effort to revive the movement, the [[Jewish Anarchist Federation]] in [[New York City|New York]] asked Berkman in 1926 to write an introduction to anarchism intended for the general public.<ref name=Avrich/> By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public's eyes.\n\n== The book ==\n\nBerkman's work explains anarchist philosophy in terms that uninitiated readers can understand. The book's chapters are brief, and many of them begin with questions (''e.g.'', \"Is Anarchism Violence?\", \"Will Communist Anarchism Work?\"). A number of the ideas he discusses are similar to those proposed in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom Berkman cites throughout. Berkman avoids the sort of jargon and technical language that is often used by political writers in favor of plain language. As he writes in his foreword:\n\n{{quote|Anarchist books, with few exceptions, are not accessible to the understanding of the average reader. It is the common failing of most works dealing with social questions that they are written on the assumption that the reader is already familiar to a considerable extent with the subject, which is generally not the case at all. As a result there are very few books treating of social problems in a sufficiently simple and intelligible manner.\n\nFor the above reason I consider a restatement of the Anarchist position very much needed at this time\u2014a restatement in the plainest and clearest terms which can be understood by every one. That is, an ABC of Anarchism.<ref>Berkman, p. xiii.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1929, ''Now and After'' was published by Vanguard Press in New York. In 1937, a year after Berkman's death, a second edition was published with a preface by Emma Goldman. A British edition was published in 1942 by [[Freedom Press]] in [[London]]. Since then, the book has been reprinted many times.<ref name=Pateman/>\n\n== References ==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]].
