Poor eyesight was an obstacle to his pursuit of a career within the navy but after a spiritual conversion experience he entered the Faculty for Theology in Paris and in 1905 was ordained a pastor of the Reformed Church of France. After having been a Protestant [[pastor]] in a rural parish in Aouste-sur-Sye in [[Dr\u00f4me]], in 1911 he became professor of theology at the House of the Missions of Paris, and in 1918 went on to the Parish of Poissy-Annonciation where he remained until 1952. In 1928, he inaugurated the sermons of Protestant Lent on the radio, which contributed to his notoriety. There he preached on the [[oikoumene|unity of Christians]]. In 1929, he became the first president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration protestante de France''), a position he held until 1961. In 1938 he became the first president of the national council of the [[Reformed Church of France]] (''l'\u00c9glise r\u00e9form\u00e9e de France''), a post he held until 1950. He was on two occasions the professor at the Academy of International Law at The Hague. Between 1938 and 1948 he was president of the administrative committee of the provisional [[World Council of Churches]] in formation. After the council had been formed he became one of its co-presidents, a post he held until 1954.\n\nBoegner actively worked, during the occupation, in an open way as well as clandestinely, to try to improve the lot of the Jews, and even defended and saved a number of them. His compassion extended also to many political refugees. He intervened with Pierre Laval, in vain, to ask him to give up including Jewish children younger than 16 years in the deportation convoys. In 1943, he condemned the forced sending of workers to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under the [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]]. Against violence and the armed struggle, he let his faith and conscience choose against joining the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] in an early stage. His action to help the Jews during the war made him be awarded the [[Righteous among the Nations]] in [[Yad Vashem]] in 1988.\n\nHaving met six times, in the middle of his resistance work, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], he was decorated with the [[Order of the Francisque]] and was named a member of the National Council of [[Vichy France|Vichy]]. He remained, at the time of his questioning in the Allied lawsuit against the old leader, on 30 July 1945, to testify for the good intentions and the goodwill expressed by P\u00e9tain in the difficult circumstances of France - a lenient idea of P\u00e9tain's actions, today contradicted by authors and some historians.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his fight for unity while taking part in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] (''mouvement \u0153cum\u00e9nique''). He was also a Protestant observer during the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) during which he staged a public dialogue with [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Bea]] in Geneva.

{"title_page": "Historical European Martial Arts in Australia", "text_new": "{{short description|Martial Arts in Australia}}\nThe practice of '''[[Historical European Martial Arts]]''' (HEMA) first started '''in Australia''' in the late 19th century before largely dying out. There was then a revival of interest in the late 20th century to the current day. The practice of HEMA in Australia has grown to be a popular activity, with clubs all in capital cities, and the larger cities in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, each have a number of clubs teaching various styles.\n\n==History==\n\n===European Martial Arts around turn of the century Australia===\nUnusually, Australia was the scene for relatively well attended broadsword competitions,  in the late 19th century.  Some of the first practice of HEMA in Australia occurred when an English champion of the broadsword, Captain Duncan Ross, fought another British military instructor, Captain Jennings in San Francisco. Though Ross won the tournament, Jennings left the United States, to travel to Australia. Jennings then fought a mounted sword competition with a local challenger, \"Sergeant J. R. Donovan., late Drill Instructor to 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, Champion Swordsman of Australia.\".<ref name=WBH>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbroadswordchampionship.com/index.php/history |title=History |website=Worldbroadswordchampionship.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\nHearing of this, Ross took the first boat to Australia, and challenged Jennings to a tournament, to confirm his title.   The initial tournament, in  December 1889, saw Ross break his sword and the tournament was postponed. The follow up  tournament was attended by 5600 people.  The final tournament was attended by 25,000 people, with Jennings defeating Ross, an early large interest in Australian Hema (from a spectators point of view, at least0.  However, Jennings himself was then defeated by an Australian, Sergeant J. R. Donovan. Donovan eventually lost the title to a Professor Parker, who was the last person to hold the title, remaining unchallenged till his death in Sydney, in April, 1916.<ref name=WBH/>\n\nSome HEMA in Australia had been practiced, in the later part of the early 20th century, mainly in the context of the Australian Military. The Australian defence forces practiced sword drills, and some competitions and mounted sword combat. Additionally, the military sometimes would run \"Assault at Arms exhibitions\". HEMA in Australia was featured by soldiers performing feats of arms, often for charity, including in at least one case, [[Bartitsu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartitsu.org/index.php/tag/australia/ |title=Australia |website=Bartitsu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century revival===\nProbably the earliest [[Historical European martial arts|HEMA]] activity in Australia was that of Stephen Hand, Andrew Brew and Peter Radvan who started researching rapier and sword from period [[:wikt:manual|manuals]] in the mid 80s and teaching in around 1990. At this time, most European style combat in Australia was in the context of [[Historical reenactment in Australia]]. With few primary sources available, it was largely improvised with little relationship to authentic historical practice.<ref name=\"stoccata1\">{{cite web|url=http://stoccata.org/index.php/about-us/our-history |title=Our History |website=Stoccata.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>Martain, Tim \u201cCutting edge skills on offer at sharp end\u201d  Hobart Mercury 26 January 2005 p 16</ref> All three men were involved in Re-enactment groups but wanted to move more into the actual study of period combat techniques.\n\nStephen Hand originally from [[Hobart]], moved to Sydney, where Brew and Radvan lived in 1989, and together they taught themselves and researched historical fencing from the few resources they had available. When they discovered the American scholar Patri Pugliese who collected, copied and sold historical fencing manuals, they gained access to more material but continued teaching as part of several historical reenactment groups. They started the Stoccata School of Defence, Gordon, Sydney in August 1998,  which was one of the first groups in Australia to approach [[Historical European martial arts|HEMA]] as a traditional art of defence in itself, rather than in the context of [[Historical reenactment|re-enacting]] a period or era. One of the early stars of Stoccata was Paul Wagner who rapidly rose to become a fourth instructor. Stephen and Paul have gone on to teach HEMA all over the world and to write a number of highly regarded books on various HEMA systems.\n\nAt around the same time Julian Clark, a modern fencing instructor was exploring historical fencing in Canberra and founded the Finesse Academy of Fencing.\n\nA few other clubs started to form around this time, with Scott McDonald forming the Australian College of Arms (ACA) in Brisbane and then restarting it in Melbourne when he moved there.<ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\" /> In 1995 a group of mostly Italian and German competitive fencers from Penrith Fencing Academy and Double Eagle at the German Austrian Club (Winter, Sanders, Ketibian, et al.) introduced training and formal competition in rapier and broadsword forming an unnamed group that endured until 2005 when it merged with the Sydney chapter of the Masonic Academy of Arms. Their use of historical weapons was done with modern electric fencing gear and led to some technical advances in modernizing medieval weapons to be electric by a swordsmith and historian in their academy leading to the first electric period weapons, including spears and axes.\n\nIn September 199 Scott McDonald organised one of the first open group events for historical fencing in Australia, named the first Historical Fencing Meeting (later to be called Historical Fencing Conferences) in Brisbane. At around the same time in Brisbane fencers who were part of the Historical Armed Combat Association (HACA) broke away to form their own fencing organisations. Notable among these was Bill Carew, who formed Collegium in Armis, which continues to operate to this day.\n\nHistorical Fencing Conferences were held yearly from 1999. International guests were invited to teach at these conferences, including Bob Charron, Ramon and Jeannette Martinez, Tom Leoni, and Milo Thurston. In 2000, the idea of an association for historical fencing  groups was raised. This became the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation, and formally started in 2002, with Stephen Hand as the first President.<ref name=\"stoccata1\" />\n\nIn Melbourne, after Scott McDonald moved to [[Brisbane]], the Melbourne Swordplay Guild was formed from those old members of the Australian College of Arms that wanted to continue. Initially the group used the Stoccata [[syllabus]] of [[George Silver]]. Members of the Melbourne Swordplay Guild went on to form three clubs in Melbourne, Die Fechtschule in 2005, GLECA (Glen Lachlann Estate College of Arms) and more recently, Fechtschule Victoria in 2013.<ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourneswordplay.com/about-us/ |title=About Us - Melbourne Swordplay Guild |publisher=Melbourneswordplay.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fechtschulevictoria.org.au/ |title=German longsword school, Melbourne Australia |publisher=Fechtschule Victoria |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>\"Swordplay's exciting Dance passion\" St Marys Star 15 January 2013 p 13</ref>\n\nBy 2004, Stoccata in Sydney had grown and had spawned a Tasmanian group, to become Australia's first interstate club.<ref>Hopkins, Clive ACTIVE The Sydney Morning Herald 18 June 2005 p 32,</ref> Stoccata now have ten branches Australia wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoccata.org/|title=Stoccata School of Defence Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOver the years seminars have benefited from visiting overseas experts in HEMA, including visits to Sydney and Melbourne by [[Arne Koets]], Guy Windsor (an expert in Italian Swordsmanship) Puck Curtis and most recently, Ingulf Kohlweiss, chief trainer of INDES Salzburg (Austria)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdtoknight.wordpress.com/2016/05/18/geekfest-festival-of-the-sword-episode-1-a-new-geekery/ |title=Geekfest (Festival of the Sword, Episode 1: A New Geekery) &#124; Nerd to Knight |website=Nerdtoknight.wordpress.com |date=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref> and Peter Smallridge from the UK.\n\nSome Rapier has developed within the Australian branch of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], the [[Kingdom of Lochac]], with some SCA members learning [[SCA fencing]] (which has become more based on period practice over time) and some SCA fencers in Melbourne starting separate schools of Historical swordsmanship distinct from the SCA.\n\nBy 2017, the interest in HEMA had grown to the point where there were clubs in most large cities in Australia <ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\"/><ref>\u201cEn Garde For Safe Sword Play\u201d Coffs Coast Advocate 11 July 2015 p43</ref>\n\nSome equipment, mainly for HEMA Longsword is designed in Australia, with synthetic [[Sword|swords]] and protective [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]] made by WMA shop in Sydney, and [[Gambeson]]s for Longsword designed in Melbourne by AESIR.\n\n==National bodies and associations==\nThe Australian Historical Swordplay Federation  formed in 2002, and was the first group in Australia with the aim of being an umbrella group for groups practicing HEMA. The Federation was initially formed with 5 groups, Stoccata, ACA, Finesse, Gemeiner Academy and Prima Spada. This association ran for a number of years, conducted research and ran annual conferences. The Federation also hosted an annual conference and fought the anti-sword legislation in the Australian states of Victoria and NSW, helping to stop the banning of Swords in the latter state. Stephen Hand was the inaugural President, with the Presidency eventually going to Scott Nimmo in Melbourne.  However support and interest in the Federation petered out, and the Federation was wound up in 2014.\n\nWith the  activity of the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation winding down, another group was formed  by Scott Nimmo in Melbourne. Like the Federation, this group's aim was to act as an umbrella group for HEMA clubs active in Australia. This was the Western Martial Academies of Australia (WMAA). The WMAA has 10 groups as either members or affiliates, and liaises with groups over issues including syllabi, members and safety, and has organised over 50 tournaments.\n\nIn 2018 the Historical Fencing Association (HFA) another umbrella organisation, was formed by Jerry Gullotti along with fencers from Queensland, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Sydney. This group was formed to focus more heavily on the sporting aspects of HEMA, to provide a unified insurance system for member clubs, and assist clubs with standards for safety, rules, and starting new clubs. At the close of 2019 HFA had 17 member/affiliate groups.\n\n==Styles of combat==\nWithin HEMA in Australia, there is a wide variety of weapons and martial styles practiced. The 20 or so clubs in Australia have a wide area of focus and practice, using  various particular weapons and practicing various styles.  Some focus on one weapon and the use of it, while others will focus on a number of weapons in the same period, and others will focus on different periods. Early clubs in Australia focused primarily on [[rapier]], [[sidesword]] <nowiki/>and backsword, largely because of the interest of the practitioners, and the limited availability of English language or translated manuals at the time. Later clubs focused on Longsword, with some clubs focusing on the [[German school of fencing]] while others focused on the [[Italian school of swordsmanship]]. In recent times, there has also been a focus on Victorian era martial arts within HEMA in Australia, including [[Savate]], [[Canne de combat]], [[Sabre]],  [[Bartitsu]] and [[Boxing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/bartitsu-emerges-from-shadows-as-an-elementary-form-of-defence/story-fnay3ubk-1226654768379 |title=Bartitsu Emerges From shadows as an Elementary Form of Defence |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\n==Tournaments and conferences==\nThe annual Australian Historical Swordplay Convention, primarily a teaching event, was hosted and attended by diverse Australian groups from 1999 to 2006. It was held initially in Brisbane in 1999 and then 2006, Sydney in 2000 and 2004, Canberra in 2001 and 2005, the  Gold Coast in 2003 and Melbourne in 2002.\n\nIn 2009 Scott McDonald started what was to become one of the largest and longest running Historical European Martial Arts events, Swordplay. Swordplay initially started with all the groups in Brisbane competing, under a group of rules devised to be acceptable as much as possible, for all participants. The event is the longest running tournament of its kind in Australia, still running in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swordplayevent.id.au/?page_id=31 |title=Swordplay Event History &#124; Swordplay 2015 |website=Swordplayevent.id.au |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref> At times Swordplay has been referred to as the National tournament for HEMA, but the organisers themselves and many participants acknowledge there are now in fact a number of tournaments, and there currently is no official recognised \u201cnational\u201d event.\n\nIn May 2015, Sword Fight Gold Coast was run. Building of the Swordplay and Nordic models, Sword Fight was developed to provide a professional indoor event for Queensland historical fencers. Additionally, Sword Fight provided access to novice divisions using synthetic weapons in order to provide an inclusive environment for rookie fencers. In 2016 this event became the first tournament in Australia to include a women's division. <ref>Sword Fight Gold Coast - Sword Fighter http://www.swordfighter.com.au/sword-fight/</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Australia's Stoccata School of Defence hosted a revival of the World Broadsword Championship in Sydney, Australia. This event, held  throughout the late 19th century in England, the United States and Australia was last won by Professor Parker in Sydney in 1891. Parker was never challenged. The 2015 event was won by Paul Wagner of Sydney, also the current holder of the Glorianna Cup, the broadsword championship of Britain. Lewis Hand of Hobart, Australia won the junior title. In the tradition of the 19th century title, the championship is held in the home town of the current Champion. As such the championship was held again in Sydney in September 2017 with Paul Wagner once again claiming victory. In June 2018 the championship was held at the Australian Western Martial Arts Convention (AWMAC) in Sydney.

The tournaments are held in the various states of Australia, and are divided into two tiers. With this, a leaderboard has been established to indicate where participating HEMA practitioners are placed.  It fulfills a few roles for HEMA Australia practitioners by encouraging participation in tournaments and their associated conferences, supporting participating conferences/tournaments by highlighting their existence, encouraging people to travel to different tournaments, and also to build the HEMA community in Australia. \nState representatives are nominated, and then voted on to the committee by those in the hema community from their respective state, on a yearly basis.

There was then a revival of interest in the late 20th century to the current day. The practice of HEMA in Australia has grown to be a popular activity, with clubs all in capital cities, and the larger cities in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, each have a number of clubs teaching various styles.\n\n==History==\n\n===European Martial Arts around turn of the century Australia===\nUnusually, Australia was the scene for relatively well attended broadsword competitions,  in the late 19th century.  Some of the first practice of HEMA in Australia occurred when an English champion of the broadsword, Captain Duncan Ross, fought another British military instructor, Captain Jennings in San Francisco. Though Ross won the tournament, Jennings left the United States, to travel to Australia. Jennings then fought a mounted sword competition with a local challenger, \"Sergeant J. R. Donovan., late Drill Instructor to 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, Champion Swordsman of Australia.\".<ref name=WBH>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbroadswordchampionship.com/index.php/history |title=History |website=Worldbroadswordchampionship.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\nHearing of this, Ross took the first boat to Australia, and challenged Jennings to a tournament, to confirm his title.   The initial tournament, in  December 1889, saw Ross break his sword and the tournament was postponed. The follow up  tournament was attended by 5600 people.  The final tournament was attended by 25,000 people, with Jennings defeating Ross, an early large interest in Australian Hema (from a spectators point of view, at least0.  However, Jennings himself was then defeated by an Australian, Sergeant J. R. Donovan. Donovan eventually lost the title to a Professor Parker, who was the last person to hold the title, remaining unchallenged till his death in Sydney, in April, 1916.<ref name=WBH/>\n\nSome HEMA in Australia had been practiced, in the later part of the early 20th century, mainly in the context of the Australian Military. The Australian defence forces practiced sword drills, and some competitions and mounted sword combat. Additionally, the military sometimes would run \"Assault at Arms exhibitions\". HEMA in Australia was featured by soldiers performing feats of arms, often for charity, including in at least one case, [[Bartitsu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartitsu.org/index.php/tag/australia/ |title=Australia |website=Bartitsu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century revival===\nProbably the earliest [[Historical European martial arts|HEMA]] activity in Australia was that of Stephen Hand, Andrew Brew and Peter Radvan who started researching rapier and sword from period [[:wikt:manual|manuals]] in the mid 80s and teaching in around 1990. At this time, most European style combat in Australia was in the context of [[Historical reenactment in Australia]]. With few primary sources available, it was largely improvised with little relationship to authentic historical practice.<ref name=\"stoccata1\">{{cite web|url=http://stoccata.org/index.php/about-us/our-history |title=Our History |website=Stoccata.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>Martain, Tim \u201cCutting edge skills on offer at sharp end\u201d  Hobart Mercury 26 January 2005 p 16</ref> All three men were involved in Re-enactment groups but wanted to move more into the actual study of period combat techniques.\n\nStephen Hand originally from [[Hobart]], moved to Sydney where Brew and Radvan lived in 1989, and together they taught themselves and researched historical fencing from the few resources they had available. When they discovered the American scholar Patri Pugliese who collected, copied and sold historical fencing manuals, they gained access to more material but continued teaching as part of several historical reenactment groups. They started the Stoccata School of Defence, Gordon, Sydney in August 1998,  which was one of the first groups in Australia to approach [[Historical European martial arts|HEMA]] as a traditional art of defence in itself, rather than in the context of [[Historical reenactment|re-enacting]] a period or era. One of the early stars of Stoccata was Paul Wagner who rapidly rose to become a fourth instructor. Stephen and Paul have gone on to teach HEMA all over the world and to write a number of highly regarded books on various HEMA systems.\n\nAt around the same time Julian Clark, a modern fencing instructor was exploring historical fencing in Canberra and founded the Finesse Academy of Fencing.\n\nA few other clubs started to form around this time, with Scott McDonald forming the Australian College of Arms (ACA) in Brisbane and then restarting it in Melbourne when he moved there.<ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\" /> In 1995 a group of mostly Italian and German competitive fencers from Penrith Fencing Academy and Double Eagle at the German Austrian Club (Winter, Sanders, Ketibian, et al.) introduced training and formal competition in rapier and broadsword forming an unnamed group that endured until 2005 when it merged with the Sydney chapter of the Masonic Academy of Arms. Their use of historical weapons was done with modern electric fencing gear and led to some technical advances in modernizing medieval weapons to be electric by a swordsmith and historian in their academy leading to the first electric period weapons, including spears and axes.\n\nIn September 199 Scott McDonald organised one of the first open group events for historical fencing in Australia, named the first Historical Fencing Meeting (later to be called Historical Fencing Conferences) in Brisbane. At around the same time in Brisbane fencers who were part of the Historical Armed Combat Association (HACA) broke away to form their own fencing organisations. Notable among these was Bill Carew, who formed Collegium in Armis, which continues to operate to this day.\n\nHistorical Fencing Conferences were held yearly from 1999. International guests were invited to teach at these conferences, including Bob Charron, Ramon and Jeannette Martinez, Tom Leoni, and Milo Thurston. In 2000, the idea of an association for historical fencing  groups was raised. This became the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation, and formally started in 2002, with Stephen Hand as the first President.<ref name=\"stoccata1\" />\n\nIn Melbourne, after Scott McDonald moved to [[Brisbane]], the Melbourne Swordplay Guild was formed from those old members of the Australian College of Arms that wanted to continue. Initially the group used the Stoccata [[syllabus]] of [[George Silver]]. Members of the Melbourne Swordplay Guild went on to form three clubs in Melbourne, Die Fechtschule in 2005, GLECA (Glen Lachlann Estate College of Arms) and more recently, Fechtschule Victoria in 2013.<ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourneswordplay.com/about-us/ |title=About Us - Melbourne Swordplay Guild |publisher=Melbourneswordplay.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fechtschulevictoria.org.au/ |title=German longsword school, Melbourne Australia |publisher=Fechtschule Victoria |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref><ref>\"Swordplay's exciting Dance passion\" St Marys Star 15 January 2013 p 13</ref>\n\nBy 2004, Stoccata in Sydney had grown and had spawned a Tasmanian group, to become Australia's first interstate club.<ref>Hopkins, Clive ACTIVE The Sydney Morning Herald 18 June 2005 p 32,</ref> Stoccata now have ten branches Australia wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoccata.org/|title=Stoccata School of Defence Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOver the years seminars have benefited from visiting overseas experts in HEMA, including visits to Sydney and Melbourne by [[Arne Koets]], Guy Windsor (an expert in Italian Swordsmanship) Puck Curtis and most recently, Ingulf Kohlweiss, chief trainer of INDES Salzburg (Austria)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdtoknight.wordpress.com/2016/05/18/geekfest-festival-of-the-sword-episode-1-a-new-geekery/ |title=Geekfest (Festival of the Sword, Episode 1: A New Geekery) &#124; Nerd to Knight |website=Nerdtoknight.wordpress.com |date=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref> and Peter Smallridge from the UK.\n\nSome Rapier has developed within the Australian branch of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], the [[Kingdom of Lochac]], with some SCA members learning [[SCA fencing]] (which has become more based on period practice over time) and some SCA fencers in Melbourne starting separate schools of Historical swordsmanship distinct from the SCA.\n\nBy 2017, the interest in HEMA had grown to the point where there were clubs in most large cities in Australia <ref name=\"melbourneswordplay1\"/><ref>\u201cEn Garde For Safe Sword Play\u201d Coffs Coast Advocate 11 July 2015 p43</ref>\n\nSome equipment, mainly for HEMA Longsword is designed in Australia, with synthetic [[Sword|swords]] and protective [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]] made by WMA shop in Sydney, and [[Gambeson]]s for Longsword designed in Melbourne by AESIR.\n\n==National bodies and associations==\nThe Australian Historical Swordplay Federation  formed in 2002, and was the first group in Australia with the aim of being an umbrella group for groups practicing HEMA. The Federation was initially formed with 5 groups, Stoccata, ACA, Finesse, Gemeiner Academy and Prima Spada. This association ran for a number of years, conducted research and ran annual conferences. The Federation also hosted an annual conference and fought the anti-sword legislation in the Australian states of Victoria and NSW, helping to stop the banning of Swords in the latter state. Stephen Hand was the inaugural President, with the Presidency eventually going to Scott Nimmo in Melbourne.  However support and interest in the Federation petered out, and the Federation was wound up in 2014.\n\nWith the  activity of the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation winding down, another group was formed  by Scott Nimmo in Melbourne. Like the Federation, this group's aim was to act as an umbrella group for HEMA clubs active in Australia. This was the Western Martial Academies of Australia (WMAA). The WMAA has 10 groups as either members or affiliates, and liaises with groups over issues including syllabi, members and safety, and has organised over 50 tournaments.\n\nIn 2018 the Historical Fencing Association (HFA) another umbrella organisation, was formed by Jerry Gullotti along with fencers from Queensland, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Sydney. This group was formed to focus more heavily on the sporting aspects of HEMA, to provide a unified insurance system for member clubs, and assist clubs with standards for safety, rules, and starting new clubs. At the close of 2019 HFA had 17 member/affiliate groups.\n\n==Styles of combat==\nWithin HEMA in Australia, there is a wide variety of weapons and martial styles practiced. The 20 or so clubs in Australia have a wide area of focus and practice, using  various particular weapons and practicing various styles.  Some focus on one weapon and the use of it, while others will focus on a number of weapons in the same period, and others will focus on different periods. Early clubs in Australia focused primarily on [[rapier]], [[sidesword]] <nowiki/>and backsword, largely because of the interest of the practitioners, and the limited availability of English language or translated manuals at the time. Later clubs focused on Longsword, with some clubs focusing on the [[German school of fencing]] while others focused on the [[Italian school of swordsmanship]]. In recent times, there has also been a focus on Victorian era martial arts within HEMA in Australia, including [[Savate]], [[Canne de combat]], [[Sabre]],  [[Bartitsu]] and [[Boxing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/bartitsu-emerges-from-shadows-as-an-elementary-form-of-defence/story-fnay3ubk-1226654768379 |title=Bartitsu Emerges From shadows as an Elementary Form of Defence |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\n==Tournaments and conferences==\nThe annual Australian Historical Swordplay Convention, primarily a teaching event, was hosted and attended by diverse Australian groups from 1999 to 2006. It was held initially in Brisbane in 1999 and then 2006, Sydney in 2000 and 2004, Canberra in 2001 and 2005, the  Gold Coast in 2003 and Melbourne in 2002.\n\nIn 2009 Scott McDonald started what was to become one of the largest and longest running Historical European Martial Arts events, Swordplay. Swordplay initially started with all the groups in Brisbane competing, under a group of rules devised to be acceptable as much as possible, for all participants. The event is the longest running tournament of its kind in Australia, still running in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swordplayevent.id.au/?page_id=31 |title=Swordplay Event History &#124; Swordplay 2015 |website=Swordplayevent.id.au |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref> At times Swordplay has been referred to as the National tournament for HEMA, but the organisers themselves and many participants acknowledge there are now in fact a number of tournaments, and there currently is no official recognised \u201cnational\u201d event.\n\nIn May 2015, Sword Fight Gold Coast was run. Building of the Swordplay and Nordic models, Sword Fight was developed to provide a professional indoor event for Queensland historical fencers. Additionally, Sword Fight provided access to novice divisions using synthetic weapons in order to provide an inclusive environment for rookie fencers. In 2016 this event became the first tournament in Australia to include a women's division. <ref>Sword Fight Gold Coast - Sword Fighter http://www.swordfighter.com.au/sword-fight/</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Australia's Stoccata School of Defence hosted a revival of the World Broadsword Championship in Sydney, Australia. This event, held  throughout the late 19th century in England, the United States and Australia was last won by Professor Parker in Sydney in 1891. Parker was never challenged. The 2015 event was won by Paul Wagner of Sydney, also the current holder of the Glorianna Cup, the broadsword championship of Britain. Lewis Hand of Hobart, Australia won the junior title. In the tradition of the 19th century title, the championship is held in the home town of the current Champion. As such the championship was held again in Sydney in September 2017 with Paul Wagner once again claiming victory. In June 2018 the championship was held at the Australian Western Martial Arts Convention (AWMAC) in Sydney. It was won by Mark Holgate of the Adelaide Sword Academy who will host the next championship in Adelaide in 2019. AWMAC was hosted by Stoccata in Sydney Australia in June 2016. It built off a similar event run in Wellington, New Zealand in October 2015, and it was originally planned to hold this event on different sides of the Tasman Sea in alternate years. That hasn't proved successful and hence AWMAC will become an annual event, with the next one scheduled for June 2019. \n\nFechtschule Victoria ran their inaugural ''Festival Of The Sword'' in 2016, a large tournament and seminar with international guests, in Melbourne Australia.\n\nScholar Victoria ran their first ''Oktoberfecht Charity Tournament'' in 2018, a Meyer-centric competition in [[Dusack]], [[Sidesword]], and [[Longsword]], with all profits going to local charities.\n\nIn Western Australia, War in the West has been hosted by [http://housedarksun.com/ House Darksun] since 2015, and will be hosted by [http://ursamajorhema.com/ Ursa Major HEMA Academy] from 2019.\n\nIn Tasmania the Tasmanian Swordplay Symposium, a teaching and tournament event was held in early December 2017 and is planned to be an annual event.\n\n==Australian League Circuit for HEMA==\nAustralia has an official league circuit, the Australian Historical Fencing League (http://www.aushistoricalfencing.org/). Established in 2016 by a HEMA practitioner, Alexander Roberson, it allocates points for placement in recognised tournaments.

It was designed by [[Robin Dods]] and built in 1911 for Llewellyn Stephens. It is also known as Wewak. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|15798|Kitawah|601023|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nKitawah is a substantial timber residence constructed in 1911 for [[Brisbane]] solicitor Llewellyn Stephens and designed by prominent Queensland architect [[Robin Dods]] (of [[Hall and Dods]]). Kitawah is located upon a large block in East Brisbane that was originally part of Eastern Suburban Allotment 82, an area of {{convert|34|acre}} {{convert|1|rood|8|sqperch}}, initially acquired by William Wilson in December 1853. Stephens purchased subdivision \"H\", on the corner of Barker Street and Heath Street in 1909 and commissioned Dods to design a home for his young family.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nStephens was the eleventh child of [[Thomas Blacket Stephens]], a well-known figure in early Brisbane. Amongst other achievements, Thomas Blacket Stephens was the second [[Mayor of Brisbane]], a [[Member of the Legislative Council]], Colonial Treasurer, Secretary of Public Lands and proprietor of the [[Brisbane Courier]]. Llewellyn Stephens was born at the family home Cumbooqepa (the predecessor to the [[Cumbooquepa]] now part of [[Somerville House]]) in [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]] in 1873, just four years before his father died. He went on to become a solicitor and an Alderman in [[City of South Brisbane|South Brisbane]] and established his own firm [[Stephens and Tozer]] which still exists in Brisbane today.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nStephens married Gladys Ryan in 1905 and they lived at another house designed by Dods at 622 [[Vulture Street, Brisbane|Vulture Street]], East Brisbane until Kitawah was completed in 1911. They had two children at this stage and went on to have another four who were all born at Kitawah. Family members recall a quiet, family-oriented homelife. The children played games in the garden with neighbouring children and had a number of ponies, Gladys held a monthly \"at home\" when visitors came to call. The house was extended sometime between 1915 and 1919. As Dods had moved to [[Sydney]] in 1913, the nature of his involvement in the design of the extension is not clear. A wing was added to the north-west corner to accommodate bedroom space for the boys, substantially altering the roof-form and appearance of the house from Heath Street. Prior to the extension, the house had [[verandahs]] on the western, southern and eastern sides and the massive [[Rafter|crippled]] [[Hipped Roof|hipped roof]] presented an asymmetric front to the street. This asymmetry was maintained with the extension, adding another steep hip whose ridge was at a higher level than the hip on the western side. A [[gable]] roof was inserted into the central part of the roof and a decorative screen mounted upon the gable end became a central feature of this elevation. The front stairs were re-aligned to be centered with the new size of the verandah and as a consequence, no longer align with the front door.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nKitawah is a late example of Robin Dods' work in Brisbane, as the following year he moved to Sydney, where he did not have the same opportunity to undertake large domestic commissions. Dods was an exceptionally talented and original architect, introducing to Queensland the ''\"formal and philosophical ideas of both the British Arts and Crafts movement and Edwardian classicism\"''. At the same time, he refined and re-worked common elements of traditional Queensland houses and methods of construction and his houses exhibited a common-sense and often innovative approach to designing for the sub-tropical climate. Dods produced an impressive and high quality body of work in Queensland including hospital, commercial and ecclesiastical buildings as well as many residences. In the domestic realm his approach was widely imitated, in particular his planning and detailing of verandahs, external stairs, ventilated roofs and gable decorations.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nGladys Stephens continued to live at Kitawah after Llewellyn died in 1934. In 1936 a {{convert|28|sqperch|adj=on}} section of the block on the western side was sub-divided and sold and a further two roods, eight perches sub-divided into four blocks at the back of the block to the north was sold in 1938. Then in 1943 the Stephens family sold the house to the Parer family. The Parers renamed the house Wewak after one of their plantations in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The Parers further sub-divided the block in 1951, creating three {{convert|24|sqperch|adj=on}} blocks and one {{convert|27|sqperch|adj=on}} block, leaving Kitawah on a block with an area of {{convert|2|rood|9|sqperch}}. In 1969, the house was sold to Dr James Hemsley and the name of the house reverted to Kitawah. The property was sold in April 2012.<ref name=qhr/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourbrisbanepastandpresent.com/2012/04/kitawah-east-brisbane.html|title=Kitawah, East Brisbane|last=|first=|date=6 April 2012|website=Your Brisbane: Past and Present|publisher=|access-date=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Kitawah and front lawn.jpg|thumb|Residence and front lawn, 2015]]\nKitawah is a large and imposing timber house, high-set on stumps with extensive [[Veranda|verandahs]] and a massive [[Hip roof|hipped roof]] covered with Marseilles pattern [[terracotta]] tiles. The house has two tall masonry [[chimneys]] with high level openings and a skirt of timber [[Batten|battens]] infilling the spaces between the posts. Much of the garden setting is intact, Kitawah is located at the back of the large block with [[driveways]] to both sides. The front of the block is a large levelled and grassed area that was formerly a [[tennis court]]. The entry staircase is a prominent feature of this [[Elevation (architecture)|elevation]], along with a large weatherboard [[gable]] with a bold decorative screen in the plane of the [[Bargeboard|bargeboards]]. Stairs from two sides arrive on a central landing and then a single stair leads to the front verandah, the landing is covered with a simple timber [[pergola]] and post and beam-style timber \"arches\" mark the bottom of the staircases.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe verandahs of the house are characterised by substantial timber posts and a simple [[balustrade]]. At the north-eastern corner of the house the verandah enlarges to become a semi-enclosed room of generous proportions, with large vertical timber louvres infilling the space between the roof and the balustrade. A set of [[stairs]] leads into the back garden from this room on the southern side. The planning and spatial arrangement of the house is complex, revolving around a number of axes with interlocking rooms of various ceiling heights. A long central hall runs through the house from a small [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] just inside the front door. Three large bedrooms are located on the eastern side of the hall and are connected to a north-facing verandah which in turn, leads to the outdoor room on the north-eastern corner. Major public rooms are found on the western side of the hall.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe dining room and drawing room are linked by a wide opening with sliding timber doors. The dining room is the larger of the two rooms and has a large, dark brick, arched fireplace. The drawing room has an [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] located on the north side and has windows on two sides, not unlike an enlarged window seat but square in plan. All of these rooms are lined with timber vee-jay boarding and are stained up to the [[picture rail]] to simulate the richness of panelling. Bedrooms, hall and public rooms are all carpeted. The north-western corner of the house has now been enclosed with fibro-cement sheeting to form two large rooms, which are semi self-contained with basic bathroom facilities.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA secondary axis is formed on the western side of these rooms by a series of doors that link the kitchen to the dining room, drawing room and on to the front verandah. The back section of the house revolves around the large space of a well-proportioned back hall. The kitchen, bathroom, extra bedroom or study, former servant's room and back stairs all lead off this central space. The kitchen is located to the back of the dining room and has a large fireplace that is back-to-back with the fireplace of the dining room. A large walk-in pantry is located on the north-western corner of the kitchen. The kitchen, bathroom and toilet have recent fittings. The former servant's room is located up a short set of stairs adjacent to the back stairs.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA broad set of stairs with very wide timber treads leads into the wash house area on the ground floor. This area is distinctive of many of Dods' domestic designs with the hipped roof extending down to enclose a high, airy space accommodating a range of \"back of house\" functions in a semi-open space. This area is used as a laundry and wine cellar and contains the copper and a fireplace.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nKitawah was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nKitawah, constructed in 1912, is important in demonstrating the continued growth and development of the East Brisbane area in the early part of the 20th century and illustrating the way of life of affluent families over a period of eighty years.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''\n\nKitawah demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial timber urban residence.

It was designed by [[Robin Dods]] and built in 1911 for Llewellyn Stephens. It is also known as Wewak. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|15798|Kitawah|601023|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nKitawah is a substantial timber residence constructed in 1911 for [[Brisbane]] solicitor Llewellyn Stephens and designed by prominent Queensland architect [[Robin Dods]] (of [[Hall and Dods]]). Kitawah is located upon a large block in East Brisbane that was originally part of Eastern Suburban Allotment 82, an area of {{convert|34|acre}} {{convert|1|rood|8|sqperch}}, initially acquired by William Wilson in December 1853. Stephens purchased subdivision \"H\", on the corner of Barker Street and Heath Street in 1909 and commissioned Dods to design a home for his young family.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nStephens was the eleventh child of [[Thomas Blacket Stephens]], a well-known figure in early Brisbane. Amongst other achievements, Thomas Blacket Stephens was the second [[Mayor of Brisbane]], a [[Member of the Legislative Council]], Colonial Treasurer, Secretary of Public Lands and proprietor of the [[Brisbane Courier]]. Llewellyn Stephens was born at the family home Cumbooqepa (the predecessor to the [[Cumbooquepa]] now part of [[Somerville House]]) in [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]] in 1873, just four years before his father died. He went on to become a solicitor and an Alderman in [[City of South Brisbane|South Brisbane]] and established his own firm [[Stephens and Tozer]] which still exists in Brisbane today.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nStephens married Gladys Ryan in 1905 and they lived at another house designed by Dods at 622 [[Vulture Street, Brisbane|Vulture Street]], East Brisbane until Kitawah was completed in 1911. They had two children at this stage and went on to have another four who were all born at Kitawah. Family members recall a quiet, family-oriented homelife. The children played games in the garden with neighbouring children and had a number of ponies, Gladys held a monthly \"at home\" when visitors came to call. The house was extended sometime between 1915 and 1919. As Dods had moved to [[Sydney]] in 1913, the nature of his involvement in the design of the extension is not clear. A wing was added to the north-west corner to accommodate bedroom space for the boys, substantially altering the roof-form and appearance of the house from Heath Street. Prior to the extension, the house had [[verandahs]] on the western, southern and eastern sides and the massive [[Rafter|crippled]] [[Hipped Roof|hipped roof]] presented an asymmetric front to the street. This asymmetry was maintained with the extension, adding another steep hip whose ridge was at a higher level than the hip on the western side. A [[gable]] roof was inserted into the central part of the roof and a decorative screen mounted upon the gable end became a central feature of this elevation. The front stairs were re-aligned to be centered with the new size of the verandah and as a consequence, no longer align with the front door.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nKitawah is a late example of Robin Dods' work in Brisbane, as the following year he moved to Sydney where he did not have the same opportunity to undertake large domestic commissions. Dods was an exceptionally talented and original architect, introducing to Queensland the ''\"formal and philosophical ideas of both the British Arts and Crafts movement and Edwardian classicism\"''. At the same time, he refined and re-worked common elements of traditional Queensland houses and methods of construction and his houses exhibited a common-sense and often innovative approach to designing for the sub-tropical climate. Dods produced an impressive and high quality body of work in Queensland including hospital, commercial and ecclesiastical buildings as well as many residences. In the domestic realm his approach was widely imitated, in particular his planning and detailing of verandahs, external stairs, ventilated roofs and gable decorations.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nGladys Stephens continued to live at Kitawah after Llewellyn died in 1934. In 1936 a {{convert|28|sqperch|adj=on}} section of the block on the western side was sub-divided and sold and a further two roods, eight perches sub-divided into four blocks at the back of the block to the north was sold in 1938. Then in 1943 the Stephens family sold the house to the Parer family. The Parers renamed the house Wewak after one of their plantations in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The Parers further sub-divided the block in 1951, creating three {{convert|24|sqperch|adj=on}} blocks and one {{convert|27|sqperch|adj=on}} block, leaving Kitawah on a block with an area of {{convert|2|rood|9|sqperch}}. In 1969, the house was sold to Dr James Hemsley and the name of the house reverted to Kitawah. The property was sold in April 2012.<ref name=qhr/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourbrisbanepastandpresent.com/2012/04/kitawah-east-brisbane.html|title=Kitawah, East Brisbane|last=|first=|date=6 April 2012|website=Your Brisbane: Past and Present|publisher=|access-date=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Kitawah and front lawn.jpg|thumb|Residence and front lawn, 2015]]\nKitawah is a large and imposing timber house, high-set on stumps with extensive [[Veranda|verandahs]] and a massive [[Hip roof|hipped roof]] covered with Marseilles pattern [[terracotta]] tiles. The house has two tall masonry [[chimneys]] with high level openings and a skirt of timber [[Batten|battens]] infilling the spaces between the posts. Much of the garden setting is intact, Kitawah is located at the back of the large block with [[driveways]] to both sides. The front of the block is a large levelled and grassed area that was formerly a [[tennis court]]. The entry staircase is a prominent feature of this [[Elevation (architecture)|elevation]], along with a large weatherboard [[gable]] with a bold decorative screen in the plane of the [[Bargeboard|bargeboards]]. Stairs from two sides arrive on a central landing and then a single stair leads to the front verandah, the landing is covered with a simple timber [[pergola]] and post and beam-style timber \"arches\" mark the bottom of the staircases.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe verandahs of the house are characterised by substantial timber posts and a simple [[balustrade]]. At the north-eastern corner of the house the verandah enlarges to become a semi-enclosed room of generous proportions, with large vertical timber louvres infilling the space between the roof and the balustrade. A set of [[stairs]] leads into the back garden from this room on the southern side. The planning and spatial arrangement of the house is complex, revolving around a number of axes with interlocking rooms of various ceiling heights. A long central hall runs through the house from a small [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] just inside the front door. Three large bedrooms are located on the eastern side of the hall and are connected to a north-facing verandah which in turn, leads to the outdoor room on the north-eastern corner. Major public rooms are found on the western side of the hall.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe dining room and drawing room are linked by a wide opening with sliding timber doors. The dining room is the larger of the two rooms and has a large, dark brick, arched fireplace. The drawing room has an [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] located on the north side and has windows on two sides, not unlike an enlarged window seat but square in plan. All of these rooms are lined with timber vee-jay boarding and are stained up to the [[picture rail]] to simulate the richness of panelling. Bedrooms, hall and public rooms are all carpeted. The north-western corner of the house has now been enclosed with fibro-cement sheeting to form two large rooms, which are semi self-contained with basic bathroom facilities.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA secondary axis is formed on the western side of these rooms by a series of doors that link the kitchen to the dining room, drawing room and on to the front verandah. The back section of the house revolves around the large space of a well-proportioned back hall. The kitchen, bathroom, extra bedroom or study, former servant's room and back stairs all lead off this central space. The kitchen is located to the back of the dining room and has a large fireplace that is back-to-back with the fireplace of the dining room. A large walk-in pantry is located on the north-western corner of the kitchen. The kitchen, bathroom and toilet have recent fittings. The former servant's room is located up a short set of stairs adjacent to the back stairs.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA broad set of stairs with very wide timber treads leads into the wash house area on the ground floor. This area is distinctive of many of Dods' domestic designs with the hipped roof extending down to enclose a high, airy space accommodating a range of \"back of house\" functions in a semi-open space. This area is used as a laundry and wine cellar and contains the copper and a fireplace.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nKitawah was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nKitawah, constructed in 1912, is important in demonstrating the continued growth and development of the East Brisbane area in the early part of the 20th century and illustrating the way of life of affluent families over a period of eighty years.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''\n\nKitawah demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial timber urban residence.
