The technical manifestation of this undocumented doctrine was the research-and-development of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery; the former large enough to completely (or nearly) wipe out large cities and entire urbanized regions in one strike (i.e. with a single payload and a single aircraft). An example of this would be the creation of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1 orbital combat rocket]] (GRAU index 11A52) per the Resolution of the Council of Ministers issued on 23&nbsp;June 1960. With a starting weight of 2200&nbsp;tons and a nuclear warhead weighing 75&nbsp;tons, its estimated nuclear yield (though unknown exactly) could surpass that of a 150&nbsp;megaton-yield 40&nbsp;ton warhead delivered by a [[UR-500]] missile.\n\nThe development of such weapons also required mandatory and practical aerial bombardment methods as, for a high-yield (thermo-)nuclear explosion to reach maximal effect, the payload has to be detonated at an optimal height for the shock wave to reach the greatest force and range. In addition, ultra-large-yield thermonuclear bombs were considered by the Long Range Aviation units of the USSR, as their use fits the \"cause the greatest damage to the enemy with a minimal number of carriers (i.e. bombers)\" doctrine, while it was also necessary to consider the practical feasibility of such heavy thermonuclear weapons with reliably predictable characteristics. Before this, an underwater \"doomsday weapon\" considered by Soviet military and technical experts \u2013 essentially a giant torpedo launched by a dedicated nuclear submarine \u2013 was planned for development which would detonate its nuclear warhead near the US coast causing a huge tsunami. This project (known as the T-15 torpedo) was abandoned after more detailed consideration as its combat effectiveness was questionable.\n\n[[File:Tsar Bomba Revised.jpg|thumb|left|A Tsar Bomba-type casing on display at [[Sarov]]]]\n\nDesign work on the Tsar Bomba started from Autumn&nbsp;1954<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryparitet.com/vp/06/ |title=\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Superbomb |website=www.militaryparitet.com}}</ref> to autumn 1961 (with a two-year break from 1959-1960).

This somehow contradicts partially with the official history of the institute (now the [[All-Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics]]); the official history stated that the Ministry of Medium Engineering of the USSR order concerning the creation of a corresponding research institute was not signed until 5&nbsp;April 1955, with design work starting a few months later.

Tupolev appointed his deputy for weapon systems, Aleksandr Nadashkevich, as the head of the Topic. Subsequent analysis indicated that to carry such a heavy, concentrated load, the Tu-95 bomber carrying the Tsar Bomba needed to have its engines, bomb bay, suspension and release mechanisms seriously redesigned. The Tsar Bomba's dimensional and weight drawings were passed in the first half of 1955, together with its placement layout drawing. The Tsar Bomba's weight accounted for 15% the weight of its Tu-95 carrier as expected. The carrier, aside from having its fuel tanks and bomb bay doors removed, had its BD-206 bomb-holder replaced by a new, heavier beam-type BD7-95-242 (or BD-242) holder attached directly to the longitudinal weight-bearing beams. The problem of how to release the bomb was also solved; the bomb-holder would release all three of its locks in a synchronous fashion via electro-automatic mechanisms as required by safety protocols.\n\nThe CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a draft Joint Resolution on 12&nbsp;March 1956 on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'', which read:\n\n{{quote|Adopt a draft resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202''.\nParagraphs required for inclusion in the draft resolution:\n\n(a) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade [[Avraami Zavenyagin|Zavenyagin]]) and the Ministry of Defense of the USSR (Comrade [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]) at the end of the preparatory work for the test of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to report to the CPSU Central Committee on the situation;\n\n(b) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade Zavenyagin) to solve the issue of introducing a special stage of protection into the design of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to ensure disarming of the product in the event of a failure of the parachute system, as well as their proposals reported to the CPSU Central Committee.\n\nComrades [[Boris Vannikov|Vannikov]] and Kurchatov are assigned to edit the final version of this resolution.}}\n\nA Joint Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers (Nr. 357-28ss) was issued on 17&nbsp;March 1956 which mandated that OKB-156 begin conversion of a Tu-95 bomber into a high-yield nuclear bomb carrier. These works were carried out in the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] from May to September&nbsp;1956. The converted bomber, designated the '''Tu-95V''', was accepted for duty and was handed over for flight tests which, including a release of a mock-up \"superbomb\", were conducted under the command of Colonel S.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Kulikov until 1959 and passed without major issues.\n\nExplosive components and [[Explosive lens|lens]] were designed by a small team of [[List of Russian physicists|Russian physicists]] led by [[Yulii Khariton]] that included [[Andrei Sakharov]], Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov, and [[Yuri Trutnev (scientist)|Yuri Trutnev]]. Shortly after the Tsar Bomba was detonated, Sakharov began speaking out against [[nuclear weapon]]s, which culminated in him becoming a [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]].<ref name=\"Sakharov memoirs\" /><ref name=\"Adamsky and Smirnov\" />\n\n==Test==\nDespite the creation of the [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95V]] bomb-carrier aircraft, the actual test of the Tsar Bomba was postponed for political reasons; namely Khrushchev's visit to the United States and a pause in the Cold War. The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzin (situated in today's Ukraine) and was used as a training aircraft, therefore it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961 the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed and the aircraft itself covered with a [[Anti-flash white|special reflective white paint]]. Khrushchev himself announced the upcoming tests of the Tsar Bomba in his report at the 22nd&nbsp;Congress of the CPSU on 17&nbsp;October 1961.\n\n[[File:Ivan bomb.png|thumb|left|Site of the detonation]]\nThe Tsar Bomba was tested on 30&nbsp;October 1961, flown to its test site by Major [[Andrei Durnovtsev]]. The Tu-95 bombers were designed to carry much lighter and smaller weapons (at maximum 27&nbsp;tons ''after'' modernization<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/bomber/tu95v.html |title=Tu-95V |website=airway.ru}}</ref>), meaning the Tsar Bomba was too big to be placed on a missile and too heavy for the planes to transport it to the target with enough fuel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTaking off from the [[Olenya (air base)|Olenya]] airfield in the [[Kola Peninsula]], the release plane was accompanied by a [[Tu-16]] observer plane that took air samples and filmed the test.

This was probably due to the \"overlay\" of information about the excess of the actual explosion power over the estimated one by about 20% (in fact, by 14-17%) to the original design bomb power (100&nbsp;megatons, more precisely 101.5&nbsp;megatons). The newspaper Pravda added fuel to the fire of such rumors, on the pages of which it was officially stated that \u201cthe AN602 is the atomic weapon yesterday. Now even more powerful charges have been created.\u201d  In fact, the designers were considering the possibility of creating more powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] munitions (for example the warhead of the UR-500 missile with a capacity of 150&nbsp;megatons) but designs were developed no further.\n\nAt different times rumors circulated that the bomb power was reduced by 2&nbsp;times compared to the planned one as scientists were afraid of a self-sustaining fusion reaction involving the atmosphere and the ocean in the hydrogen reaction and subsequent oxygen burnout. Before [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the ''Trinity'' test]] in 1945, similar concerns had been expressed about the occurrence of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction in the atmosphere despite the contradiction of such a possibility to all known information about nuclear reactions. Just before that explosion, a young scientist who was nervous because of such fears was removed from the test site on the advice of doctors. In fact, detonation of neither the atmosphere nor the ocean is possible at any power of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] explosion.\n\nThere is a rumor about the extremely rapid development of the Tsar Bomba, claiming that it was completely constructed 112&nbsp;days after the commission of Khrushchev at the meeting on 10&nbsp;July 1961. In fact the development began in 1956.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Father of All Bombs]]\n*[[GBU-43/B MOAB]]\n* [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]\n* [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]], rumored Russian thermonuclear-capable autonomous underwater vehicle, CIA code-named ''Kanyon''\n* [[Cold War]]\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Soviet Union}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html |title=Tsar Bomba |editor-first=Carey |editor-last=Sublette |website=NuclearWeaponArchive.org |date=30 October 2018}}\n\n* {{cite media |medium=video |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=90 |title=Video of the Tsar Bomba delivery, blast and cloud}}{{cite web |title=Sonicbomb.com |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=39}}\n\n* {{youtube |title= ''Tsar Bomb'' \u2013 Official Chronicle |id=lfi0zYoqCY0}}\n\n* {{youtube |title=World's Biggest Bomb |id=uaoJFhQBb_s}}\n\n<!-- not needed: there is a uniform ~geohack link -- *[http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=73.807093,54.981766&spn=0.005852,0.037594&t=h&z=15&lci=lmc:wikipedia_en Google Maps] -->\n\n{{Russian and Soviet Aircraft Ordnance}}\n\n[[Category:1961 in military history]]\n[[Category:1961 in science]]\n[[Category:1961 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Explosions in 1961]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Novaya Zemlya]]\n[[Category:Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Russian inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet nuclear weapons testing]]\n[[Category:October 1961 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Expand Russian|\u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c-\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox weapon\n| name    =Tsar Bomba\n| image   = Tsar photo11.jpg\n| caption = The [[mushroom cloud]] of Tsar Bomba seen from a distance of {{cvt|161|km}}.

The technical manifestation of this undocumented doctrine was the research-and-development of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery; the former large enough to completely (or nearly) wipe out large cities and entire urbanized regions in one strike (i.e. with a single payload and a single aircraft). An example of this would be the creation of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1 orbital combat rocket]] (GRAU index 11A52) per the Resolution of the Council of Ministers issued on 23&nbsp;June 1960. With a starting weight of 2200&nbsp;tons and a nuclear warhead weighing 75&nbsp;tons, its estimated nuclear yield (though unknown exactly) could surpass that of a 150&nbsp;megaton-yield 40&nbsp;ton warhead delivered by a [[UR-500]] missile.\n\nThe development of such weapons also required mandatory and practical aerial bombardment methods as, for a high-yield (thermo-)nuclear explosion to reach maximal effect, the payload has to be detonated at an optimal height for the shock wave to reach the greatest force and range. In addition, ultra-large-yield thermonuclear bombs were considered by the Long Range Aviation units of the USSR, as their use fits the \"cause the greatest damage to the enemy with a minimal number of carriers (i.e. bombers)\" doctrine, while it was also necessary to consider the practical feasibility of such heavy thermonuclear weapons with reliably predictable characteristics. Before this, an underwater \"doomsday weapon\" considered by Soviet military and technical experts \u2013 essentially a giant torpedo launched by a dedicated nuclear submarine \u2013 was planned for development which would detonate its nuclear warhead near the US coast causing a huge tsunami. This project (known as the T-15 torpedo) was abandoned after more detailed consideration as its combat effectiveness was questionable.\n\n[[File:Tsar Bomba Revised.jpg|thumb|left|A Tsar Bomba-type casing on display at [[Sarov]]]]\n\nDesign work on the Tsar Bomba started from Autumn&nbsp;1954<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryparitet.com/vp/06/ |title=\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Superbomb |website=www.militaryparitet.com}}</ref> to autumn 1961 (with a two-year break from 1959-1960).

This somehow contradicts partially with the official history of the institute (now the [[All-Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics]]); the official history stated that the Ministry of Medium Engineering of the USSR order concerning the creation of a corresponding research institute was not signed until 5&nbsp;April 1955, with design work starting a few months later.

Tupolev appointed his deputy for weapon systems, Aleksandr Nadashkevich, as the head of the Topic. Subsequent analysis indicated that to carry such a heavy, concentrated load, the Tu-95 bomber carrying the Tsar Bomba needed to have its engines, bomb bay, suspension and release mechanisms seriously redesigned. The Tsar Bomba's dimensional and weight drawings were passed in the first half of 1955, together with its placement layout drawing. The Tsar Bomba's weight accounted for 15% the weight of its Tu-95 carrier as expected. The carrier, aside from having its fuel tanks and bomb bay doors removed, had its BD-206 bomb-holder replaced by a new, heavier beam-type BD7-95-242 (or BD-242) holder attached directly to the longitudinal weight-bearing beams. The problem of how to release the bomb was also solved; the bomb-holder would release all three of its locks in a synchronous fashion via electro-automatic mechanisms as required by safety protocols.\n\nThe CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a draft Joint Resolution on 12&nbsp;March 1956 on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'', which read:\n\n{{quote|Adopt a draft resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202''.\nParagraphs required for inclusion in the draft resolution:\n\n(a) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade [[Avraami Zavenyagin|Zavenyagin]]) and the Ministry of Defense of the USSR (Comrade [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]) at the end of the preparatory work for the test of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to report to the CPSU Central Committee on the situation;\n\n(b) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade Zavenyagin) to solve the issue of introducing a special stage of protection into the design of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to ensure disarming of the product in the event of a failure of the parachute system, as well as their proposals reported to the CPSU Central Committee.\n\nComrades [[Boris Vannikov|Vannikov]] and Kurchatov are assigned to edit the final version of this resolution.}}\n\nA Joint Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers (Nr. 357-28ss) was issued on 17&nbsp;March 1956 which mandated that OKB-156 begin conversion of a Tu-95 bomber into a high-yield nuclear bomb carrier. These works were carried out in the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] from May to September&nbsp;1956. The converted bomber, designated the '''Tu-95V''', was accepted for duty and was handed over for flight tests which, including a release of a mock-up \"superbomb\", were conducted under the command of Colonel S.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Kulikov until 1959 and passed without major issues.\n\nExplosive components and [[Explosive lens|lens]] were designed by a small team of [[List of Russian physicists|Russian physicists]] led by [[Yulii Khariton]] that included [[Andrei Sakharov]], Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov, and [[Yuri Trutnev (scientist)|Yuri Trutnev]].

The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzin (situated in today's Ukraine) and was used as a training aircraft, therefore it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961 the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed and the aircraft itself covered with a [[Anti-flash white|special reflective white paint]]. Khrushchev himself announced the upcoming tests of the Tsar Bomba in his report at the 22nd&nbsp;Congress of the CPSU on 17&nbsp;October 1961.\n\n[[File:Ivan bomb.png|thumb|left|Site of the detonation]]\nThe Tsar Bomba was tested on 30&nbsp;October 1961, flown to its test site by Major [[Andrei Durnovtsev]].

Since the moratorium was unilateral there was no multilateral legal obstacle. The U.S. had declared their own one-year unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests and as that year had expired, the US had already announced that it considered itself free to resume testing without further notice. Later it was stated that the U.S. had not resumed testing at the time of the ''Tsar Bomba'' test.<ref name=\"Sherman, Robert 2008\">{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Robert |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Chronology |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=30 May 2008}}</ref> That announcement was in error, as the US had in fact tested five times under [[Operation Nougat]] between the USSR's ending of the moratorium on 1&nbsp;October and the Tsar Bomba test on 30&nbsp;October.\n*\"World's Biggest Bomb\", a 2011 episode of the [[PBS]] documentary series ''[[Secrets of the Dead#Season 10 (2010\u20132011)|Secrets of the Dead]]'' produced by Blink Films & [[WNET]], chronicles the events leading to the detonations of [[Castle Bravo]] and the Tsar Bomba.\n\n== Hoaxes and myths ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nTest results of AN602 became the subject of rumors and hoaxes.\n\nSome publications claimed that the bomb's power reached 120&nbsp;megatons. This was probably due to the \"overlay\" of information about the excess of the actual explosion power over the estimated one by about 20% (in fact, by 14-17%) to the original design bomb power (100&nbsp;megatons, more precisely 101.5&nbsp;megatons). The newspaper Pravda added fuel to the fire of such rumors, on the pages of which it was officially stated that \u201cthe AN602 is the atomic weapon yesterday. Now even more powerful charges have been created.\u201d  In fact, the designers were considering the possibility of creating more powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] munitions (for example the warhead of the UR-500 missile with a capacity of 150&nbsp;megatons) but designs were developed no further.\n\nAt different times rumors circulated that the bomb power was reduced by 2&nbsp;times compared to the planned one as scientists were afraid of a self-sustaining fusion reaction involving the atmosphere and the ocean in the hydrogen reaction and subsequent oxygen burnout. Before [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the ''Trinity'' test]] in 1945, similar concerns had been expressed about the occurrence of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction in the atmosphere despite the contradiction of such a possibility to all known information about nuclear reactions. Just before that explosion, a young scientist who was nervous because of such fears was removed from the test site on the advice of doctors. In fact, detonation of neither the atmosphere nor the ocean is possible at any power of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] explosion.\n\nThere is a rumor about the extremely rapid development of the Tsar Bomba, claiming that it was completely constructed 112&nbsp;days after the commission of Khrushchev at the meeting on 10&nbsp;July 1961. In fact the development began in 1956.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Father of All Bombs]]\n*[[GBU-43/B MOAB]]\n* [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]\n* [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]], rumored Russian thermonuclear-capable autonomous underwater vehicle, CIA code-named ''Kanyon''\n* [[Cold War]]\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Soviet Union}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html |title=Tsar Bomba |editor-first=Carey |editor-last=Sublette |website=NuclearWeaponArchive.org |date=30 October 2018}}\n\n* {{cite media |medium=video |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=90 |title=Video of the Tsar Bomba delivery, blast and cloud}}{{cite web |title=Sonicbomb.com |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=39}}\n\n* {{youtube |title= ''Tsar Bomb'' \u2013 Official Chronicle |id=lfi0zYoqCY0}}\n\n* {{youtube |title=World's Biggest Bomb |id=uaoJFhQBb_s}}\n\n<!-- not needed: there is a uniform ~geohack link -- *[http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=73.807093,54.981766&spn=0.005852,0.037594&t=h&z=15&lci=lmc:wikipedia_en Google Maps] -->\n\n{{Russian and Soviet Aircraft Ordnance}}\n\n[[Category:1961 in military history]]\n[[Category:1961 in science]]\n[[Category:1961 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Explosions in 1961]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Novaya Zemlya]]\n[[Category:Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Russian inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet nuclear weapons testing]]\n[[Category:October 1961 events]]\n", "name_user": "98.1.39.160", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"}
