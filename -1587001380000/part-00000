The Guanche culture is characterized by an advanced cultural development, possibly related to the Berber cultural features imported from [[North Africa]] and a poor technological development, determined by the scarcity of raw materials, especially minerals that allow the extraction of metals.  The main activity was grazing, although the population were also engaged in agriculture, as well as fishing and the collection of shellfish from the shore or using fishing craft.<ref>[http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=2&idcap=10&idcon=178 La poblaci\u00f3n prehisp\u00e1nica: los guaches <small>- Gran Enciclopedia Virtual de Canarias</small>]</ref>\n\nAs for beliefs, the Guanche religion was polytheistic although the astral cult was widespread. Beside him there was an animistic religiosity that sacralized certain places, mainly rocks and mountains. Among the main Guanche gods could be highlighted; [[Acham\u00e1n]] (god of the sky and supreme creator), [[Chaxiraxi]] (mother goddess identified later with the [[Virgin of Candelaria]]), [[Magec]] (god of the sun) and [[Guayota]] (the demon) among many other gods and ancestral spirits. Especially singular was the cult to the dead, practicing the [[mummification]] of corpses. In addition, small lithic and clay figurines of the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic type associated with rituals, interpreted as idols, have appeared on the island. Among these stands out the so-called [[Guatimac|Idol of Guatimac]], which is believed to represent a genius or protective spirit.\n\n=== Territorial organisation before the conquest (The Guanches) ===\nThe title of ''[[mencey]]'' was given to the monarch or king of the Guanches of Tenerife, who governed a ''menceyato'' or kingdom. This role was later referred to as a \"captainship\" by the conquerors. [[Tinerfe|Tinerfe \"the Great\"]], son of the ''mencey'' Sunta, governed the island from Adeje in the south. However, upon his death, his nine children rebelled and argued bitterly about how to divide the island.\n\nTwo independent ''achimenceyatos'' were created on the island, and the island was divided into nine ''menceyatos.'' The ''menceyes'' within them formed what would be similar to municipalities today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canariasacross.com/islas/tenerife/situacion_historia.htm|title=El Portal de las Islas Canarias|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429072039/http://www.canariasacross.com/islas/tenerife/situacion_historia.htm|archive-date=29 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''menceyatos'' and their ''menceyes'' (ordered by the names of descendants of Tinerfe who ruled them) were the following:\n\n[[File:Tenerife preconquista.png|thumb|Territorial map of Tenerife before the conquest]]\n\n* [[Menceyato of Taoro|Taoro]].

For a century after the conquest, many new colonists settled on the island, including immigrants from the diverse territories of the growing [[Iberian Union|Spanish Empire]], such as [[Flanders]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]].\n\nAs the population grew, it cleared Tenerife's pine forests for fuel and to make fields for agriculture for crops both for local consumption and for export. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced in the 1520s as a commodity crop on major plantations; it was a labor-intensive crop in all phases of cultivation and processing. In the following centuries, planters cultivated wine grapes, [[cochineal]] for making dyes, and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] for use and export.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\">{{cite book |last=Hern\u00e1ndez|first=Pedro|title=Natura y Cultura de las Islas Canarias|publisher= Tafor|year=2003|isbn=978-84-932758-0-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Trade with the Americas ===\n[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Pargo]] (1678-1741), [[Privateer|corsair]] and [[merchant]] from Tenerife who participated in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] (the Spanish-American trade route).]]\nIn the commerce of the Canary Islands with the [[Americas]] of the 18th century, Tenerife was the hegemonic island, since it exceeded 50% of the number of ships and 60% of the tonnage.

From the start of the colonization of the [[New World]], many Spanish expeditions stopped at the island for supplies on their way to the Americas. They also recruited many ''tinerfe\u00f1os'' for their crews, who formed an integral part of the conquest expeditions. Others joined ships in search of better prospects. It is also important to note the exchange in plant and animal species that made those voyages.<ref name=\"emigracion\">{{in lang|es}} [http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/educacion/culturacanaria/emigracion/La_emigracion_canaria.htm \"Emigration to the Americas throughout history\"], Gobierno de Canarias</ref>\n\nAfter a century and a half of relative growth, based on the [[Vitis|grape growing]] sector, numerous families emigrated, especially to [[Venezuela]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] wanted to encourage population of underdeveloped zones in the Americas to pre-empt the occupation by foreign forces, as had happened with the English in [[Jamaica]] and the French in the [[French Guiana|Guianas]] and western [[Hispaniola]] (which the French renamed as Saint-Domingue). Canary Islanders, including many ''tinerfe\u00f1os,'' left for the New World.\n\nThe success in cultivation of new crops of the Americas, such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] in Venezuela and tobacco in Cuba, contributed to the population exodus from towns such as Buenavista del Norte, Vilaflor, or El Sauzal in the late 17th century. The village of [[San Carlos de Tenerife]] was founded in 1684 by Canary Islanders on [[Santo Domingo]]. The people from Tenerife were recruited for settlement to build up the town from encroachment by French colonists established in the western side of Hispaniola. Between 1720 and 1730, the Crown moved 176 families, including many ''tinerfe\u00f1os,'' to the Caribbean island of [[Puerto Rico]]. In 1726, about 25 island families migrated to the Americas to collaborate on the foundation of [[Montevideo]]. Four years later, in 1730, another group left that founded [[San Antonio]] the following year in what became [[Texas]]. Between 1777 and 1783, More islanders emigrated from Santa Cruz de Tenerife to settle in what became [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]], during the period when Spain ruled this former French territory west of the Mississippi River. Some groups went to Western or Spanish Florida.<ref name=\"emigracion\"/>\n\nTenerife saw the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] to [[Botany Bay]] in June 1787, which consisted of 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Commander of the fleet, Capt. [[Arthur Phillip]] and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape. On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\n\nEmigration to the Americas (mainly Cuba and Venezuela) continued during the 19th and early 20th century, due to the lack of economic opportunity and the relative isolation of the Canary Islands. Since the late 20th century, island protectionist economic laws and a strong development in the tourism industry have strengthened the economy and attracted new migrants. Tenerife has received numerous new residents, including the \"return\" of many descendants of some islanders who had departed five centuries before.<ref name=\"emigracion\"/>\n\n=== Military history ===\n[[File:Sir Horatio Nelson when wounded at Teneriffe.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Nelson wounded at Tenerife]]\nThe most notable conflict was the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|British invasion of Tenerife]] in 1797.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.ejercito.mde.es/ihycm/index-total.html?http://www.ejercito.mde.es/ihycm/chycm/canarias/museo.htm Instituto de Historia y Cultura Militar de Canarias]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 25 July 1797, Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] launched an attack at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, now the capital of the island.

However, Franco received information and in Gran Canaria agreed to collaborate in the military coup that would result in the [[Spanish Civil War]]; the Canaries fell to the Nationalists in July 1936. In the 1950s, the misery of the post-war years caused thousands of the island's inhabitants to emigrate to [[Cuba]] and other parts of Latin America.\n\nTenerife was the site of the deadliest accident ever in commercial aviation. Known as the \"[[Tenerife airport disaster]]\", in which 583 people were killed, the airliner collision took place on 27 March 1977, at [[Los Rodeos]] airport in the north of the island when two [[Boeing 747]] airplanes collided.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the so-called ''[[Riada de Tenerife of 2002]]'' took place on 31 March of that year. It was a phenomenon of cold drop characterized by the repeated fall of torrential rains accompanied by electrical apparatus, affecting the [[metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and extending in the NE direction towards the [[San Andr\u00e9s, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andr\u00e9s]] area.<ref>[http://www.eldia.es/2002-04-01/actualidad/actualidad1.htm Noticia sobre las lluvias torrenciales], diario [[El D\u00eda (Canarias)|El D\u00eda]]</ref> The rains caused 8 dead, 12 missing and dozens of wounded.<ref>[http://www.eldia.es/2002-04-09/actualidad/actualidad1.htm Ya son OCHO los muertos.

These fractures lie along the structural axes of the island itself, forming themselves from the Alpine [[orogeny]] during the [[Tertiary Period]] due to the movements of the [[African plate]].\n\nUnderwater fissural eruptions originated from the [[pillow lava]], which are produced by the rapid cooling of the magma when it comes in contact with water, obtaining their peculiar shape. This pillow-lava accumulated, constructing the base of the island underneath the sea. As this accumulation approached the surface of the water, gases erupted from the magma due to the reduction of the surrounding pressure. The volcanic eruptions became more violent and had a more explosive character, and resulted in the forming of peculiar geological fragments.<ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/>\n\nAfter long-term accumulation of these fragments, the birth of the island occurred at the end of the [[Miocene|Miocene Epoch]]. The zones on Tenerife known as [[Macizo de Teno]], [[Macizo de Anaga]] and [[Macizo de Adeje]] were formed seven million years ago; these formations are called the ''Ancient Basaltic Series'' or ''Series I''. These zones were actually three separate islands lying in what is now the extreme west, east, and south of Tenerife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=2&lang=1&s=1&ID=160|title=Informaci\u00f3n del Cabildo de Tenerife|work=idecnet.com|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109002153/http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=2&lang=1&s=1&ID=160|archivedate=9 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA second volcanic cycle called the ''Post-Miocene Formations'' or ''Latest Series II, III, IV'' began three million years ago.

This new structure, called the ''Pre-Ca\u00f1adas Structure'' (''Edificio pre-Ca\u00f1adas''), would be the foundation for what is called the ''Ca\u00f1adas Structure I''. The Ca\u00f1adas Structure I experienced various collapses and emitted explosive material that produced the area known as ''Bandas del sur'' (in the present-day south-southeast of Tenerife).<ref name=enciclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=36&idcap=58&idcon=330 |title=Origen y formaci\u00f3n - TENERIFE - (GEVIC) Gran Enciclopedia Virtual Islas Canarias |author=|date=|work=gevic.net|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the ruins of Ca\u00f1adas Structure I emerged ''Ca\u00f1adas Structure II'', which was {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and emerged with intense explosive activity. About one million years ago, the Dorsal Range (''Cordillera Dorsal'') emerged by means of fissural volcanic activity occurring amidst the remains of the older Ancient Basaltic Series (Series I).

Semidesert areas exist in the south with drought-resistant plants. Other areas range from those protected and enclosed in mountains such as Monta\u00f1a Roja and Monta\u00f1a Pelada, the valleys and forests with subtropical vegetation and climate, to those with deep gorges and precipices such as at Anaga and Teno.\n\n==== Central heights ====\nThe principal structures in Tenerife, make the central highlands, with the Teide\u2013[[Pico Viejo]] complex and the Las Ca\u00f1adas areas as most prominent. It comprises a semi-[[caldera]] of about {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} in area, originated by several geological processes explained under the ''Origin and formation'' section. The area is partially occupied by the Teide-Pico Viejo strato-volcano and completed by the materials emitted in the different eruptions that took place. A known formation called ''Los Azulejos'', composed by green-tinted rocks were created by hydrothermal processes.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nSouth of La Caldera is Guajara Mountain, which has an elevation of {{convert|2718|m|0|abbr=off}}, rising above Teide National Park.

Due to the age of its material (5.7&nbsp;million years), its deep erosive processes, and the dense network of [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] piercing the massif, its surface exposes numerous outcroppings of both [[phonolite|phonolitic]] and [[trachyte|trachytic]] origin. A large number of steep-walled gorges are present, penetrating deeply into the terrain. Vertical cuts dominate the Anagan coast, with infrequent beaches of rocks or black sand between them; the few that exist generally coincide with the mouths of gorges.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=enciclopedia/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\n[[File:Punta teno.jpg|thumb|right|Teno massif\u2014Cliffs of the Giants area]]\n\nThe Teno massif (''[[Macizo de Teno]]'') is located on the northwestern edge of the island. Like Anaga, it includes an area of outcroppings and deep gorges formed by erosion. However, the materials here are older (about 7.4&nbsp;million years old). Mount Gala represents its highest elevation at {{convert|1342|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The most unusual landscape of this massif is found on its southern coast, where the [[Acantilados de Los Gigantes]] (\"Cliffs of the Giants\") present vertical walls reaching heights of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} in some places.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nThe Adeje massif (''Macizo de Adeje'') is situated on the southern tip of the island. Its main landmark is the Roque del Conde (\"Count's Rock\"), with an elevation of {{convert|1001|m|ft|abbr=off}}. This massif is not as impressive as the others due to its diminished initial structure, since in addition to with the site's greater geologic age it has experienced severe erosion of its material, thereby losing its original appearance and extent.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\n==== Dorsals ====\nThe Dorsal mountain [[ridge]] or ''Dorsal of Pedro Gil'' covers the area from the start at Mount La Esperanza, at a height of about {{convert|750|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, to the center of the island, near the ''Caldera de Las Ca\u00f1adas'', with Iza\u00f1a, as its highest point at {{convert|2390|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ([[Atmospheric pressure|MSLP]]). These mountains have been created due to basaltic fissural volcanism through one of the axis that gave birth to the vulcanism of this area.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nThe Abeque Dorsal was formed by a chain of volcanoes that join the Teno with the central insular peak of Teide-Pico Viejo starting from another of the three axis of Tenerife's geological structures. On this dorsal we find the historic volcano of Chinyero whose last eruption happened in 1909.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nThe South Dorsal or ''Dorsal of Adeje'' is part of the last of the structural axis.

The most important are [[Valle de La Orotava]] and [[Valle de G\u00fc\u00edmar]], both formed by the mass sliding of great quantities of material towards the sea, creating a depression of the land. Other valleys tend to be between hills formed by deposits of sediments from nearby slopes, or simply wide ravines which in their evolution have become typical valleys.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nTenerife has a large number of ravines, which are a characteristic element of the landscape, caused by erosion from surface runoff over a long period.

The industrial sector which shares in 5.80 percent is a growing activity in the island, vis-a-vis the new possibilities created by technological advances.

Tenerife had 4,171,384 arrivals that year, excluding the numbers for Spanish tourists which make up an additional 30 percent of total arrivals. According to last year's Canarian Statistics Centre's (ISTAC) Report on Tourism the greatest number of tourists from any one country come from the United Kingdom, with more than 3,980,000 tourists in 2014. In second place comes Germany followed by Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, Russia and Austria.\n\nTourism is more prevalent in the south of the island, which is hotter and drier and has many well developed resorts such as [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]]. More recently coastal development has spread northwards from Playa de las Americas and now encompasses the former small enclave of La Caleta (a favoured place for naturist tourists). After the ''Moratoria'' act passed by the Canarian Parliament in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, no more hotels should be built on the island unless they are classified as 5 star-quality and comprise different services such as golf courses or convention facilities. This act was passed with the goal of improving the standard of tourism service and promoting environmentally conscious development.\n[[File:Playa de las americas Tenerife.jpg|thumb|Evening sunset at the beach Playa De Las Americas, Tenerife]]\nThe area known as Costa Adeje (Las Am\u00e9ricas-Callao Salvaje) has many facilities and leisure opportunities besides sea and sand, such as shopping centres, golf courses, restaurants, water parks (the most well-known being [[Siam Park (Tenerife)|Siam Park]]), animal parks, and a theatre suitable for musicals or a convention centre.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn the more lush and green north of the island the main development for tourism has been in the town of [[Puerto de la Cruz]]. The town itself has kept some of its old-harbour town charm mixed with northern European influences. Still, the tourist boom in the 1960s changed the outlook of the town, making it cosy and cosmopolitan at the same time, and a favourite for the more mature traveller (notably the German and Spanish tourist). Puerto de la Cruz is also home to the controversial Seaworld-owned zoo, [[Loro Parque]], which won the Trip Advisers travellers choice award,<ref name=\"tripadvisor.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Attractions-cZoos-g1|title=Best Zoos - the World - TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Awards|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}</ref> but which has also been accused of mistreatment of the animals in its captivity, including orcas<ref name=\"Daily Express article - Water park accused of 'cruelty' as images emerge of killer whales covered in scars\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/600445/British-tourists-Canary-Islands-Spanish-water-park-SeaWorld-orca-cruelty|title=Water park accused of 'cruelty' as images emerge of killer whales covered in scars|website=www.express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> and is currently boycotted by major travel agents including [[TUI Group]] (Thomson) and [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook]].<ref name=\"BBC article - Thomas Cook axes trips to SeaWorld over animal welfare concerns\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44997389|title=Thomas Cook axes trips to SeaWorld over animal welfare concerns|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th and most of the 20th century large numbers of foreign tourists came, especially British, showing interest in the agriculture of the islands. With the world wars, this sector weakened, but the start of the second half of the century brought new forms of tourism. Due to its warm climate, the first emphasis was on Puerto de la Cruz, and for all the attractions that the Valle de la Orotava offered, and following the promotion sun and beaches, around 1980 the tourist boom was born in south Tenerife. The emphasis was on cities like Arona or Adeje, shifting to tourist centres like Los Cristianos or Playa de Las Americas, which now house 65 percent of the hotels on the island. Tenerife receives more than 5 million tourists every year; of the \u0421anary islands Tenerife is the most popular. However, this data also reflects the large quantity of resources that tourism consumes (space, energy, water etc.)<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/>\n<ref>[http://www.webtenerife.com/NR/rdonlyres/AC31568D-687A-4B60-9FC2-389A90B1A728/6179/webTurismoenCifras2007.xls#'Men\u00fa Principal'!A1 Estad\u00edsticas de Turismo de Tenerife]{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}\n</ref>\n\nCurrently, the municipality of [[Adeje]] in the south of the island has the highest concentration of 5 star hotels in [[Europe]]<ref>[https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2018/06/las-nuevas-catedrales-del-turismo-en-tenerife/ Las nuevas \u2018catedrales\u2019 del turismo en Tenerife]</ref> and also has what is considered the best luxury hotel in Spain according to ''World Travel Awards''.<ref>[http://www.eleconomista.es/evasion/noticias/9254628/07/18/Tenerife-tiene-el-mejor-hotel-de-lujo-de-Espana.html Tenerife tiene el mejor hotel de lujo de Espa\u00f1a]</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture and fishing ===\n[[File:Botanico 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The Botanic Gardens in Puerto de la Cruz]]\nSince tourism dominates the Tenerifan economy, the service sector is the largest.

Agriculture contributes less than 10 percent of the island's GDP, but its contribution is vital, as it also generates indirect benefits, by maintaining the rural appearance, and supporting Tenerifan cultural values.\n\nAgriculture is centred on the northern slopes, and is also determined by the altitude as well as orientation: in the coastal zone, tomatoes and bananas are cultivated, usually in plastic enclosures, these high yield products are for export to mainland Spain and the rest of Europe; in the drier intermediate zone, potatoes, tobacco and maize are grown, whilst in the south, onions are important.<ref name=naturaycultura/>\n[[File:Anaga (Tenerife).jpg|thumb|left|View of fields around Anaga]]\n\nBananas are a particularly important crop, as Tenerife grows more bananas than the other Canary Islands, with a current annual production of about 150,000 tons, down from the peak production of 200,000 tons in 1986. More than 90 percent of the total is destined for the international market, and banana growing occupies about 4200 hectares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.platanodecanarias.net/esp/asprocan/asprocan.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120628215847/http://www.platanodecanarias.net/esp/asprocan/asprocan.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2012|title=Estad\u00edsticas de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Pl\u00e1tanos de Canarias (ASPROCAN)|work=platanodecanarias.net|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> After the banana the most important crops are, in order of importance, tomatoes, grapes, potatoes and flowers. Fishing is also a major contributor to the Tenerifan economy, as the Canaries are Spain's second most important fishing grounds.\n\n===Energy===\nAs of 2009, Tenerife had 910MW of electrical generation capacity, which is mostly powered from petroleum-derived fuels. The island had 37MW of wind turbines and 79MW of solar panels.<ref>http://atlastenerife.es/portalweb/en/isla-de-infraestructuras/power-generation-and-transportation</ref>\n\n=== Industry and commerce ===\nCommerce in Tenerife plays a significant role in the economy which is enhanced by tourism, representing almost 20 percent of the GDP, with the commercial center Santa Cruz de Tenerife generating most of the earnings. Although there are a diversity of industrial estates that exist on the island, the most important industrial activity is petroleum, representing 10 percent of the island's GDP, again largely due to the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife with its refinery. It provides petroliferous products not only to the Canaries archipelago but is also an active in the markets of the Iberian Peninsula, Africa and South America.\n\n== Historical heritage ==\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Castillo o Torre de San Andr\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|[[Castle of San Andr\u00e9s]], declared of National Tourist Interest Center]]\nThere are many monuments on the island, especially from the time after the conquest, we can highlight the [[Cathedral of La Laguna|Cathedral of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]], the [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna)|Church of the Conception of La Laguna]] and the Church of the Conception in the capital.

The processions are accompanied by local dances, local dishes, folkloric activities, local arts and crafts, local sports, and the wearing of traditional dress of Tenerife (''trajes de mago'').\n\nThe origins of these events can be attributed to the parties and celebrations held by the richest classes of the island, who would gather to venerate their patron saints, to which they attributed good harvests, fertile lands, plentiful rainfall, the curing of sicknesses and ending of epidemics, etc. They would thus give homage to these saints by consuming and sharing the fruits of their harvest, which included the locally cultivated wines. These have developed into processions to mark festivals dedicated to [[Saint Mark]] in [[Tegueste]], where the wagons are decorated with the fruits of the earth (seeds, cereals, flowers, etc.); to [[Saint Isidore the Laborer]] in Los Realejos; to Saint Isidore the Laborer and [[Maria Torribia]] (''Saint Mary of the Head'') in La Orotava; the [[Romer\u00eda Regional de San Benito Abad]] in La Laguna; [[Virgin of Candelaria]] in Candelaria; [[Saint Roch]] in Garachico; [[Saint Augustine]] in [[Arafo]]; and the [[Romer\u00eda del Socorro]] in G\u00fc\u00edmar.\n\n==== Holiday of the Virgin of Candelaria ====\nThe [[Virgin of Candelaria]] is the patron of the Canary Islands; a feast is held in her honor two times a year, in February and August. The Pilgrimage-Offering to the Virgin of Candelaria is celebrated every 14 August in this event is a tradition that representations of all municipalities of the island and also of all the Canary archipelago come to make offerings to their patron. Another significant act of the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria is called \"''Walk to Candelaria''\" held on the night of 14 to 15 August in which the faithful make pilgrimage on foot from various parts of the island, even coming from other islands to arrive at [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Villa Mariana de Candelaria]].\n\nOn 2 February we celebrate the feast of the Candelaria. Also on this day come to town many members of the Virgin.\n\n==== Holiday of the Cristo de La Laguna ====\nIt is celebrated every 14 September in honor of a much venerated image of Christ in the Archipelago, the [[Cristo de La Laguna]], is held in the city of [[San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]].\n\n==== Corpus Christi ====\n[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|right|Soil Tapestry in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (Town Square) in La Orotava]]\nThe religious festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] is particularly important, and is traditionally celebrated with floral carpets laid in the streets.

In 1530, the [[Dominican Order]] established a chair of philosophy at the convent of [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna)|La Concepci\u00f3n de La Laguna]]. Still, until well into the 18th century Tenerife was largely without institutions of education.\n[[File:UniversityLaLaguna.JPG|thumb|left|[[University of La Laguna]], the oldest and largest university in the Canary Islands]]\nSuch institutions finally began to develop thanks to the work of the Real Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de Amigos del Pa\u00eds (\"Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country\"), which established several schools in San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna. The first of these was an institute of secondary education established in 1846 to fill the gap left by the closure of the Universidad de San Fernando (''see [[University of La Laguna]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ull.es/portal/viewcategory.aspx?code=16|title=Universidad de La Laguna|work=ull.es|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111211540/http://www.ull.es/portal/viewcategory.aspx?code=16|archivedate=11 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn 1850 annex to this building was the Escuela Normal Elemental, the archipelago's first teachers' college or [[normal school]], which became the Escuela Normal Superior de Magisterio from 1866 onward. These were the only institutions of higher education until the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] created several institutions. A turning point came around the time of the rise of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. From 1929 to 1933 the number of schools nearly doubled.\n\nShortly after this, though, the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the following dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] constituted a considerable reversal. Education in the hands of religious orders had a certain importance on the island until the 1970 Ley General de Educaci\u00f3n (\"General Law of Education\") shifted the balance from religiously based education to public education. Public schools continued their advance during and after the post-Franco [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. Tenerife today has 301 centers of childhood education ([[preschool]]s), 297 primary schools, 140 secondary schools and 86 [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/educacion/DGC/DirCentros/scripts/default.asp?categoria=37|title=Buscador de centros educativos y oferta educativa - Consejer\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n y Universidades - Gobierno de Canarias|author=|date=|work=gobcan.es|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> There are also five universities or [[post-graduate education|post-graduate]] schools, the [[University of La Laguna]], the [[Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia]] (National University of Distance Learning), the [[Universidad Internacional Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo]] (Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo International University), the [[Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio]] (University of Alfonso X the Wise) and the [[Universidad de Vic]] (Escuela Universitaria de Turismo de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, \"University School of Tourism of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\").

It serves inter-insular flights as well as national and European flights, and for the last two years, a weekly service to [[Venezuela]]. Reina Sof\u00eda Airport (south) is the busiest Airport in Tenerife, ranking 7th in Spain. It typically serves the mass of regular and vacation charter flights constantly arriving from most of Europe. Los Rodeos Airport was also the site of the [[Tenerife Airport Disaster]], which killed 583 people and is the deadliest aviation accident in history.\n\nThe other way to arrive on Tenerife is by ferry, either to Santa Cruz de Tenerife or Los Cristianos, near Playa de Las Am\u00e9ricas.\n\nA network consisting of two fast, toll-free motorways (TF1 and TF5) encircles nearly the entire island, linking all the main towns and resorts with the metropolitan area. The exception is in the West, from Adeje to Icod de los Vinos, which is traversed by a smaller winding mountain road. However, plans are in progress to complete the motorway, which caused a heavy debate between the environmentalists and the local businessmen.\n\nAway from the major motorways, there is a network of secondary and communal roads, varying from wide to steep, winding narrow roads, mainly unlit and often with drops on either side of the main carriageway surface.\n[[File:Teno Cape.JPG|thumb|right|Teno, the westernmost point in the island]]\nPublic transport on the island is provided by an extensive network of buses and run by [[TITSA]], who operate a fleet of modern, air-conditioned buses.<ref>\"Tenerife's main bus service, TITSA, is efficient and covers the island well.

Each has flights to the capitals of the other islands and to cities throughout Europe, as well as to [[Caracas]], [[Dakar]], and Miami. Overall, Tenerife has the highest annual passenger count and the greatest number of arrivals, made more popular by the frequency of cheap flights from many European destinations. Tenerife North Airport was the site of the [[Tenerife airport disaster|deadliest accident in aviation history]]: in 1977 two [[Boeing 747]]s collided on a runway, killing 583 people.

The Guanche culture is characterized by an advanced cultural development, possibly related to the Berber cultural features imported from [[North Africa]] and a poor technological development, determined by the scarcity of raw materials, especially minerals that allow the extraction of metals.  The main activity was grazing, although the population were also engaged in agriculture, as well as fishing and the collection of shellfish from the shore or using fishing craft.<ref>[http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=2&idcap=10&idcon=178 La poblaci\u00f3n prehisp\u00e1nica: los guaches <small>- Gran Enciclopedia Virtual de Canarias</small>]</ref>\n\nAs for beliefs, the Guanche religion was polytheistic although the astral cult was widespread. Beside him there was an animistic religiosity that sacralized certain places, mainly rocks and mountains. Among the main Guanche gods could be highlighted; [[Acham\u00e1n]] (god of the sky and supreme creator), [[Chaxiraxi]] (mother goddess identified later with the [[Virgin of Candelaria]]), [[Magec]] (god of the sun) and [[Guayota]] (the demon) among many other gods and ancestral spirits. Especially singular was the cult to the dead, practicing the [[mummification]] of corpses. In addition, small lithic and clay figurines of the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic type associated with rituals, interpreted as idols, have appeared on the island. Among these stands out the so-called [[Guatimac|Idol of Guatimac]], which is believed to represent a genius or protective spirit.\n\n=== Territorial organisation before the conquest (The Guanches) ===\nThe title of ''[[mencey]]'' was given to the monarch or king of the Guanches of Tenerife, who governed a ''menceyato'' or kingdom. This role was later referred to as a \"captainship\" by the conquerors. [[Tinerfe|Tinerfe \"the Great\"]], son of the ''mencey'' Sunta, governed the island from Adeje in the south. However, upon his death, his nine children rebelled and argued bitterly about how to divide the island.\n\nTwo independent ''achimenceyatos'' were created on the island, and the island was divided into nine ''menceyatos.'' The ''menceyes'' within them formed what would be similar to municipalities today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canariasacross.com/islas/tenerife/situacion_historia.htm|title=El Portal de las Islas Canarias|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429072039/http://www.canariasacross.com/islas/tenerife/situacion_historia.htm|archive-date=29 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''menceyatos'' and their ''menceyes'' (ordered by the names of descendants of Tinerfe who ruled them) were the following:\n\n[[File:Tenerife preconquista.png|thumb|Territorial map of Tenerife before the conquest]]\n\n* [[Menceyato of Taoro|Taoro]].

The first included the ''menceyatos'' of Anaga, G\u00fc\u00edmar, Abona and Adeje. The second group consisted of the people of Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icoden and Daute. Those opposed to the conquest fought the invaders tenaciously, resisting their rule for two years. Castillian forces under the ''[[Adelantado]]'' (\"military governor\") de Lugo suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Guanches in the [[First Battle of Acentejo]] on 31 May 1494, but defeated them at the [[Second Battle of Acentejo]] on 25 December 1494.

The new colonists intermarried with the local native population. For a century after the conquest, many new colonists settled on the island, including immigrants from the diverse territories of the growing [[Iberian Union|Spanish Empire]], such as [[Flanders]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]].\n\nAs the population grew, it cleared Tenerife's pine forests for fuel and to make fields for agriculture for crops both for local consumption and for export. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced in the 1520s as a commodity crop on major plantations; it was a labor-intensive crop in all phases of cultivation and processing. In the following centuries, planters cultivated wine grapes, [[cochineal]] for making dyes, and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] for use and export.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\">{{cite book |last=Hern\u00e1ndez|first=Pedro|title=Natura y Cultura de las Islas Canarias|publisher= Tafor|year=2003|isbn=978-84-932758-0-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Trade with the Americas ===\n[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Pargo]] (1678-1741), [[Privateer|corsair]] and [[merchant]] from Tenerife who participated in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] (the Spanish-American trade route).]]\nIn the commerce of the Canary Islands with the [[Americas]] of the 18th century, Tenerife was the hegemonic island, since it exceeded 50% of the number of ships and 60% of the tonnage.

From the start of the colonization of the [[New World]], many Spanish expeditions stopped at the island for supplies on their way to the Americas. They also recruited many ''tinerfe\u00f1os'' for their crews, who formed an integral part of the conquest expeditions. Others joined ships in search of better prospects. It is also important to note the exchange in plant and animal species that made those voyages.<ref name=\"emigracion\">{{in lang|es}} [http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/educacion/culturacanaria/emigracion/La_emigracion_canaria.htm \"Emigration to the Americas throughout history\"], Gobierno de Canarias</ref>\n\nAfter a century and a half of relative growth, based on the [[Vitis|grape growing]] sector, numerous families emigrated, especially to [[Venezuela]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] wanted to encourage population of underdeveloped zones in the Americas to pre-empt the occupation by foreign forces, as had happened with the English in [[Jamaica]] and the French in the [[French Guiana|Guianas]] and western [[Hispaniola]] (which the French renamed as Saint-Domingue). Canary Islanders, including many ''tinerfe\u00f1os,'' left for the New World.\n\nThe success in cultivation of new crops of the Americas, such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] in Venezuela and tobacco in Cuba, contributed to the population exodus from towns such as Buenavista del Norte, Vilaflor, or El Sauzal in the late 17th century. The village of [[San Carlos de Tenerife]] was founded in 1684 by Canary Islanders on [[Santo Domingo]]. The people from Tenerife were recruited for settlement to build up the town from encroachment by French colonists established in the western side of Hispaniola. Between 1720 and 1730, the Crown moved 176 families, including many ''tinerfe\u00f1os,'' to the Caribbean island of [[Puerto Rico]]. In 1726, about 25 island families migrated to the Americas to collaborate on the foundation of [[Montevideo]]. Four years later, in 1730, another group left that founded [[San Antonio]] the following year in what became [[Texas]]. Between 1777 and 1783, More islanders emigrated from Santa Cruz de Tenerife to settle in what became [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]], during the period when Spain ruled this former French territory west of the Mississippi River. Some groups went to Western or Spanish Florida.<ref name=\"emigracion\"/>\n\nTenerife saw the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] to [[Botany Bay]] in June 1787, which consisted of 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Commander of the fleet, Capt. [[Arthur Phillip]] and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape. On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\n\nEmigration to the Americas (mainly Cuba and Venezuela) continued during the 19th and early 20th century, due to the lack of economic opportunity and the relative isolation of the Canary Islands. Since the late 20th century, island protectionist economic laws and a strong development in the tourism industry have strengthened the economy and attracted new migrants. Tenerife has received numerous new residents, including the \"return\" of many descendants of some islanders who had departed five centuries before.<ref name=\"emigracion\"/>\n\n=== Military history ===\n[[File:Sir Horatio Nelson when wounded at Teneriffe.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Nelson wounded at Tenerife]]\nThe most notable conflict was the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|British invasion of Tenerife]] in 1797.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.ejercito.mde.es/ihycm/index-total.html?http://www.ejercito.mde.es/ihycm/chycm/canarias/museo.htm Instituto de Historia y Cultura Militar de Canarias]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 25 July 1797, Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] launched an attack at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, now the capital of the island.

In the 1950s, the misery of the post-war years caused thousands of the island's inhabitants to emigrate to [[Cuba]] and other parts of Latin America.\n\nTenerife was the site of the deadliest accident ever in commercial aviation.

The cold sea currents of the Canary Islands also have a cooling effect on the coasts and its beaches, while the topography of the landscape plays a role in climatic differences on the island with its many valleys.

The lowest recorded temperature in downtown Santa Cruz is {{convert|8.1|C|F|1}}, the coldest month on record still had a relatively mild average temperature of {{convert|15.8|C|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=coo&l=C449C&datos=det&x=C449C&m=13&v=TMB|title=Santa Cruz All Time Records|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=10 December 2015}}</ref> Summer temperatures are highest in August, with an average high of {{convert|29|C|F}} in Santa Cruz, similar to those of places as far north as [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]], because of the greater maritime influence. At a higher elevation in La Laguna, the climate transitions to a [[Mediterranean climate]] with higher precipitation amounts and lower temperatures year round. The climate of Santa Cruz is very typical of the Canaries, albeit only slightly warmer than the [[Las Palmas#Climate|climate]] of Las Palmas.\n\nMajor climatic contrasts on the island are evident, especially during the winter months when it is possible to enjoy the warm sunshine on the coast and experience snow within miles, {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on Teide.<ref name=islaaisla>{{cite book | last = Gonz\u00e1lez Morales | first = Alejandro | title = Canarias isla a isla (clima) | publisher = Centro de la Cultura Popular Canaria| year = 2000 | isbn = 84-7926-357-1}}</ref> There are also major contrasts at low altitude, where the climate ranges from [[arid climate|arid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BWh'') on the southeastern side represented by Santa Cruz de Tenerife to [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa''/''Csb'') on the northwestern side in Buena Vista del Norte and La Orotava.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Zonas/Santa%20Cruz%20Laguna/Mas%20sobre%20Tenerife/Geografia/Climatologia/Contraste%20norte-sur.htm?Lang=es&sig=true|title=Turismo Tenerife: Alojamiento, Carnaval, Actividades... - Tenerife|author=|date=|work=webtenerife.com|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe north and south of Tenerife similarly have different climatic characteristics because of the [[rain shadow]] effect. The windward northwestern side of the island receives 73 percent of all precipitation on the island, and the relative humidity of the air is superior and the insolation inferior. The pluviometric maximums are registered on the windward side at an average altitude of between {{convert|1000|and|1,200|m|ft|abbr=off}}, almost exclusively in the [[La Orotava]] mountain range.<ref name=islaaisla/> Although climatic differences in rainfall and sunshine on the island exist, overall annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is low and the summer months from May to September are normally completely dry.

These fractures lie along the structural axes of the island itself, forming themselves from the Alpine [[orogeny]] during the [[Tertiary Period]] due to the movements of the [[African plate]].\n\nUnderwater fissural eruptions originated from the [[pillow lava]], which are produced by the rapid cooling of the magma when it comes in contact with water, obtaining their peculiar shape. This pillow-lava accumulated, constructing the base of the island underneath the sea. As this accumulation approached the surface of the water, gases erupted from the magma due to the reduction of the surrounding pressure. The volcanic eruptions became more violent and had a more explosive character, and resulted in the forming of peculiar geological fragments.<ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/>\n\nAfter long-term accumulation of these fragments, the birth of the island occurred at the end of the [[Miocene|Miocene Epoch]]. The zones on Tenerife known as [[Macizo de Teno]], [[Macizo de Anaga]] and [[Macizo de Adeje]] were formed seven million years ago; these formations are called the ''Ancient Basaltic Series'' or ''Series I''. These zones were actually three separate islands lying in what is now the extreme west, east, and south of Tenerife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=2&lang=1&s=1&ID=160|title=Informaci\u00f3n del Cabildo de Tenerife|work=idecnet.com|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109002153/http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=2&lang=1&s=1&ID=160|archivedate=9 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA second volcanic cycle called the ''Post-Miocene Formations'' or ''Latest Series II, III, IV'' began three million years ago. This was a much more intense volcanic cycle, which united the Macizo de Teno, Macizo de Anaga and Macizo de Adeje into one island. This new structure, called the ''Pre-Ca\u00f1adas Structure'' (''Edificio pre-Ca\u00f1adas''), would be the foundation for what is called the ''Ca\u00f1adas Structure I''. The Ca\u00f1adas Structure I experienced various collapses and emitted explosive material that produced the area known as ''Bandas del sur'' (in the present-day south-southeast of Tenerife).<ref name=enciclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=36&idcap=58&idcon=330 |title=Origen y formaci\u00f3n - TENERIFE - (GEVIC) Gran Enciclopedia Virtual Islas Canarias |author=|date=|work=gevic.net|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the ruins of Ca\u00f1adas Structure I emerged ''Ca\u00f1adas Structure II'', which was {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and emerged with intense explosive activity. About one million years ago, the Dorsal Range (''Cordillera Dorsal'') emerged by means of fissural volcanic activity occurring amidst the remains of the older Ancient Basaltic Series (Series I).

Semidesert areas exist in the south with drought-resistant plants. Other areas range from those protected and enclosed in mountains such as Monta\u00f1a Roja and Monta\u00f1a Pelada, the valleys and forests with subtropical vegetation and climate, to those with deep gorges and precipices such as at Anaga and Teno.\n\n==== Central heights ====\nThe principal structures in Tenerife, make the central highlands, with the Teide\u2013[[Pico Viejo]] complex and the Las Ca\u00f1adas areas as most prominent. It comprises a semi-[[caldera]] of about {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} in area, originated by several geological processes explained under the ''Origin and formation'' section. The area is partially occupied by the Teide-Pico Viejo strato-volcano and completed by the materials emitted in the different eruptions that took place. A known formation called ''Los Azulejos'', composed by green-tinted rocks were created by hydrothermal processes.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nSouth of La Caldera is Guajara Mountain, which has an elevation of {{convert|2718|m|0|abbr=off}}, rising above Teide National Park.

Due to the age of its material (5.7&nbsp;million years), its deep erosive processes, and the dense network of [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] piercing the massif, its surface exposes numerous outcroppings of both [[phonolite|phonolitic]] and [[trachyte|trachytic]] origin. A large number of steep-walled gorges are present, penetrating deeply into the terrain. Vertical cuts dominate the Anagan coast, with infrequent beaches of rocks or black sand between them; the few that exist generally coincide with the mouths of gorges.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=enciclopedia/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\n[[File:Punta teno.jpg|thumb|right|Teno massif\u2014Cliffs of the Giants area]]\n\nThe Teno massif (''[[Macizo de Teno]]'') is located on the northwestern edge of the island. Like Anaga, it includes an area of outcroppings and deep gorges formed by erosion. However, the materials here are older (about 7.4&nbsp;million years old). Mount Gala represents its highest elevation at {{convert|1342|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The most unusual landscape of this massif is found on its southern coast, where the [[Acantilados de Los Gigantes]] (\"Cliffs of the Giants\") present vertical walls reaching heights of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} in some places.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nThe Adeje massif (''Macizo de Adeje'') is situated on the southern tip of the island. Its main landmark is the Roque del Conde (\"Count's Rock\"), with an elevation of {{convert|1001|m|ft|abbr=off}}. This massif is not as impressive as the others due to its diminished initial structure, since in addition to with the site's greater geologic age it has experienced severe erosion of its material, thereby losing its original appearance and extent.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\n==== Dorsals ====\nThe Dorsal mountain [[ridge]] or ''Dorsal of Pedro Gil'' covers the area from the start at Mount La Esperanza, at a height of about {{convert|750|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, to the center of the island, near the ''Caldera de Las Ca\u00f1adas'', with Iza\u00f1a, as its highest point at {{convert|2390|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ([[Atmospheric pressure|MSLP]]). These mountains have been created due to basaltic fissural volcanism through one of the axis that gave birth to the vulcanism of this area.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nThe Abeque Dorsal was formed by a chain of volcanoes that join the Teno with the central insular peak of Teide-Pico Viejo starting from another of the three axis of Tenerife's geological structures.

The most important are [[Valle de La Orotava]] and [[Valle de G\u00fc\u00edmar]], both formed by the mass sliding of great quantities of material towards the sea, creating a depression of the land. Other valleys tend to be between hills formed by deposits of sediments from nearby slopes, or simply wide ravines which in their evolution have become typical valleys.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\nTenerife has a large number of ravines, which are a characteristic element of the landscape, caused by erosion from surface runoff over a long period. Notable ravines include Ruiz, Fasnia and G\u00fc\u00edmar, Infierno, and Erques, all of which have been designated protected natural areas by Canarian institutions.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n[[File:Panom-puerto.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|Panorama of [[Valle de La Orotava]]]]\n\n==== Coastline ====\nThe coasts of Tenerife are typically rugged and steep, particularly on the north of the island. However, the island has {{convert|67.14|km|2|abbr=off}} of beaches, such as the one at [[El M\u00e9dano]], surpassed only in this respect by the island of [[Fuerteventura]].<ref>[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/territorio_ambiente/area_01_frame.html Estad\u00edsticas del Gobierno de Canarias]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323155813/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=%2Fistac%2Festadisticas%2Fterritorio_ambiente%2Farea_01_frame.html |date=23 March 2010 }}</ref> There are many black sand pebble beaches on the northern coast, while on the south and south-west coast of the island, the beaches have typically much finer and clearer sand with lighter tones.<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/><ref name=\"enciclopedia\"/><ref name=\"islaaisla\"/>\n\n==== Volcanic tubes ====\n[[Lava tubes]] are volcanic caves usually in the form of tunnels formed within lava flows more or less fluid reogen\u00e9tica duration of the activity. Among the many existing volcanic tubes on the island stands out the [[Cueva del Viento]], located in the northern town of [[Icod de los Vinos]], which is the largest volcanic tunnel in the [[European Union]] and one of the largest in the world, although for a long time was even considered the largest in the world.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe island of Tenerife has a remarkable [[ecological diversity]] in spite of its small surface area, which is a consequence of the special environmental conditions on the island, where its distinct orography modifies the general climatic conditions at a local level, producing a significant variety of [[microclimates]]. This diversity of natural microclimates and, therefore, habitats, means that a rich and diverse [[flora]] (1400 species of plants) exists on the island, with well over a hundred entirely endemic to Tenerife.<ref name=florayfauna>{{cite web|url=http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=3&lang=1&s=1&ID=164|title=Cabildo de Tenerife (Flora y Fauna: introducci\u00f3n)|work=idecnet.com|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307145049/http://www.puntoinfo.idecnet.com/index.php?sectionID=3&lang=1&s=1&ID=164|archivedate=7 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Endemic species include [[Viper's bugloss]], Teide white broom, Teide violet etc. The [[fauna]] of the island has many endemic invertebrates and unique reptile, bird and mammal species. The fauna of Tenerife includes some 400 species of fish, 56 birds, five reptiles, two amphibians, 13 land mammals and several thousand [[invertebrate]]s, along with several species of [[sea turtle]]s, whales and dolphins.\n\nThe vegetation of Tenerife can be divided into six major zones that are directly related to altitude and the direction in which they face.\n\n* Lower xerophytic zone: {{convert|0|-|700|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

Transition zone with moderate temperatures and rainfall, but the area has been deteriorated by human activity. Many endemic species: juniper (''[[Juniperus cedrus]]''), dragon trees (''[[Dracaena draco]]''), palm trees (''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''), etc.\n* [[Laurel forest]]: {{convert|500|-|1,000|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Dense forest of large trees, descendants of [[tertiary]] age flora, situated in a zone of frequent rainfall and mists. A wide variety of species with abundant undergrowth of bushes, herbaceous plants, and ferns. Laurels, holly (''[[Ilex canariensis]]''), ebony (''[[Persea indica]]''), mahogany (''[[Apollonias barbujana]]''), etc.\n* Wax myrtle: {{convert|1,000|-|1,500|m|ft|abbr=off}}. A dryer vegetation, poorer in species. It replaces the degraded laurel forest. Of great forestry importance. Wax myrtles (''[[Myrica faya]]''), tree heath (''[[Erica arborea]]''), holly, etc.\n* Pine forest: {{convert|800|-|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Open pine forest, with thin and unvaried undergrowth. Canary Island pine (''[[Pinus canariensis]]''), broom (''[[Genista canariensis]]''), rock rose (''[[Cistus]]'' spp.), etc.\n* High mountain: over {{convert|2,000|m|abbr=off}}.

The industrial sector which shares in 5.80 percent is a growing activity in the island, vis-a-vis the new possibilities created by technological advances.

Tenerife had 4,171,384 arrivals that year, excluding the numbers for Spanish tourists which make up an additional 30 percent of total arrivals. According to last year's Canarian Statistics Centre's (ISTAC) Report on Tourism the greatest number of tourists from any one country come from the United Kingdom, with more than 3,980,000 tourists in 2014. In second place comes Germany followed by Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, Russia and Austria.\n\nTourism is more prevalent in the south of the island, which is hotter and drier and has many well developed resorts such as [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]]. More recently coastal development has spread northwards from Playa de las Americas and now encompasses the former small enclave of La Caleta (a favoured place for naturist tourists). After the ''Moratoria'' act passed by the Canarian Parliament in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, no more hotels should be built on the island unless they are classified as 5 star-quality and comprise different services such as golf courses or convention facilities. This act was passed with the goal of improving the standard of tourism service and promoting environmentally conscious development.\n[[File:Playa de las americas Tenerife.jpg|thumb|Evening sunset at the beach Playa De Las Americas, Tenerife]]\nThe area known as Costa Adeje (Las Am\u00e9ricas-Callao Salvaje) has many facilities and leisure opportunities besides sea and sand, such as shopping centres, golf courses, restaurants, water parks (the most well-known being [[Siam Park (Tenerife)|Siam Park]]), animal parks, and a theatre suitable for musicals or a convention centre.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn the more lush and green north of the island the main development for tourism has been in the town of [[Puerto de la Cruz]]. The town itself has kept some of its old-harbour town charm mixed with northern European influences. Still, the tourist boom in the 1960s changed the outlook of the town, making it cosy and cosmopolitan at the same time, and a favourite for the more mature traveller (notably the German and Spanish tourist). Puerto de la Cruz is also home to the controversial Seaworld-owned zoo, [[Loro Parque]], which won the Trip Advisers travellers choice award,<ref name=\"tripadvisor.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Attractions-cZoos-g1|title=Best Zoos - the World - TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Awards|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}</ref> but which has also been accused of mistreatment of the animals in its captivity, including orcas<ref name=\"Daily Express article - Water park accused of 'cruelty' as images emerge of killer whales covered in scars\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/600445/British-tourists-Canary-Islands-Spanish-water-park-SeaWorld-orca-cruelty|title=Water park accused of 'cruelty' as images emerge of killer whales covered in scars|website=www.express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> and is currently boycotted by major travel agents including [[TUI Group]] (Thomson) and [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook]].<ref name=\"BBC article - Thomas Cook axes trips to SeaWorld over animal welfare concerns\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44997389|title=Thomas Cook axes trips to SeaWorld over animal welfare concerns|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th and most of the 20th century large numbers of foreign tourists came, especially British, showing interest in the agriculture of the islands. With the world wars, this sector weakened, but the start of the second half of the century brought new forms of tourism. Due to its warm climate, the first emphasis was on Puerto de la Cruz, and for all the attractions that the Valle de la Orotava offered, and following the promotion sun and beaches, around 1980 the tourist boom was born in south Tenerife. The emphasis was on cities like Arona or Adeje, shifting to tourist centres like Los Cristianos or Playa de Las Americas, which now house 65 percent of the hotels on the island. Tenerife receives more than 5 million tourists every year; of the \u0421anary islands Tenerife is the most popular. However, this data also reflects the large quantity of resources that tourism consumes (space, energy, water etc.)<ref name=\"naturaycultura\"/>\n<ref>[http://www.webtenerife.com/NR/rdonlyres/AC31568D-687A-4B60-9FC2-389A90B1A728/6179/webTurismoenCifras2007.xls#'Men\u00fa Principal'!A1 Estad\u00edsticas de Turismo de Tenerife]{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}\n</ref>\n\nCurrently, the municipality of [[Adeje]] in the south of the island has the highest concentration of 5 star hotels in [[Europe]]<ref>[https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2018/06/las-nuevas-catedrales-del-turismo-en-tenerife/ Las nuevas \u2018catedrales\u2019 del turismo en Tenerife]</ref> and also has what is considered the best luxury hotel in Spain according to ''World Travel Awards''.<ref>[http://www.eleconomista.es/evasion/noticias/9254628/07/18/Tenerife-tiene-el-mejor-hotel-de-lujo-de-Espana.html Tenerife tiene el mejor hotel de lujo de Espa\u00f1a]</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture and fishing ===\n[[File:Botanico 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The Botanic Gardens in Puerto de la Cruz]]\nSince tourism dominates the Tenerifan economy, the service sector is the largest.

Agriculture contributes less than 10 percent of the island's GDP, but its contribution is vital, as it also generates indirect benefits, by maintaining the rural appearance, and supporting Tenerifan cultural values.\n\nAgriculture is centred on the northern slopes, and is also determined by the altitude as well as orientation: in the coastal zone, tomatoes and bananas are cultivated, usually in plastic enclosures, these high yield products are for export to mainland Spain and the rest of Europe; in the drier intermediate zone, potatoes, tobacco and maize are grown, whilst in the south, onions are important.<ref name=naturaycultura/>\n[[File:Anaga (Tenerife).jpg|thumb|left|View of fields around Anaga]]\n\nBananas are a particularly important crop, as Tenerife grows more bananas than the other Canary Islands, with a current annual production of about 150,000 tons, down from the peak production of 200,000 tons in 1986. More than 90 percent of the total is destined for the international market, and banana growing occupies about 4200 hectares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.platanodecanarias.net/esp/asprocan/asprocan.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120628215847/http://www.platanodecanarias.net/esp/asprocan/asprocan.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2012|title=Estad\u00edsticas de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Pl\u00e1tanos de Canarias (ASPROCAN)|work=platanodecanarias.net|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> After the banana the most important crops are, in order of importance, tomatoes, grapes, potatoes and flowers. Fishing is also a major contributor to the Tenerifan economy, as the Canaries are Spain's second most important fishing grounds.\n\n===Energy===\nAs of 2009, Tenerife had 910MW of electrical generation capacity, which is mostly powered from petroleum-derived fuels. The island had 37MW of wind turbines and 79MW of solar panels.<ref>http://atlastenerife.es/portalweb/en/isla-de-infraestructuras/power-generation-and-transportation</ref>\n\n=== Industry and commerce ===\nCommerce in Tenerife plays a significant role in the economy which is enhanced by tourism, representing almost 20 percent of the GDP, with the commercial center Santa Cruz de Tenerife generating most of the earnings. Although there are a diversity of industrial estates that exist on the island, the most important industrial activity is petroleum, representing 10 percent of the island's GDP, again largely due to the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife with its refinery. It provides petroliferous products not only to the Canaries archipelago but is also an active in the markets of the Iberian Peninsula, Africa and South America.\n\n== Historical heritage ==\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Castillo o Torre de San Andr\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|[[Castle of San Andr\u00e9s]], declared of National Tourist Interest Center]]\nThere are many monuments on the island, especially from the time after the conquest, we can highlight the [[Cathedral of La Laguna|Cathedral of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]], the [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna)|Church of the Conception of La Laguna]] and the Church of the Conception in the capital.

Also noteworthy on the island are the defensive castles located in the village of [[San Andr\u00e9s, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andr\u00e9s]], as well as many others throughout the island.\n\nAmong other impressive structures is the [[Auditorio de Tenerife]], one of the most modern in Spain, which can be found at the entry port to the capital (in the southern part of Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife).

The processions are accompanied by local dances, local dishes, folkloric activities, local arts and crafts, local sports, and the wearing of traditional dress of Tenerife (''trajes de mago'').\n\nThe origins of these events can be attributed to the parties and celebrations held by the richest classes of the island, who would gather to venerate their patron saints, to which they attributed good harvests, fertile lands, plentiful rainfall, the curing of sicknesses and ending of epidemics, etc. They would thus give homage to these saints by consuming and sharing the fruits of their harvest, which included the locally cultivated wines. These have developed into processions to mark festivals dedicated to [[Saint Mark]] in [[Tegueste]], where the wagons are decorated with the fruits of the earth (seeds, cereals, flowers, etc.); to [[Saint Isidore the Laborer]] in Los Realejos; to Saint Isidore the Laborer and [[Maria Torribia]] (''Saint Mary of the Head'') in La Orotava; the [[Romer\u00eda Regional de San Benito Abad]] in La Laguna; [[Virgin of Candelaria]] in Candelaria; [[Saint Roch]] in Garachico; [[Saint Augustine]] in [[Arafo]]; and the [[Romer\u00eda del Socorro]] in G\u00fc\u00edmar.\n\n==== Holiday of the Virgin of Candelaria ====\nThe [[Virgin of Candelaria]] is the patron of the Canary Islands; a feast is held in her honor two times a year, in February and August. The Pilgrimage-Offering to the Virgin of Candelaria is celebrated every 14 August in this event is a tradition that representations of all municipalities of the island and also of all the Canary archipelago come to make offerings to their patron. Another significant act of the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria is called \"''Walk to Candelaria''\" held on the night of 14 to 15 August in which the faithful make pilgrimage on foot from various parts of the island, even coming from other islands to arrive at [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Villa Mariana de Candelaria]].\n\nOn 2 February we celebrate the feast of the Candelaria. Also on this day come to town many members of the Virgin.\n\n==== Holiday of the Cristo de La Laguna ====\nIt is celebrated every 14 September in honor of a much venerated image of Christ in the Archipelago, the [[Cristo de La Laguna]], is held in the city of [[San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]].\n\n==== Corpus Christi ====\n[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|right|Soil Tapestry in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (Town Square) in La Orotava]]\nThe religious festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] is particularly important, and is traditionally celebrated with floral carpets laid in the streets.

In 1530, the [[Dominican Order]] established a chair of philosophy at the convent of [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna)|La Concepci\u00f3n de La Laguna]]. Still, until well into the 18th century Tenerife was largely without institutions of education.\n[[File:UniversityLaLaguna.JPG|thumb|left|[[University of La Laguna]], the oldest and largest university in the Canary Islands]]\nSuch institutions finally began to develop thanks to the work of the Real Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de Amigos del Pa\u00eds (\"Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country\"), which established several schools in San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna. The first of these was an institute of secondary education established in 1846 to fill the gap left by the closure of the Universidad de San Fernando (''see [[University of La Laguna]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ull.es/portal/viewcategory.aspx?code=16|title=Universidad de La Laguna|work=ull.es|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111211540/http://www.ull.es/portal/viewcategory.aspx?code=16|archivedate=11 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn 1850 annex to this building was the Escuela Normal Elemental, the archipelago's first teachers' college or [[normal school]], which became the Escuela Normal Superior de Magisterio from 1866 onward. These were the only institutions of higher education until the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] created several institutions. A turning point came around the time of the rise of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. From 1929 to 1933 the number of schools nearly doubled.\n\nShortly after this, though, the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the following dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] constituted a considerable reversal. Education in the hands of religious orders had a certain importance on the island until the 1970 Ley General de Educaci\u00f3n (\"General Law of Education\") shifted the balance from religiously based education to public education. Public schools continued their advance during and after the post-Franco [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. Tenerife today has 301 centers of childhood education ([[preschool]]s), 297 primary schools, 140 secondary schools and 86 [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/educacion/DGC/DirCentros/scripts/default.asp?categoria=37|title=Buscador de centros educativos y oferta educativa - Consejer\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n y Universidades - Gobierno de Canarias|author=|date=|work=gobcan.es|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> There are also five universities or [[post-graduate education|post-graduate]] schools, the [[University of La Laguna]], the [[Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia]] (National University of Distance Learning), the [[Universidad Internacional Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo]] (Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo International University), the [[Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio]] (University of Alfonso X the Wise) and the [[Universidad de Vic]] (Escuela Universitaria de Turismo de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, \"University School of Tourism of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\").

Reina Sof\u00eda Airport (south) is the busiest Airport in Tenerife, ranking 7th in Spain. It typically serves the mass of regular and vacation charter flights constantly arriving from most of Europe. Los Rodeos Airport was also the site of the [[Tenerife Airport Disaster]], which killed 583 people and is the deadliest aviation accident in history.\n\nThe other way to arrive on Tenerife is by ferry, either to Santa Cruz de Tenerife or Los Cristianos, near Playa de Las Am\u00e9ricas.\n\nA network consisting of two fast, toll-free motorways (TF1 and TF5) encircles nearly the entire island, linking all the main towns and resorts with the metropolitan area. The exception is in the West, from Adeje to Icod de los Vinos, which is traversed by a smaller winding mountain road. However, plans are in progress to complete the motorway, which caused a heavy debate between the environmentalists and the local businessmen.\n\nAway from the major motorways, there is a network of secondary and communal roads, varying from wide to steep, winding narrow roads, mainly unlit and often with drops on either side of the main carriageway surface.\n[[File:Teno Cape.JPG|thumb|right|Teno, the westernmost point in the island]]\nPublic transport on the island is provided by an extensive network of buses and run by [[TITSA]], who operate a fleet of modern, air-conditioned buses.<ref>\"Tenerife's main bus service, TITSA, is efficient and covers the island well.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run.

This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

The front suspension uses [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]], while the rear is a [[Multi-link suspension|multi-link]] setup.\n\nWhen the DeLorean first arrived in the US, the car had a higher than expected wheel gap in the front suspension.  The nose-high appearance is the result of poor quality coil springs.  Despite having significantly less weight in the front, the front and rear springs had the same spring rate and also used lower quality steel which resulted in the nose-high look.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9 |date= 2014 | pages = 83}}</ref>  Some people have erroneously cited a last minute change in US bumper height requirements led DMC to raise the vehicle just prior to delivery, however this is not true.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe model]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Both ''{{lang|es|negro}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|noir}}'' (and therefore also ''{{lang|fr|n\u00e8gre}}'' and ''nigger'') ultimately come from ''{{lang|la|nigrum}}'', the [[accusative case]] singular masculine and neuter <!-- Nouns in Western Romance languages typically come from the accusative case, rather than the nominative case that we quote in English. --> form of the [[Latin]] masculine adjective ''{{lang|la|niger}}'', meaning \"black\" or \"[[dark]]\".<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nigger |title=''Nigger'' Usage Note |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=May 17, 2015 }}</ref> Its first recorded use dates to 1574, and its first recorded derogatory use to 1775.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Christopher|title=Bestial Traces: Race, Sexuality, Animality|date=2013|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-4520-8|page=91|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_Z54563cYpoC&pg=PA91#v=onepage|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Patricia T.

The largest armada of Turkic traders and missionaries settled in Tharangambadi (Nagapattinam), Karaikal, Muthupet, Koothanallur, Podakkudi and Athikkadai. Rowthers settled in that area expanding into an Islamic community of almost one million.
