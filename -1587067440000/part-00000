Rask was drafted 21st overall in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Rask won the [[Vezina Trophy]] as the league's top goaltender during the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]]. In 2011, Rask won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the Bruins. He is the older brother of [[Joonas Rask]], who plays professionally as a [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] with [[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]] in the Finnish [[Liiga]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Cfac89 (5217084890).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Rask in 2008]]\nRask started his career in the youth teams of his hometown club [[SaPKo]] in [[Savonlinna]], Finland. He then played in 28 games for the [[Tampere]]-based [[Ilves|Ilves Jr.]] in the Finnish Junior League. His [[goals against average]] (GAA) was 1.86 with two shutouts and a .935 [[save percentage]]. He was the top ranked European goaltender in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]].\n\nRask played his last European ice hockey season as the number one goaltender for the Ilves senior team in the Finnish top-flight [[Liiga|SM-liiga]].\n\nThe [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] drafted Rask in the first round, 21st overall, in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]]. However, before playing a regular season game for Toronto, he was traded to the [[Boston Bruins]] in exchange for former [[Calder Memorial Trophy]]-winning goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]]. Toronto management had deemed [[Justin Pogge]] their potential goaltender of the future, rendering Rask expendable. It was later revealed the Bruins intended to release Raycroft, which would have made him available to Toronto without having to give up Rask.<ref name=\"Pogge_instead\">{{Cite news |author=Simmons, Steve |date=9 June 2013 |title=Simmons: Bruins would have taken Pogge instead of Rask from Maple Leafs for Raycroft  |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/06/08/simmons-imagine-if-the-bruins-got-pogge-instead-of-rask |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe trade has since been examined as one of the worst trades in Maple Leafs franchise history; Rask would experience many seasons of success with the Bruins, eventually winning the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Vezina Trophy]], while Raycroft would only play two seasons for Toronto, recording disappointing statistics in the process.<ref name=\"trade_worst\">{{Cite news |author=Simmons, Steve |date=19 March 2013 |title=Trading Tuukka Rask could be worst Leafs deal ever  |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/19/trading-tuukka-rask-could-be-worst-leafs-deal-ever |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Boston Bruins===\n[[File:Tuukka Rask 2008.jpg|thumb|Rask with the [[Providence Bruins]] during the [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309]] AHL season.|293x293px]]\nOn 5 May 2007, Rask signed a three-year contract with the Boston Bruins and was in attendance to observe the [[Providence Bruins]]' 2006\u201307 playoff run for the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL)'s [[Calder Cup]] championship.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bostonbruins.com/pressbox/pressreleases.asp?id=2013 | title = P-Bruins capture Calder Cup | publisher = [[Boston Bruins]] | date = 2007-04-28 | accessdate = 2007-04-28 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.boston.com/sports/nesn/bear_tracks/2007/05/bruins_sign_ras.html | work = [[Boston Globe]] | date = 2007-05-01 | accessdate = 2007-05-01 | title = Bruins sign Rask}}</ref> The Providence team did not make it past the second round of the Calder Cup against the [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], but nonetheless Rask practiced with the Providence team.\n\nOn 5 November 2007, Rask was called up to the Boston Bruins for the first time.

On 3 October 2008, the Bruins reassigned Rask to Providence.

Despite this, the team opted to go with the two veteran goaltenders, Thomas and Fernandez, for the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]].\n\nWith nagging back spasms keeping Fernandez from play shortly after the [[2009 National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] break, Rask was once again called up to serve as a second goaltender, and on 31 January 2009, he played his first (and only) game with the Bruins in the [[2008\u201309 Boston Bruins season|2008\u201309 season]], and earned his first ever NHL shutout, a 1\u20130 home effort against the [[New York Rangers]], with [[Marc Savard]] scoring the only Bruins goal.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20082009/GS020731.HTM | title = Bruins blank Rangers behind Rask | publisher = [[National Hockey League]] | date = 2009-01-31 | accessdate = 2009-01-31}}</ref>\n\nNot long after the beginning of the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]], Rask, who had been named the backup goaltender to Thomas, signed a two-year extension to his contract with the Bruins on 5 November that kept him under contract through to the 2011\u201312 season.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://bruins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=504962 | title = Bruins re-sign Rask to two-year deal | publisher = [[Boston Bruins]] | date = 2009-11-05 | accessdate = 2009-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 regular season, Rask was the only goaltender in the NHL with a GAA of less than 2.00 and the only goaltender with a save percentage over .930.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=20102ALLGAGAll&sort=savePercentage&viewName=wlt | title = Goaltending Save Percentage leaders | publisher = [[National Hockey League]] | date = 2013-05-01 | accessdate = 2013-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=20102ALLGAGAll&sort=goalsAgainstAverage&viewName=wlt | title = Goal Against Average leaders | publisher = [[National Hockey League]] | date = 2013-05-01 | accessdate = 2013-05-01}}</ref> Despite having been the only qualifying rookie in NHL history to lead the league with a sub-2.00 GAA, as well as lead the league in save percentage,<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders | title = Single Season Goaltending Leaders | publisher = hockeyreference.com | date = 2013-05-01 | accessdate = 2013-05-01}}</ref> and having supplanted the Vezina Trophy winner Tim Thomas as the starter, Rask was not named as a finalist for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy|rookie of the year award]].

Prior to the declaration of the [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout|2012\u201313 lockout]], Rask was named as the starting goaltender for the Bruins, replacing Tim Thomas, who would eventually be traded to the [[New York Islanders]] on 7 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islanders acquire Goaltender Tim Thomas from Bruins |url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=415479|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=7 February 2013}}</ref> During the lockout, which ended on 6 January 2013, Rask played for [[HC Plze\u0148]], which won the [[Czech Extraliga]] that year.

Rask was drafted 21st overall in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Rask won the [[Vezina Trophy]] as the league's top goaltender during the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]]. In 2011, Rask won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the Bruins. He is the older brother of [[Joonas Rask]], who plays professionally as a [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] with [[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]] in the Finnish [[Liiga]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Cfac89 (5217084890).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Rask in 2008]]\nRask started his career in the youth teams of his hometown club [[SaPKo]] in [[Savonlinna]], Finland. He then played in 28 games for the [[Tampere]]-based [[Ilves|Ilves Jr.]] in the Finnish Junior League. His [[goals against average]] (GAA) was 1.86 with two shutouts and a .935 [[save percentage]]. He was the top ranked European goaltender in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]].\n\nRask played his last European ice hockey season as the number one goaltender for the Ilves senior team in the Finnish top-flight [[Liiga|SM-liiga]].\n\nThe [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] drafted Rask in the first round, 21st overall, in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]].

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi, ZOO Praha 254.jpg|thumb|Jaguarundis are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] carnivores.]]\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=ceballos/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[vertebrate]] prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=fws.gov/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coronado-Quibrera |first1=W.P. |last2=Olmos-Oropeza |first2=G. |last3=Bender |first3=L.C. |last4=Rosas-Rosas |first4=O.C. |last5=Palacio-N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first5=J. |last6=Tarango-Ar\u00e1mbula |first6=L.A. |last7=Herrera-Haro |first7=J.G. |title=Adaptability of the threatened jaguarundi (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'' Schereber, 1777) to human-altered environments in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico |journal=Acta Zool\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2019 |volume=35 |pages=1\u201315 |doi=10.21829/azm.2019.3502210 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/310f/6597fd914eb664e160637b4b1b1d57d87fe7.pdf}}</ref> The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can successfully thrive in reforested areas.<ref name=ceballos/> While commonly inhabiting lowlands up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea level, this cat has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Colombia.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the Andes\u2014second only to the cougar in the [[Latitude|latitudinal]] extent of its distribution.
