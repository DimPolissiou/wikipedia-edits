It comprises two camps, Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell, which both run an eight-week summer camping program. Founded in 1971, Griswold Scout Reservation serves [[Venturing]] crews and [[Scouts BSA]] troops all across [[New England]].<ref name=\"Summer Camp\">[https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/summer-camp/]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Camp Manning ===\nIn 1925, the [[Scouting in New Hampshire|Manchester Council]] purchased {{convert|38|acre}} on the shores of Guinea Pond (now Lake Manning) in Gilmanton Ironworks, opening Camp Manning. It hosted 144 campers in its inaugural season.\u00a0When the Manchester Council was replaced by the Daniel Webster Council in 1929, it was decided to continue to use Camp Manning as the primary camp. In 1932, Camp Manning expanded an additional {{Convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=}}, allowing 305 campers to utilize the camp.<ref>{{Citation|title=Daniel Webster Council|date=2019-12-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Webster_Council&oldid=933106915|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nAs Scouting's numbers continued to increase, it was determined that Camp Manning would no longer be able to accommodate the continuing growth. The Daniel Webster Council moved all summer programs to [[Camp Carpenter]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. In 1945, the decision was made to sell Camp Manning. Four years later, in 1949, Camp Manning was sold to an independent church group, which opened Camp Leo.<ref name=\"Summer Camp\"/>\n\n=== Hidden Valley & Camp Bell ===\nOn the nearby property, the Norumbega Council (based in [[Waban, Massachusetts]], now a part of the [[Scouting in Massachusetts|Knox Trail Council]]) opened Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. The Norumbega Council operated Hidden Valley from 1961 to 1970. After struggles to maintain the property, the Daniel Webster Council purchased Hidden Valley in the fall of 1970. Shortly after, an additional {{Convert|1000|acres|km2|abbr=}} were added to the property. The purchase was made possible through the generosity of Earle A. Griswold, a\u00a0supporter of the Daniel Webster Council. The name of the property remained the same, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. It opened for its first season in 1971. \n\nIn 1988, Camp Leo closed. Despite a long run, Camp Leo mostly flourished in the 1950s-'60s. The Daniel Webster Council purchased the property again in 1990.\u00a0This property was incorporated into the existing camp. Around this same time period, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation became the Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation, in remembrance of Earle A. Griswold.<ref>[http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/valley/index.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Camp Bell, a second camp on the property, was established, utilizing the former land of Camp Leo and Camp Manning. The camp is named for the support of Daniel Webster Council Executive Board Member Ernest \"Tutt\" Bell III. Due to the creation of Camp Bell, Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation's name was simplified to Griswold Scout Reservation. The two camps on the Griswold Scout Reservation are now Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/bell/index.htm|title=Camp Bell Index|website=www.troop19.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Camp Sno-Mo ===\nIn 1989, a unique, \"first-in-the-nation\" partnership was formed between [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals of New Hampshire]] and the [[Daniel Webster Council]]. Griswold Scout Reservation became home to the \"Easter Seals Lodge\", which was built alongside an accompanying campsite in 1991. Together, they compose Camp Sno-Mo (named for their primary donor, the NH Snowmobile Association). Campers with a variety of disabilities begin to mainstream into Scouting and other specialized programming at GSR. Many new programs for Scouts, including the Disabilities Awareness Merit Badge, are offered as part of this new partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/nh/our-programs/camping-recreation/camp-sno-mo.html|title=Camp Sno Mo|website=Easterseals New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|Lakes Region]] of New Hampshire. The property extends through the towns of [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]], [[Gilford, New Hampshire|Gilford]], and [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]] and covers over {{Convert|3500|acre|km2}} of forest, lakes, and mountains.\n\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Belknap Mountains|Belknap Mountain Range]]. Six mountain peaks are located on the property, Mt. Klem, Mt. Anna, Mt. Mack, Mt. Shannon, Lookout Knob, and Goat Pasture Hill. The property includes three lakes, which are [[Sunset Lake (Lakes Region, New Hampshire)|Sunset Lake]], Manning Lake, and Lake Eileen. Both Manning Lake and Sunset Lake are public bodies of water, while Lake Eileen is owned by Griswold Scout Reservation. GSR is surrounded by remote wilderness on most sides, with hiking trails leading to nearby [[Gunstock Mountain]] or [[Belknap Mountain State Forest]]. Several ponds, four swamps, caves, rock faces, and many hills are situated across the reservation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://belknaprangetrails.org/mt-anna/|title=Griswold Scout Reservation {{!}} Belknap Range Trails|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nSeveral points of interest exist across the property, including the site of a 19th century iron mine, a plane wreck from 1973, and a quarry site from the 1800s.\n\nIn 1991, a conservation easement held by the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game Department]] was placed on the entirety of Griswold Scout Reservation. Due to this, public use of the property is authorized year-round. However, certain areas will be restricted during the summer season.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2016, Griswold Scout Reservation and the Daniel Webster Council were awarded the \"2016 Outstanding Community Tree Farmer of the Year\". The Griswold Scout Reservation exemplifies sound forest management and long-term forest stewardship. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtreefarm.org/page.php?cmd=page&id=32&sub=60|title=NH Tree Farm, new hampshire tree farm, NH forest society, new hampshire forest society, forest, society, tree, farm, new hampshire|website=www.nhtreefarm.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Hidden Valley Scout Camp ==\nHidden Valley Scout Camp is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director.  \n\n=== Facilities ===\nHidden Valley features sixteen established campsites of varying sizes. Campsite \"Pioneer\" is reserved for Scouts apart of the Provisional Troop or [[Counselor-in-Training|C.I.T Program.]] Campsites feature canvas walled tents which rest on raised, wooden platforms. Each campsite is equipped with a latrine, with two shower houses spread among the camp. \n\nThe Gilbert Dining Hall, which was built in 1997, serves Scouts three \"family style\" meals a day. It is capable of seating 620 people. Hidden Valley also features a campfire & ceremony amphitheater capable of seating 850 (completed in 2016), and the Carter Lodge Conference center for training or meeting purposes. A 24-hour health lodge, trading post, and chapel are available for Scouts. The majority of these facilities are available for both scout and non-scout groups throughout the calendar year when summer camp is not in session. \n\n=== Programs ===\nHidden Valley is run as a traditional Scout camp with full dining facilities and a wide variety of program areas and activities. Over 60 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] are able to be earned by Scouts, along with various training opportunities for Scouters. Three hour-long merit-badge blocks take place after breakfast, with troops participating in various activities after lunch. After dinner, many program areas open for camp-wide activities, often going into the night. \n\nPrograms include low and high [[ropes course]]s as part of the COPE program, a 12-station archery range, a 16-station rifle/pistol range, an automated trap shooting range, three waterfronts with swimming and boating of all kinds on two different lakes, and any of the various week-long high-adventure treks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/weekend-camping/|title=Weekend Camping and Facility Rental|website=Daniel Webster Council|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n== Camp Bell ==\nCamp Bell is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. \n\n=== Facilities ===\nCamp Bell features seven campsites, which are named after various mountains in New Hampshire. They are nearly identical to those of Hidden Valley. The Camp Bell Main Lodge features a health lodge, trading post, camp office, and [[Commissary (store)|commissary]]. A \"safety pavilion\" was built on the property after numerous Scouts were injured in aligning strike in 2013. Recently, several primitive [[Adirondack lean-to|Adirondack shelters]] were built. The majority of these facilities are available for both scout and non-scout groups throughout the calendar year when summer camp is not in session. \n\n=== Programs ===\nCamp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. Campers do their own cooking in their sites and participate in day-long living-history activities as patrols. Patrols can focus on blacksmithing, logging, snorkeling, water-skiing, or various shooting sports. Camp Bell features an indoor rock climbing barn, an all-terrain vehicle hub with a one-acre, terrain-neutral training site, a 200-seat campfire circle, and a functioning farm.

It comprises two camps, Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell, which both run an eight-week summer camping program. Founded in 1971, Griswold Scout Reservation serves [[Venturing]] crews and [[Scouts BSA]] troops all across [[New England]].<ref name=\"Summer Camp\">[https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/summer-camp/]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Camp Manning ===\nIn 1925, the [[Scouting in New Hampshire|Manchester Council]] purchased {{convert|38|acre}} on the shores of Guinea Pond (now Lake Manning) in Gilmanton Ironworks, opening Camp Manning. It hosted 144 campers in its inaugural season.\u00a0When the Manchester Council was replaced by the Daniel Webster Council in 1929, it was decided to continue to use Camp Manning as the primary camp. In 1932, Camp Manning expanded an additional {{Convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=}}, allowing 305 campers to utilize the camp.<ref>{{Citation|title=Daniel Webster Council|date=2019-12-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Webster_Council&oldid=933106915|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nAs Scouting's numbers continued to increase, it was determined that Camp Manning would no longer be able to accommodate the continuing growth. The Daniel Webster Council moved all summer programs to [[Camp Carpenter]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. In 1945, the decision was made to sell Camp Manning. Four years later, in 1949, Camp Manning was sold to an independent church group, which opened Camp Leo.<ref name=\"Summer Camp\"/>\n\n=== Hidden Valley & Camp Bell ===\nOn the nearby property, the Norumbega Council (based in [[Waban, Massachusetts]], now a part of the [[Scouting in Massachusetts|Knox Trail Council]]) opened Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. The Norumbega Council operated Hidden Valley from 1961 to 1970. After struggles to maintain the property, the Daniel Webster Council purchased Hidden Valley in the fall of 1970. Shortly after, an additional {{Convert|1000|acres|km2|abbr=}} were added to the property. The purchase was made possible through the generosity of Earle A. Griswold, a\u00a0supporter of the Daniel Webster Council. The name of the property remained the same, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. It opened for its first season in 1971. \n\nIn 1988, Camp Leo closed. Despite a long run, Camp Leo mostly flourished in the 1950s-'60s. The Daniel Webster Council purchased the property again in 1990.\u00a0This property was incorporated into the existing camp. Around this same time period, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation became the Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation, in remembrance of Earle A. Griswold.<ref>[http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/valley/index.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Camp Bell, a second camp on the property, was established, utilizing the former land of Camp Leo and Camp Manning. The camp is named for the support of Daniel Webster Council Executive Board Member Ernest \"Tutt\" Bell III. Due to the creation of Camp Bell, Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation's name was simplified to Griswold Scout Reservation. The two camps on the Griswold Scout Reservation are now Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/bell/index.htm|title=Camp Bell Index|website=www.troop19.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Camp Sno-Mo ===\nIn 1989, a unique, \"first-in-the-nation\" partnership was formed between [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals of New Hampshire]] and the [[Daniel Webster Council]]. Griswold Scout Reservation became home to the \"Easter Seals Lodge\", which was built alongside an accompanying campsite in 1991. Together, they compose Camp Sno-Mo (named for their primary donor, the NH Snowmobile Association). Campers with a variety of disabilities begin to mainstream into Scouting and other specialized programming at GSR. Many new programs for Scouts, including the Disabilities Awareness Merit Badge, are offered as part of this new partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/nh/our-programs/camping-recreation/camp-sno-mo.html|title=Camp Sno Mo|website=Easterseals New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|Lakes Region]] of New Hampshire. The property extends through the towns of [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]], [[Gilford, New Hampshire|Gilford]], and [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]] and covers over {{Convert|3500|acre|km2}} of forest, lakes, and mountains.\n\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Belknap Mountains|Belknap Mountain Range]]. Six mountain peaks are located on the property, Mt. Klem, Mt. Anna, Mt. Mack, Mt. Shannon, Lookout Knob, and Goat Pasture Hill. The property includes three lakes, which are [[Sunset Lake (Lakes Region, New Hampshire)|Sunset Lake]], Manning Lake, and Lake Eileen. Both Manning Lake and Sunset Lake are public bodies of water, while Lake Eileen is owned by Griswold Scout Reservation. GSR is surrounded by remote wilderness on most sides, with hiking trails leading to nearby [[Gunstock Mountain]] or [[Belknap Mountain State Forest]]. Several ponds, four swamps, caves, rock faces, and many hills are situated across the reservation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://belknaprangetrails.org/mt-anna/|title=Griswold Scout Reservation {{!}} Belknap Range Trails|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nSeveral points of interest exist across the property, including the site of a 19th century iron mine, a plane wreck from 1973, and a quarry site from the 1800s.\n\nIn 1991, a conservation easement held by the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game Department]] was placed on the entirety of Griswold Scout Reservation. Due to this, public use of the property is authorized year-round. However, certain areas will be restricted during the summer season.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2016, Griswold Scout Reservation and the Daniel Webster Council were awarded the \"2016 Outstanding Community Tree Farmer of the Year\". The Griswold Scout Reservation exemplifies sound forest management and long-term forest stewardship. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtreefarm.org/page.php?cmd=page&id=32&sub=60|title=NH Tree Farm, new hampshire tree farm, NH forest society, new hampshire forest society, forest, society, tree, farm, new hampshire|website=www.nhtreefarm.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Hidden Valley Scout Camp ==\nHidden Valley Scout Camp is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director.  \n\n=== Facilities ===\nHidden Valley features sixteen established campsites of varying sizes. Campsite \"Pioneer\" is reserved for Scouts apart of the Provisional Troop or [[Counselor-in-Training|C.I.T Program.]] Campsites feature canvas walled tents which rest on raised, wooden platforms. Each campsite is equipped with a latrine, with two shower houses spread among the camp. \n\nThe Gilbert Dining Hall, which was built in 1997, serves Scouts three \"family style\" meals a day. It is capable of seating 620 people. Hidden Valley also features a campfire & ceremony amphitheater capable of seating 850 (completed in 2016), and the Carter Lodge Conference center for training or meeting purposes. A 24-hour health lodge, trading post, and chapel are available for Scouts. \n\n=== Programs ===\nHidden Valley is run as a traditional Scout camp with full dining facilities and a wide variety of program areas and activities. Over 60 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] are able to be earned by Scouts, along with various training opportunities for Scouters. Three hour-long merit-badge blocks take place after breakfast, with troops participating in various activities after lunch. After dinner, many program areas open for camp-wide activities, often going into the night. \n\nPrograms include low and high [[ropes course]]s as part of the COPE program, a 12-station archery range, a 16-station rifle/pistol range, an automated trap shooting range, three waterfronts with swimming and boating of all kinds on two different lakes, and any of the various week-long high-adventure treks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/weekend-camping/|title=Weekend Camping and Facility Rental|website=Daniel Webster Council|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n== Camp Bell ==\nCamp Bell is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. \n\n=== Facilities ===\nCamp Bell features seven campsites, which are named after various mountains in New Hampshire. They are nearly identical to those of Hidden Valley. The Camp Bell Main Lodge features a health lodge, trading post, camp office, and [[Commissary (store)|commissary]]. A \"safety pavilion\" was built on the property after numerous Scouts were injured in aligning strike in 2013. Recently, several primitive [[Adirondack lean-to|Adirondack shelters]] were built. \n\n=== Programs ===\nCamp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. Campers do their own cooking in their sites and participate in day-long living-history activities as patrols. Patrols can focus on blacksmithing, logging, snorkeling, water-skiing, or various shooting sports. Camp Bell features an indoor rock climbing barn, an all-terrain vehicle hub with a one-acre, terrain-neutral training site, a 200-seat campfire circle, and a functioning farm. It is ideal for an older-scout bracket.<ref name=\":1\" />  Camp Bell includes various thematic program areas including Challenge Valley (an extreme obstacle course), Mountain Man ([[Muzzleloader|muzzleloaders]] & [[sporting clays]]), Brownsea (outdoor skills area), Logging Camp ([[lumberjack]]), and Foxfire ([[blacksmithing]]).\n\nA week-long [[National Youth Leadership Training]] course takes place at Camp Bell.\n\n== Other history ==\nIn 2013, 23 Scouts were transported to nearby hospitals after a lightning strike at Camp Bell.

They stop in [[Kiev|Kiev, Ukraine]], to visit Chris' brother, Paul ([[Jonathan Sadowski]]), before heading on to [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]], where Chris intends to propose to Natalie.\n\nPaul suggests they go for an \"extreme tour\" of [[Pripyat]], an abandoned town which sits in the shadow of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster]]. Chris is against going on the tour and would rather stay on the original plan of going to Moscow, but Paul insists. They meet tour guide Yuri ([[Dimitri Diatchenko]]) and are joined by a backpacking couple, Norwegian Zoe ([[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]) and Australian Michael ([[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]]). Yuri drives them through Ukraine, before they arrive at a [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] checkpoint, where they are refused entry by the Ukrainian military. He then takes them to an alternate entry he discovered years ago.\n\nThe group stops at a river where Yuri points out a large, mutated fish apparently able to live on land; while returning to their van several other mutant fish are seen. The group is worried about [[radiation poisoning]], but Yuri assures their safety with a [[Geiger counter]]. After spending a few hours exploring, Yuri takes them to the upper floor of an apartment building and shows them the Chernobyl nuclear plant on the near horizon. After hearing noises at the other end of the apartment, it is found to be a bear which runs through the hallway past them, but not harming them.\n\nThe group prepares to leave Pripyat, but Yuri finds the wires in his van have been chewed through. He tries to radio for help, to no avail. As night falls, the group decides on whether to hike to a nearby checkpoint which is 20&nbsp;km (12 miles) away, or to stay put and wait for help. Suddenly, strange noises come from outside, where Yuri goes out to investigate and Chris follows. Shots are heard and Paul runs out, returning with Chris, whose leg has been severely mauled, and claiming that Yuri has been taken. While they decide to stay the night in their locked vehicle, they are attacked by dogs.\n\nThe next day, Paul, Michael, and Amanda go out to look for Yuri. They follow a trail of blood to an abandoned cafeteria and find Yuri's mutilated body. They take his gun and are chased by a creature through the building before returning to the van. Amanda checks her camera and one of the pictures shows a [[humanoid]] creature inside one of the apartment buildings. Natalie stays with the wounded Chris while the others begin the hike to the checkpoint.\n\nDuring the hike, Paul, Amanda, Michael, and Zoe find a parking lot, where they find parts for the Yuri's van. On the way back they are chased by dogs and also attacked by mutant fish in a stream. Night falls as the group returns to the van, only to find it upside down and ripped to shreds. They find Natalie's video camera, showing that she and Chris were attacked and captured by humanoid [[mutant]]s. While searching for the two inside an old building, the group is chased by more mutants.\n\nDuring their escape, a traumatized Natalie is found and rescued, but when the group gets distracted by a mysterious young girl, Natalie is captured again. The rest of the group is swarmed by a horde of mutants and are forced to retreat. While fleeing through an underground passage, Michael is captured. As they continue, they find Chris' engagement ring for Natalie, with no sign of Chris. While climbing a ladder, a gang of mutants drags Zoe back down, forcing Amanda and Paul to leave her behind, emerging from the passage right beside the exposed [[nuclear reactor core]]. Paul recognizes that extremely high radiation levels are [[radiation burn|causing their skin to blister]]. They come upon Natalie's body just before they are confronted by some of their mutant attackers. Fighting them off, the two survivors then encounter Ukrainian military forces outside the reactor building. Blinded by radiation, Paul stumbles toward the soldiers, who kill him.\n\nAmanda falls unconscious and later awakens on a gurney. Several doctors, in protective [[hazmat suit]]s, inform her that she is in a hospital and they will help her. The doctors reveal that the \"creatures\" were escaped patients, and after realizing that Amanda \"knows too much,\" she is then forced into a dark cell and is swarmed by the recaptured patients.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Paul Watson\n* [[Jesse McCartney]] as Chris Watson \n* [[Devin Kelley]] as Amanda Healey  \n* [[Olivia Taylor Dudley]] as Natalie Sullivan  \n* [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] as Zoey \"Zoe\" Anderson \n* [[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]] as Michael Grant  \n* [[Dimitri Diatchenko]] as Yuri \"Uri\" Ovechkin \n* [[Milo\u0161 Timotijevi\u0107]] as Ukrainian Check Point Guard\n* Alex Feldman as Medic Goldshimdt\n* [[Kristof Konrad]] as Medic Grotzky\n* [[Pasha Lychnikoff]] as Doctor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe film, produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], was released in Russia, Canada, Bulgaria and the United States on May 25, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/54751/have-quick-meltdown-after-spending-minute-chernobyl-diaries|title=Have a Quick Meltdown After Spending a Minute with The Chernobyl Diaries |publisher=Dread Central |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref> It went on general release in the [[United Kingdom]] on June 22.\n\n===Home media===\n''Chernobyl Diaries'' was released to DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 16, 2012, in the US.

They stop in [[Kiev|Kiev, Ukraine]], to visit Chris' brother, Paul ([[Jonathan Sadowski]]), before heading on to [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]], where Chris intends to propose to Natalie.\n\nPaul suggests they go for an \"extreme tour\" of [[Pripyat]], an abandoned town which sits in the shadow of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster]]. Chris is against going on the tour and would rather stay on the original plan of going to Moscow, but Paul insists. They meet tour guide Yuri ([[Dimitri Diatchenko]]) and are joined by a backpacking couple, Norwegian Zoe ([[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]) and Australian Michael ([[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]]). Yuri drives them through Ukraine, before they arrive at a [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] checkpoint, where they are refused entry by the Ukrainian military. He then takes them to an alternate entry he discovered years ago.\n\nThe group stops at a river where Yuri points out a large, mutated fish apparently able to live on land; while returning to their van several other mutant fish are seen. The group is worried about [[radiation poisoning]], but Yuri assures their safety with a [[Geiger counter]]. After spending a few hours exploring, Yuri takes them to the upper floor of an apartment building and shows them the Chernobyl nuclear plant on the near horizon. After hearing noises at the other end of the apartment, it is found to be a bear which runs through the hallway past them, but not harming them.\n\nThe group prepares to leave Pripyat, but Yuri finds the wires in his van have been chewed through. He tries to radio for help, to no avail. As night falls, the group decides on whether to hike to a nearby checkpoint which is 20&nbsp;km (12 miles) away, or to stay put and wait for help. Suddenly, strange noises come from outside, where Yuri goes out to investigate and Chris follows. Shots are heard and Paul runs out, returning with Chris, whose leg has been severely mauled, and claiming that Yuri has been taken. While they decide to stay the night in their locked vehicle, they are attacked by dogs.\n\nThe next day, Paul, Michael, and Amanda go out to look for Yuri. They follow a trail of blood to an abandoned cafeteria and find Yuri's mutilated body. They take his gun and are chased by a creature through the building before returning to the van. Amanda checks her camera and one of the pictures shows a [[humanoid]] creature inside one of the apartment buildings. Natalie stays with the wounded Chris while the others begin the hike to the checkpoint.\n\nDuring the hike, Paul, Amanda, Michael, and Zoe find a parking lot, where they find parts for the Yuri's van. On the way back they are chased by dogs and also attacked by mutant fish in a stream. Night falls as the group returns to the van, only to find it upside down and ripped to shreds. They find Natalie's video camera, showing that she and Chris were attacked and captured by humanoid [[mutant]]s. While searching for the two inside an old building, the group is chased by more mutants.\n\nDuring their escape, a traumatized Natalie is found and rescued, but when the group gets distracted by a mysterious young girl, Natalie is captured again. The rest of the group is swarmed by a horde of mutants and are forced to retreat. While fleeing through an underground passage, Michael is captured. As they continue, they find Chris' engagement ring for Natalie, with no sign of Chris. While climbing a ladder, a gang of mutants drags Zoe back down, forcing Amanda and Paul to leave her behind, emerging from the passage right beside the exposed [[nuclear reactor core]]. Paul recognizes that extremely high radiation levels are [[radiation burn|causing their skin to blister]]. They come upon Natalie's body just before they are confronted by some of their mutant attackers. Fighting them off, the two survivors then encounter Ukrainian military forces outside the reactor building. Blinded by radiation, Paul stumbles toward the soldiers, who kill him.\n\nAmanda falls unconscious and later awakens on a gurney. Several doctors, in protective [[hazmat suit]]s, inform her that she is in a hospital and they will help her. The doctors reveal that the \"creatures\" were escaped patients, and after realizing that Amanda \"knows too much,\" she is then forced into a dark cell and is swarmed by the recaptured patients.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Paul Watson\n* [[Jesse McCartney]] as Chris Watson \n* [[Devin Kelley]] as Amanda Healey  \n* [[Olivia Taylor Dudley]] as Natalie Sullivan  \n* [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] as Zoe Andersson \n* [[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]] as Michael Grant  \n* [[Dimitri Diatchenko]] as Yuri Ovechkin \n* [[Milo\u0161 Timotijevi\u0107]] as Ukrainian Check Point Guard\n* Alex Feldman as Medic Goldshimdt\n* [[Kristof Konrad]] as Medic Grotzky\n* [[Pasha Lychnikoff]] as Doctor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe film, produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], was released in Russia, Canada, Bulgaria and the United States on May 25, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/54751/have-quick-meltdown-after-spending-minute-chernobyl-diaries|title=Have a Quick Meltdown After Spending a Minute with The Chernobyl Diaries |publisher=Dread Central |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref> It went on general release in the [[United Kingdom]] on June 22.\n\n===Home media===\n''Chernobyl Diaries'' was released to DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 16, 2012, in the US.

Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater.

All stores in [[Oklahoma]] will be partnered with [[Oklahoma Gas & Electric]] to exclusively use [[wind power]] for all Target stores in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce wastewater by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb stormwater and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in [[Chicago]].\n\nTarget carries over 700 organic and alternative products from brands such as [[Archer Farms]], [[Burt's Bees]], and [[Method Products]].

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.

Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce wastewater by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb stormwater and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds.

Douglas J. Dayton, one of the Dayton brothers, explained John Geisse's concept:\n{{cquote|\"We will offer high-quality merchandise at low margins because we are cutting expenses. We would much rather do this than trumpet dramatic price cuts on cheap merchandise.\"<ref name=growth/>}}\n\nAs a result, Target stores tend to attract younger customers than Walmart, among other competitors. The [[median]] Target shopper is 40, the youngest of all major discount retailers that Target competes directly against. The median household income of Target's customer base is roughly $64,000. Roughly 76% of Target customers are female, and more than 43% have children at home. About 80% have attended college and 57% have completed college.<ref name=community>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |title=Community of Grand Forks |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |publisher=University of North Dakota |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219205819/http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=factcard>{{cite web| url=http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| title=Corporate Fact Card| publisher=Target Corporation| date=October 10, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128161431/http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| archivedate=November 28, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Target announced plans to fight the perception that their products are more expensive than those of other discount retailers. It added perishables to their inventory, cut back on discretionary items, and spent three-quarters of their marketing budget on advertising that emphasizes value and includes actual prices of items featured in ads.

Special attention is given to the design of the store environment: graphics reinforce its advertising imagery, while shelves are dressed with contemporary signage, backdrops, and liners, often printed on inexpensive material such as paper, corrugated and foam boards. Some stores, particularly those in the vicinity of major airports, have a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] painted on the roof that can be seen from above: the stores in [[East Point, Georgia]] near [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]]; [[Rosemont, Illinois]], near [[O'Hare International Airport]]; [[Potomac Yard|Potomac Yard, Virginia]], near [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]; [[College Point, New York]] (Queens), east of [[LaGuardia Airport]]; and [[Richfield, Minnesota]], adjacent to [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport]] are among such locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Target+loc:+Rosemont,+Illinois&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=42.006903,-87.887095&spn=0.00287,0.006748&t=k&om=1 |title= Target on rooftop in Rosemont, IL |publisher=Google Maps |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTarget stores do not sell [[firearm]]s.

Though this practice is often attributed to [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s usage on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|her television show]], it is first attested in 1962, the year the first Target store opened.

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.

For example, some such Target GiftCard designs feature a wooden front side. On May 24, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted U.S. patent D505,450 for the \"ornamental design for credit or stored value card with wood layer\" to inventors Amy L.

Some of the first gift cards issued are valued at over $300 (even though the card doesn't have any money on it). Every year, Target introduces new Holiday GiftCards.

Even if an orbit remains Sun-synchronous, however, other orbital parameters such as [[argument of periapsis]] and the [[orbital eccentricity]] will evolve, due to higher order perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field, the pressure of sunlight, and other causes.  Earth observation satellites, in particular, prefer orbits with constant altitude when passing over the same spot.  Careful selection of eccentricity and location of perigee reveals specific combinations where the perturbations largely cancel and hence the orbit is relatively stable \u2013 a [[frozen orbit]].

The period can be in the range from 88 minutes for a very low orbit ({{mvar|a}} = {{val|6554|u=km}}, {{mvar|i}} = 96\u00b0) to 3.8 hours ({{mvar|a}} = {{val|12352|u=km}}, but this orbit would be equatorial with {{mvar|i}} = 180\u00b0). A period longer than 3.8 hours may be possible by using an eccentric orbit with {{mvar|p}} < {{val|12352|u=km}} but {{mvar|a}} > {{val|12352|u=km}}.\n\nIf one wants a satellite to fly over some given spot on Earth every day at the same hour, it can do between 7 and 16 orbits per day, as shown in the following table. (The table has been calculated assuming the periods given. The orbital period that should be used is actually slightly longer. For instance, a retrograde equatorial orbit that passes over the same spot after 24 hours has a true period about {{sfrac|365|364}} \u2248 1.0027 times longer than the time between overpasses. For non-equatorial orbits the factor is closer to 1.)\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! Orbits <br/>per <br/>day\n! colspan=2 | Period ([[hour|h]])\n!

The Sun will not be in exactly the same position in the sky during the course of the year (see [[Equation of time]] and [[Analemma]]).\n\nSun-synchronous orbits are mostly selected for [[Earth observation satellite]]s, with an altitude typically between 600 and {{val|1000|u=km}} over the Earth surface.  Even if an orbit remains Sun-synchronous, however, other orbital parameters such as [[argument of periapsis]] and the [[orbital eccentricity]] will evolve, due to higher order perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field, the pressure of sunlight, and other causes.  Earth observation satellites, in particular, prefer orbits with constant altitude when passing over the same spot.  Careful selection of eccentricity and location of perigee reveals specific combinations where the perturbations largely cancel and hence the orbit is relatively stable \u2013 a [[frozen orbit]]. The [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]] of [[European Space Agency]], as well as the [[MetOp]] spacecraft of [[EUMETSAT]], are all operated in such Sun-synchronous frozen orbits.<ref>{{cite conference |bibcode=1989ommd.proc...49R |first=Mats |last=Rosengren |title=Improved technique for Passive Eccentricity Control (AAS 89-155) |volume=69 |publisher=AAS/NASA |book-title=Advances in the Astronautical Sciences|year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] \n* [[Analemma]]\n* [[Geosynchronous orbit]]\n* [[Geostationary orbit]]\n* [[List of orbits]]\n* [[Polar orbit]]\n* [[World Geodetic System]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://topex.ucsd.edu/geodynamics/14gravity1_1.pdf Sandwell, David T., The Gravity Field of the Earth - Part 1 (2002)] (p.&nbsp;8)\n* [http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/SUN_SYNCH_ORBIT/DI155.htm Sun-Synchronous Orbit dictionary entry], from U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission\n* [http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970613a.html NASA Q&A]\n* {{cite web|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37901/1/04-0327.pdf|title=The A-B-Cs of Sun Synchronous Orbit Design|publisher=Space Flight Mechanics Conference|first=Ronald J.|last=Boain|date=February 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025153116/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37901/1/04-0327.pdf|archive-date=2007-10-25|df=}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.itc.nl/Pub/sensordb/AllSatellites.aspx List of satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit]\n\n{{orbits}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sun-Synchronous Orbit}}\n[[Category:Earth orbits]]\n", "name_user": "Roborob12345", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added RADARSAT-2 as a satellite in sun sychronous orbit.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit"}
