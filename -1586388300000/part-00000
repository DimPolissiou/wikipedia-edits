(His family in [[Bedfordshire, England]], went by the family name ''Felce''. He called himself George ''Felch'', however, when he moved to America. He began to be known as George ''Felt'' in his later years.)\n\nIn 1630, Felt married 29-year-old Elizabeth Wilkinson, with whom he had six children: Elizabeth, George Jr., Mary, Moses I, Aaron and Moses II. Around 1649, the family moved back to [[Malden, Massachusetts]], just as it was being incorporated into a city. They returned to Casco Bay in 1667, shortly after which Felt bought two thousand more acres of land from Phillips. In 1684, Felt moved back to Massachusetts. He died in Malden, aged about 84, with Elizabeth surviving him by only on year. The couple had become the first citizens of Malden to receive town aid, such was their fall from wealth during the latter stages of their time in Maine.\n\nEnglishman William Royall (b. circa 1595, d. 1676) emigrated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in July 1629, aboard the ''[[Lyon's Whelp]]''. He was a servant in the [[Massachusetts Bay Company|Massachusetts Bay Colony Company]], and after serving his seven years, he was provided with a land grant in the [[Casco Bay]] area of Maine. In 1636, he purchased a farm at what is now the upscale Lambert Point, next to Redding Creek, at the southern tip of Lambert Road, where he lived with his wife, [[County Durham]] native Phoebe Green. They had thirteen children together between 1639 and 1657, the first being son William Jr.\n\nThe Royal River has ever-since borne Royall Sr.'s name, minus the second ''L'', though two streets off Gilman Road \u2014 Royall Meadow Road and Royall Point Road \u2014 carry the original spelling. This stream and its vicinity were called by the Indians \"Westcustogo\" \u2014 a name that, until the early 1990s, was preserved by an inn of the same name on Princes Point Road at its intersection with Lafayette Street.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/me4/westcustogoinn/ Westcustogo Inn]</ref>  (The building remains but it is now occupied by another business.)\n\nRoyall's family moved to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], in 1675, a year before William Sr.'s death. (He was able to see Isaac, son of William Jr. and one of his four grandchildren, born in 1672 before they moved south.) Following in his grandfather's footsteps, some eighty years after the fact, Isaac's brother, Sam Royall, moved to Yarmouth sometime after 1724. He died in the town in 1784. His son, Elijah, followed six years later.\n\nJohn Cousins (b. circa 1596, d. 1682), a native of [[Wiltshire]], England, had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, with his wife, Mary, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has since taken his last name, and owning the island now also so-named. Their son, Isaac,<ref name=banfield>[http://banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com/cousinsdocument2.pdf \"Cousins Make Mark on Maine\"] - banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com</ref> emigrated from Wiltshire in 1647, aged about 34, arriving with his new wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=banfield/>\n\n[[File:Royal River, Yarmouth, Maine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Royal River]] rushing by the mill en route to the First Falls]]\n\nBy 1676, approximately sixty-five people lived in Westcustogo.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die! Take scalp off alive; then take knife and cut neck long 'round.\"<ref>''History of Cumberland County, Maine: Town of Cumberland'', Everts & Peck, 1880</ref> Joseph Felt's daughter and George Felt's great-granddaughter, Sarah, married in 1720 Captain Peter Weare, who recovered the family in some woods near Quebec. He later drowned while crossing the river near his home. The captain's son and Joseph Felt's brother-in-law, Joseph Weare, became a noted scout, pursuing the Native Americans at every opportunity until his death during a trip to Boston sometime after 1774. His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nIn August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39. Hannah remarried, to Jonathan Underwood.\n\nIn June 1748,<ref>[https://archives.mainegenealogy.net/2011/09/north-yarmouth-deaths-1736-1762.html North Yarmouth Necrology, 1736\u20131762)] - Rev.

They killed the elderly Ebenezer Eaton.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nJoseph Burnell was the only inhabitant of the town to be killed at the hands of the Indians in 1751. He had been on horseback near the Presumpscot River falls when he was ambushed and shot. He was found scalped, with his steed lying nearby, having been shot four times.<ref name=rowe1936/> He left behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter, both named Sarah.\n\nIn 1756, Indians attacked the Means family, who lived at Flying Point. The family consisted of Thomas, his wife Alice, daughters Alice and Jane,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/maineulsterscots/posts/1120272948037730 \"Maine Ulster Scots Project\"] - Facebook, May 6, 2016</ref> an infant son, Robert, and Molly Finney, sister of the patriarch and aged about sixteen. The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel. They married shortly afterwards.<ref name=rowe1936/> Alice remarried, to Colonel George Rogers. Thomas is interred in Freeport's First Parish Cemetery, alongside his son. His wife is buried with her second husband in Flying Point Cemetery.\n\nThe Means massacre was the last act of resistance by the indigenous people to occur within the limits of the town.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295. During a time of peace, settlement began to relocate along the coast and inland.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nThe town's Main Street gradually became divided into the Upper Village (also known as the Corner) and Lower Falls, the split roughly located around the present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|U.S. Route 1]] overpass (Brickyard Hollow, as it was known). Among the new proprietors at the time were descendants of the [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].\n\n[[File:Sylvanus Blanchard's house2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wooden plaques provided by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society adorn more than 100 notable buildings in the town.

A 1975 replica now stands just beyond the brick schools on West Main Street.\n\n===Secession from North Yarmouth===\nYarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it [[secession|seceded]] and incorporated as an independent town. The split occurred due to bickering between the inland, farming-based contingent and the coastal maritime-oriented community. Unable to resolve this difference, the two halves of the town separated into present-day Yarmouth and North Yarmouth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nIn 1849 there were nine districts in Yarmouth, designated by numbers: Number One: (Cousins) Island; Number Two: Ledge; Number Three: (Lower) Falls; Number Four: Corner; Number Five: (Princes) Point; Number Six: Greely Road; Number Seven: Pratt; Number Eight: Sweetser; and Number Nine: East (Main). By 1874, however, efforts were made to abolish this setup due its being seen as \"unfair\" in terms of fund distribution.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1850, Yarmouth's population was 2,144, and very little changed over the hundred years that followed.\n\n[[File:Sparhawk Mill 2 2018.jpg|400px|thumb|Looking down the [[Royal River]] from beneath the [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|Route 1]] overpass in Royal River Park]]\n\n18th- and 19th-century business relied heavily upon a variety of natural resources. Once lumber was cut and sent to market, the land was farmed. [[Tanneries]] were built near brooks; potteries and brickyards put to use the natural clay in the area; and mills flourished along the Royal River, providing services such as iron-forging and fulling cloth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouth harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|A circa-1870 view of Yarmouth harbor, taken from where Yankee Marina \u2014 off Lafayette Street \u2014 is now, looking directly north to the East Main Street bridge]]\n\nMaritime activities were important from the beginning of the third settlement. Almost three hundred vessels were launched by Yarmouth's shipyards in the century between 1790 and 1890.<ref name=\"Hall\">''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002)</ref> Lumber from inland areas was shipped out from the harbor. Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes. (Walker lived in the brick building at 51 Pleasant Street.)<ref name=Aldredge/> On the eastern side of the river, Giles Loring had a shipyard. It was here that the final large sailing vessel was built, in 1890.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> Today, there are just two boatyards, one on either side of Lower Falls Landing: Yarmouth Boatyard (formerly Union Wharf; established in 1948; located almost beneath the northbound lanes of Interstate 295) and Yankee Marina (established in 1964; whose entrance is near the crest of the Route 88 hill).\n\n===19th century Yarmouth===\nIn 1887, a fire started in the dry grass south of Grand Trunk Station by a spark from a passing train. Fanned by a strong wind, it spread rapidly into the woods and up over the ledge. Two hundred acres were burned, and the fire was only stopped because it reached the waters of Broad Cove.<ref name=rowe1936>''Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History'', William Hutchison Rowe (1937)</ref>\n\nYarmouth's \"town system\"<ref name=rowe1936/> went into effect in April 1889. Three of the former districts were discontinued because they were small and had dilapidated buildings. These were Princes Point, Greely Road and the Sweetser district \u2013 the last of which was on the Sodom Road (now Granite Street) and the Freeport line.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nElectricity came to Yarmouth in 1893.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\n[[File:Yarmouth_Maine_harbour.jpeg|thumb|300px|A similar view in 2019]]\n\nAnother, more menacing fire occurred in April 1900, when the corn-canning factory of Asa York caught from a spark blown from the stack of the Walker & Cleaves sawmill. A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1903, the post office established a route around town for the rural free delivery of mail. Hired was Joshua Adams Drinkwater as the town's first [[letter carrier]]. Early in the morning he would leave Princes Point, pick up the mail at Lower Falls, and then deliver letters to the northern edge of town, including Sligo and Mountfort Roads. Around noon, he would pick up the afternoon sack for the town's western and coastal farms. Each day, as he passed his farm on Princes Point Road, he would change horses and eat lunch with his wife, Harriet.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

(His family in [[Bedfordshire, England]], went by the family name ''Felce''. He called himself George ''Felch'', however, when he moved to America. He began to be known as George ''Felt'' in his later years.)\n\nIn 1630, Felt married 29-year-old Elizabeth Wilkinson, with whom he had six children: Elizabeth, George Jr., Mary, Moses I, Aaron and Moses II. Around 1649, the family moved back to [[Malden, Massachusetts]], just as it was being incorporated into a city. They returned to Casco Bay in 1667, shortly after which Felt bought two thousand more acres of land from Phillips. In 1684, Felt moved back to Massachusetts. He died in Malden, aged about 84, with Elizabeth surviving him by only on year. The couple had become the first citizens of Malden to receive town aid, such was their fall from wealth during the latter stages of their time in Maine.\n\nEnglishman William Royall (b. circa 1595, d. 1676) emigrated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in July 1629, aboard the ''[[Lyon's Whelp]]''. He was a servant in the [[Massachusetts Bay Company|Massachusetts Bay Colony Company]], and after serving his seven years, he was provided with a land grant in the [[Casco Bay]] area of Maine. In 1636, he purchased a farm at what is now the upscale Lambert Point, next to Redding Creek, at the southern tip of Lambert Road, where he lived with his wife, [[County Durham]] native Phoebe Green. They had thirteen children together between 1639 and 1657, the first being son William Jr.\n\nThe Royal River has ever-since borne Royall Sr.'s name, minus the second ''L'', though two streets off Gilman Road \u2014 Royall Meadow Road and Royall Point Road \u2014 carry the original spelling. This stream and its vicinity were called by the Indians \"Westcustogo\" \u2014 a name that, until the early 1990s, was preserved by an inn of the same name on Princes Point Road at its intersection with Lafayette Street.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/me4/westcustogoinn/ Westcustogo Inn]</ref>  (The building remains but it is now occupied by another business.)\n\nRoyall's family moved to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], in 1675, a year before William Sr.'s death. (He was able to see Isaac, son of William Jr. and one of his four grandchildren, born in 1672 before they moved south.) Following in his grandfather's footsteps, some eighty years after the fact, Isaac's brother, Sam Royall, moved to Yarmouth sometime after 1724. He died in the town in 1784. His son, Elijah, followed six years later.\n\nJohn Cousins (b. circa 1596, d. 1682), a native of [[Wiltshire]], England, had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, with his wife, Mary, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has since taken his last name, and owning the island now also so-named. Their son, Isaac,<ref name=banfield>[http://banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com/cousinsdocument2.pdf \"Cousins Make Mark on Maine\"] - banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com</ref> emigrated from Wiltshire in 1647, aged about 34, arriving with his new wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=banfield/>\n\n[[File:Royal River, Yarmouth, Maine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Royal River]] rushing by the mill en route to the First Falls]]\n\nBy 1676, approximately sixty-five people lived in Westcustogo.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die! Take scalp off alive; then take knife and cut neck long 'round.\"<ref>''History of Cumberland County, Maine: Town of Cumberland'', Everts & Peck, 1880</ref> Joseph Felt's daughter and George Felt's great-granddaughter, Sarah, married in 1720 Captain Peter Weare, who recovered the family in some woods near Quebec. He later drowned while crossing the river near his home. The captain's son and Joseph Felt's brother-in-law, Joseph Weare, became a noted scout, pursuing the Native Americans at every opportunity until his death during a trip to Boston sometime after 1774. His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nIn August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39. Hannah remarried, to Jonathan Underwood.\n\nIn June 1748,<ref>[https://archives.mainegenealogy.net/2011/09/north-yarmouth-deaths-1736-1762.html North Yarmouth Necrology, 1736\u20131762)] - Rev.

He had been on horseback near the Presumpscot River falls when he was ambushed and shot. He was found scalped, with his steed lying nearby, having been shot four times.<ref name=rowe1936/> He left behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter, both named Sarah.\n\nIn 1756, Indians attacked the Means family, who lived at Flying Point. The family consisted of Thomas, his wife Alice, daughters Alice and Jane,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/maineulsterscots/posts/1120272948037730 \"Maine Ulster Scots Project\"] - Facebook, May 6, 2016</ref> an infant son, Robert, and Molly Finney, sister of the patriarch and aged about sixteen. The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel. They married shortly afterwards.<ref name=rowe1936/> Alice remarried, to Colonel George Rogers. Thomas is interred in Freeport's First Parish Cemetery, alongside his son. His wife is buried with her second husband in Flying Point Cemetery.\n\nThe Means massacre was the last act of resistance by the indigenous people to occur within the limits of the town.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295.

A 1975 replica now stands just beyond the brick schools on West Main Street.\n\n===Secession from North Yarmouth===\nYarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it [[secession|seceded]] and incorporated as an independent town. The split occurred due to bickering between the inland, farming-based contingent and the coastal maritime-oriented community. Unable to resolve this difference, the two halves of the town separated into present-day Yarmouth and North Yarmouth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nIn 1849 there were nine districts in Yarmouth, designated by numbers: Number One: (Cousins) Island; Number Two: Ledge; Number Three: (Lower) Falls; Number Four: Corner; Number Five: (Princes) Point; Number Six: Greely Road; Number Seven: Pratt; Number Eight: Sweetser; and Number Nine: East (Main). By 1874, however, efforts were made to abolish this setup due its being seen as \"unfair\" in terms of fund distribution.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1850, Yarmouth's population was 2,144, and very little changed over the hundred years that followed.\n\n[[File:Sparhawk Mill 2 2018.jpg|400px|thumb|Looking down the [[Royal River]] from beneath the [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|Route 1]] overpass in Royal River Park]]\n\n18th- and 19th-century business relied heavily upon a variety of natural resources. Once lumber was cut and sent to market, the land was farmed. [[Tanneries]] were built near brooks; potteries and brickyards put to use the natural clay in the area; and mills flourished along the Royal River, providing services such as iron-forging and fulling cloth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouth harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|A circa-1870 view of Yarmouth harbor, taken from where Yankee Marina \u2014 off Lafayette Street \u2014 is now, looking directly north to the East Main Street bridge]]\n\nMaritime activities were important from the beginning of the third settlement. Almost three hundred vessels were launched by Yarmouth's shipyards in the century between 1790 and 1890.<ref name=\"Hall\">''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002)</ref> Lumber from inland areas was shipped out from the harbor. Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes. (Walker lived in the brick building at 51 Pleasant Street.)<ref name=Aldredge/> On the eastern side of the river, Giles Loring had a shipyard. It was here that the final large sailing vessel was built, in 1890.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> Today, there are just two boatyards, one on either side of Lower Falls Landing: Yarmouth Boatyard (formerly Union Wharf; established in 1948; located almost beneath the northbound lanes of Interstate 295) and Yankee Marina (established in 1964; whose entrance is near the crest of the Route 88 hill).\n\n===19th century Yarmouth===\nIn 1887, a fire started in the dry grass south of Grand Trunk Station by a spark from a passing train. Fanned by a strong wind, it spread rapidly into the woods and up over the ledge. Two hundred acres were burned, and the fire was only stopped because it reached the waters of Broad Cove.<ref name=rowe1936>''Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History'', William Hutchison Rowe (1937)</ref>\n\nYarmouth's \"town system\"<ref name=rowe1936/> went into effect in April 1889. Three of the former districts were discontinued because they were small and had dilapidated buildings. These were Princes Point, Greely Road and the Sweetser district \u2013 the last of which was on the Sodom Road (now Granite Street) and the Freeport line.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nElectricity came to Yarmouth in 1893.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\n[[File:Yarmouth_Maine_harbour.jpeg|thumb|300px|A similar view in 2019]]\n\nAnother, more menacing fire occurred in April 1900, when the corn-canning factory of Asa York caught from a spark blown from the stack of the Walker & Cleaves sawmill. A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1903, the post office established a route around town for the rural free delivery of mail. Hired was Joshua Adams Drinkwater as the town's first [[letter carrier]]. Early in the morning he would leave Princes Point, pick up the mail at Lower Falls, and then deliver letters to the northern edge of town, including Sligo and Mountfort Roads. Around noon, he would pick up the afternoon sack for the town's western and coastal farms. Each day, as he passed his farm on Princes Point Road, he would change horses and eat lunch with his wife, Harriet.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.11</ref> They had a daughter, Elizabeth.\n\nIn 1918, the [[Spanish flu]] hit town in two waves, resulting in 370 cases and 14 deaths.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nIn 1923, town historian William H. Rowe announced that a history of Yarmouth was in the works. The project took thirteen more years to complete, but it was \"so thorough that it is still in print\".<ref name=Hall/> Rowe died in 1955, aged about 73.\n\nIn 1949, Yarmouth celebrated its centenary with a parade.<ref name=p23>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.23</ref>\n\nRapid growth was experienced again around 1948 when Route 1 was put through the town. Two years later, there were 2,699 inhabitants of the town. [[Interstate 295 (Maine)|Interstate 295]] was built through the harbor in 1961 (spanning part of the harbor known as Grantville<ref>[http://obituaries.pressherald.com/obituaries/mainetoday-pressherald/obituary.aspx?n=edna-may-morrill&pid=93080180 \"Edna May Morrill Obituary\"] - Legacy.com, August 22, 2007</ref> across to the land between Route 88 and Old Shipyard Road), and the town grew about 40%, from 4,854 residents in 1970 to 8,300 thirty-five years later.\n\n===New millennium===\nAs of the early 20th century, Yarmouth is mostly residential in character, with commercial development scattered throughout the town, particularly along Route 1 and Main Street ([[Maine State Route 115|State Route 115]]).\n\n[[Category:Yarmouth, Maine]]\n[[Category:History of towns in Maine]]\n", "name_user": "Seasider53", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Yarmouth,_Maine"}

After working for various newspapers in New York and [[Boston]], he served in various roles during the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He was appointed as Governor of Alaska in 1939 and became a prominent advocate of Alaska statehood.\n\nGruening became one of Alaska's inaugural pair of Senators after Alaska gained statehood in 1959. Gruening was a prominent opponent of the [[Vietnam War]], and with Oregon's [[Wayne Morse]], was one of just two Senators to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] which allowed the bombing of North Vietnam. In 1968, [[Mike Gravel]] defeated Gruening in the Senate Democratic primary, and Gruening's attempt to win re-election as an [[independent politician|independent]] was unsuccessful.\n\n==Early life==\nGruening was born in New York City, the son of Phebe (Fridenberg) and Emil Gruening, an eye and ear surgeon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gruening-ernest</ref> Gruening attended [[Hotchkiss School|The Hotchkiss School]], and he graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1907 and from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1912 at the age of 25. He then forsook medicine to pursue journalism, finding it more exciting. Initially a reporter for the ''[[Boston American]]'' in 1912, he went on to become copy desk editor and rewrite man for the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Evening Herald]]'' and, from 1912 to 1913, an editorial writer. He also worked for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Boston Journal|Boston Journal]]'' at various points. For four years, Gruening was, consecutively, managing editor of the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. After serving in [[World War I]], Gruening became the editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1920 to 1923 and the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' for four months in 1934. During his time in New York, he also worked for the Spanish-language publication ''La Prensa''.\n\n==Political career==\nIntrigued with [[New Deal]] politics, he switched careers. Gruening was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th [[Pan-American Conference|Inter-American Conference]] in 1933, Director of the [[Division of Territories and Island Possessions]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], 1934\u20131939, and Administrator of the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]], 1935\u20131937. He was a member of the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska International Highway Commission]] from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, Gruening was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska, and served in that position for 13 1/2 years. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s of [[1952 Democratic National Convention|1952]], [[1956 Democratic National Convention|1956]], and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]], and was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1958, serving for 10 years.\n\nOne of Gruening's areas of expertise was [[Mexico]]. In 1928, he published the most comprehensive book on the country, which is still recommended by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and Mexican officials today. For this work, the best written by a non-Mexican on Mexico, he received the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]] from the Mexican government.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite having been born outside of Alaska, he was a fervent supporter of the territory's statehood, serving as one of its first Senators after statehood. He gave the keynote speech in 1955 at the Alaskan Constitutional Convention entitled \"Let Us End American [[Colonialism]]!\" in which he outlined the ways in which the United States mirrored the actions of the [[British Empire]] in North America before the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in relation to the territory of Alaska. Gruening's argument was that Alaska had been a colony of the U.S., but one that, from its purchase, had been promised statehood.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Let us end American colonialism|url = http://library.alaska.gov/hist/fulltext/ASL-J87.A417G89.htm|website = library.alaska.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref> With his assistance and support, Alaska entered the union four years later, in 1959.\n\n== Governorship ==\nErnest Gruening served as the 7th governor of the Alaskan territory from 1939 to 1953. During his term, he continued to write letters to the editor at ''[[The New Republic]]''. One such letter<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gruening|first1=Ernest|title=Alaska Provides for Veterans|issue=115(20)|work=New Republic|date=1946}}</ref> examined that publication's recent discussion of state legislation affecting [[veteran]]s. Gruening's letter included information on the steps taken by his territorial government benefiting veterans in the state. His plan, the [[Territorial Veterans' Act]], provided for loans up to $10,000 for veterans at a four percent [[interest rate]], half the established rate in Alaska of eight percent.\n\nA significant issue during Gruening's tenure as territorial governor, particularly in 1946, was a [[tuberculosis]] rate so high it caused him to declare a [[state of emergency]]. The territory had as many as 4000 patients and only 289 hospital beds. Alaska spent one-tenth of its annual budget increasing awareness about TB, yet the death rate was still eight times the United States average.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Scourge of the North|last = |first = |date = 1946|work = Time|volume=47|issue=19|page=54|access-date = |via = }}</ref>\n\nAnother concern during Gruening's time as governor was the possible effect on [[wildlife]] caused by large numbers of soldiers arriving prior to the United States entry into [[World War II]], and which would only increase during the conflict. While he fully supported military presence and activities, after so many soldiers had been in the state long enough to gain resident hunting licenses (significantly cheaper than nonresident licenses) Gruening worried wildlife populations would suffer. Because of this, he began to focus on instituting new regulations to protect Alaska's animals and environment from the [[Overexploitation|over-harvesting]] that he saw as inevitable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===World War II===\nIn the spring of 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Meanwhile, in September of that year, [[Imperial Japan]] [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded and conquered French Indochina]] while simultaneously fighting [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. There had been growing concern in Alaska over the lack of military defense, as it was vulnerable to [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion. Gruening had been pushing for defense facilities in Alaska since his appointment to the governorship, and because of recent actions from Germany and Japan, [[United States Congress|Congress]] designated funds to build army forts and airfields in the territory.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1941, there were 3,000 [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] soldiers stationed around Alaska.<ref name=\":0\" /> With the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Gruening prepared for Alaska to be next.

Ickes|Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes]] developed a plan to resettle refugees fleeing the [[Continental Europe|European continent]] in sparsely-populated Alaska. Many of Alaska's infrastructure difficulties were caused by low population, both in overall numbers and density. An influx of immigrants would help solve some of the problems, but Gruening, Alaskans, and 64.7% of Americans, a ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' survey in 1938 showed, opposed accepting more immigrants and moving them to Alaska. While this suggestion was gaining force in 1938, before Gruening became the territorial governor, it continued throughout World War II.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== U.S. Senate ==\nGruening served Alaska in the [[United States Senate]] from 1959 to 1969. He was defeated for re-election in 1968 by fellow Democrat [[Mike Gravel]]. When Gravel won the Democratic [[primary election|primary]], Gruening ran in the general election as an [[Independent politician|independent]], taking third place, behind Gravel and Republican former [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] Mayor [[Elmer E. Rasmuson]]. He continued his active political involvement as president of an [[investment firm]] and as a legislative consultant. He died on June 26, 1974.\n\nGruening's most notable act as an officeholder was being one of only two Senators, along with [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]], to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] which passed on August 7, 1964. It authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He was also responsible for introducing a set of Congressional resolutions to establish the nationwide [[9-1-1|911]] number.\n\nIn 2006, Norman Jacques, former [[Rhode Island Senate|state senator]] from [[Rhode Island]], called the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' saying he was putting Gruening's Senate seat up for auction\u2014the actual chair used by the Alaskan senator on the U.S. Senate floor.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Chair with a story - Ernest Gruening's Senate 'seat' is going up for auction|last = McKinney|first = Debra|date = April 27, 2006|work = Anchorage Daily News|access-date = |via = }}</ref> When Gruening left, he was given the option to buy his seat, and he did.

In this article, Gruening notes that his 30-page speech, including exhibits, on March 10, 1964 was the first piece of opposition out of [[United States Congress|Congress]] regarding the Vietnam War. He was against the bloodshed, against the expense, against the number of refugees resulting from combat, and against how it had changed the worldview on the morality of the United States. He focused on combatting the mindset that since the U.S. was involved in Vietnam it might as well stay; Gruening suggested that the U.S. entrance into the Southeast Asian theatre was misguided, and called for an apology.\n\nIn an article about his debate with [[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]] [[William P. Bundy]] regarding Vietnam, Gruening continued this fight against U.S. involvement in the region and its consequences, stating \"After you have been bombing villagers with [[napalm]], it's going to be very difficult to persuade people that you are their friend.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Bundy-Gruening Debate|last = Kempton|first = M.|date = 1965|work = The New Republic|access-date = |via = |issue = 152(19)|pages = 9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nWhile Gruening was not an Alaska resident when he was appointed governor, he lived in Alaska after leaving office.  Remaining in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], he spent most of his later years living with his wife [[Dorothy Smith Gruening|Dorothy]] in a cabin at [[Out the road|Mile 26]] of the [[Alaska Route 7|Glacier Highway]].  The cabin is currently [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska|listed on the National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThough only one of his three sons reached adulthood, Gruening's descendants have managed to establish roots in Alaska after him, mostly in Juneau.  [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 1980|In 1980]], Gruening's grandson, [[Clark Gruening]] (who grew up in Juneau but moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] following college, serving from there for two terms in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]]), defeated incumbent Gravel for the Democratic nomination in the U.S. Senate primary.\n\nAnother grandson, Winthrop H. \"Win\" Gruening, was the longtime head of The Alaska Committee, organized in Juneau in 1995 to lobby for keeping [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] as Alaska's capital.<ref>{{cite news|title=Juneau Color \u2013 Piloting, permanent fund and paragliders|first=Bill|last=McAllister|url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/090800/Loc_PPFDP.html|newspaper=[[Juneau Empire]]|date=September 8, 2000|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  Win Gruening also had a long career in banking in Juneau, originally with B. M. Behrends Bank, which called itself the oldest bank in Alaska prior to being absorbed by [[KeyBank]], and with KeyBank following the acquisition.  His daughter, Caroline Gruening, enjoyed success in basketball, playing guard for [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] and [[Santa Clara University]].\n\n== Tributes ==\n[[File:Grueningstreet.jpg|right|thumb|Gruening Street in [[Homer, Alaska|Homer]], one of several communities throughout Alaska which has a street named for Gruening.]]\nThe Ernest Gruening Building, a classroom building on the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus, is named in his honor.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Gruening was the [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory]] from 1939 until 1953, and a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Alaska from 1959 until 1969.\n\nBorn in New York City, Gruening pursued a career in journalism after graduating from [[Harvard Medical School]]. After working for various newspapers in New York and [[Boston]], he served in various roles during the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He was appointed as Governor of Alaska in 1939 and became a prominent advocate of Alaska statehood.\n\nGruening became one of Alaska's inaugural pair of Senators after Alaska gained statehood in 1959. Gruening was a prominent opponent of the [[Vietnam War]], and with Oregon's [[Wayne Morse]], was one of just two Senators to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] which allowed the bombing of North Vietnam. In 1968, [[Mike Gravel]] defeated Gruening in the Senate Democratic primary, and Gruening's attempt to win re-election as an [[independent politician|independent]] was unsuccessful.\n\n==Early life==\nGruening was born in New York City, the son of Phebe (Fridenberg) and Emil Gruening, an eye and ear surgeon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gruening-ernest</ref> Gruening attended [[Hotchkiss School|The Hotchkiss School]], and he graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1907 and from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1912 at the age of 25. He then forsook medicine to pursue journalism, finding it more exciting. Initially a reporter for the ''[[Boston American]]'' in 1912, he went on to become copy desk editor and rewrite man for the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Evening Herald]]'' and, from 1912 to 1913, an editorial writer. He also worked for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Boston Journal|Boston Journal]]'' at various points. For four years, Gruening was, consecutively, managing editor of the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. After serving in [[World War I]], Gruening became the editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1920 to 1923 and the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' for four months in 1934. During his time in New York, he also worked for the Spanish-language publication ''La Prensa''.\n\n==Political career==\nIntrigued with [[New Deal]] politics, he switched careers. Gruening was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th [[Pan-American Conference|Inter-American Conference]] in 1933, Director of the [[Division of Territories and Island Possessions]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], 1934\u20131939, and Administrator of the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]], 1935\u20131937. He was a member of the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska International Highway Commission]] from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, Gruening was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska, and served in that position for 13 1/2 years. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s of [[1952 Democratic National Convention|1952]], [[1956 Democratic National Convention|1956]], and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]], and was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1958, serving for 10 years.\n\nOne of Gruening's areas of expertise was [[Mexico]].

In this article, Gruening notes that his 30-page speech, including exhibits, on March 10, 1964 was the first piece of opposition out of [[United States Congress|Congress]] regarding the Vietnam War. He was against the bloodshed, against the expense, against the number of refugees resulting from combat, and against how it had changed the worldview on the morality of the United States. He focused on combatting the mindset that since the U.S. was involved in Vietnam it might as well stay; Gruening suggested that the U.S. entrance into the Southeast Asian theatre was misguided, and called for an apology.\n\nIn an article about his debate with [[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]] [[William P. Bundy]] regarding Vietnam, Gruening continued this fight against U.S. involvement in the region and its consequences, stating \"After you have been bombing villagers with [[napalm]], it's going to be very difficult to persuade people that you are their friend.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Bundy-Gruening Debate|last = Kempton|first = M.|date = 1965|work = The New Republic|access-date = |via = |issue = 152(19)|pages = 9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nWhile Gruening was not an Alaska resident when he was appointed governor, he lived in Alaska after leaving office.

The cabin is currently [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska|listed on the National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThough only one of his three sons reached adulthood, Gruening's descendants have managed to establish roots in Alaska after him, mostly in Juneau.

Rugby was originally a small [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] farming settlement on the hill overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] and was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Rocheberie'', a popular theory is that this was a phonetic translation of the [[Old English]] name ''Hrocaberg'' meaning 'Hroca's hill fortification'; ''Hroca'' being an Anglo-Saxon man's name pronounced with a silent 'H', and ''berg'' being a name for a hill fortification, with the 'g' being pronounced as an 'ee' sound. By the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as ''Rokeby'' before gradually evolving into the modern form.<ref name=\"RGOAT\">{{cite book |last1=Osbourne, Andy |first1=Rawlins, Eddy |title=Rugby Growth Of A Town |date=1988}}</ref> In 1140 the first mention was made of [[St Andrew's Church, Rugby|St Andrew's Church]] which was originally a chapel of the mother church at [[Clifton-upon-Dunsmore]], until Rugby was established as a [[parish]] in its own right in 1221. Rugby obtained a charter to hold a [[Marketplace|market]] in 1255, and soon developed into a small country [[market town]].<ref name=\"Rughistim\">{{cite web|title=Rugby history timeline|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|publisher=Rugby Local History Research Group|accessdate=30 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920204515/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Rugby School]] was founded in 1567 with money left in the will of [[Lawrence Sheriff]], a locally born man, who moved to London and became grocer to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Rugby School was originally intended as a school for local boys, but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school, with most of its pupils coming from outside Rugby. The [[Lawrence Sheriff School]] was eventually founded in 1878 to carry on Sheriff's original intentions.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHERIFF, Lawrence|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|publisher=Rugby Local History Group|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412001354/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] passed through Rugby in 1642 on his way to [[Nottingham]], and 120 [[Cavalier]] Horse Troops reportedly stayed at the town, however the townsfolk were sympathetic to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause, and they were disarmed by the Cavalier soldiers. Later, in 1645, Rugby was strongly Parliamentarian, and [[Oliver Cromwell]] and two regiments of [[Roundhead]] soldiers stayed at Rugby in April that year, two months before the [[Battle of Naseby]] in nearby [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"RGOAT\"/><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> \n\nThe growth of Rugby was slow, due in part to the nearby markets at [[Dunchurch]] and [[Hillmorton]] which were better positioned in terms of road traffic. In 1663 Rugby was recorded as containing 160 houses with a population of around 650. By 1730 this had increased to 183 houses, with a population of around 900. Rugby's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of Rugby School, which had moved from its original location at a (now long vanished) schoolhouse north of St Andrew's Church, to its present location south of the town centre by 1750. By the time of the first national census in 1801, Rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses. By 1831 this had increased further to 2,501 in 415 houses. This growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to Rugby School, but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in Rugby.<ref name=\"RFASPAST\">''Rugby, Further Aspects Of The Past'' (1977) Rugby Local History Group</ref><ref name=\"BHOL\"/><ref name=\"RGOAT\"/>\n[[File:45 of '(Our own country.

Rugby was originally a small [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] farming settlement on the hill overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] and was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Rocheberie'', a popular theory is that this was a phonetic translation of the [[Old English]] name ''Hrocaberg'' meaning 'Hroca's hill fortification'; ''Hroca'' being an Anglo-Saxon man's name pronounced with a silent 'H', and ''berg'' being a name for a hill fortification, with the 'g' being pronounced as an 'ee' sound. By the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as ''Rokeby'' before gradually evolving into the modern form.<ref name=\"RGOAT\">{{cite book |last1=Osbourne, Andy |first1=Rawlins, Eddy |title=Rugby Growth Of A Town |date=1988}}</ref> In 1140 the first mention was made of [[St Andrew's Church, Rugby|St Andrew's Church]] which was originally a chapel of the mother church at [[Clifton-upon-Dunsmore]], until Rugby was established as a [[parish]] in its own right in 1221.

Rugby School was originally intended as a school for local boys, but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school, with most of its pupils coming from outside Rugby. The [[Lawrence Sheriff School]] was eventually founded in 1878 to carry on Sheriff's original intentions.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHERIFF, Lawrence|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|publisher=Rugby Local History Group|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412001354/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] passed through Rugby in 1642 on his way to [[Nottingham]], and 120 [[Cavalier]] Horse Troops reportedly stayed at the town, however the townsfolk were sympathetic to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause, and they were disarmed by the Cavalier soldiers. Later, in 1645, Rugby was strongly Parliamentarian, and [[Oliver Cromwell]] and two regiments of [[Roundhead]] soldiers stayed at Rugby in April that year, two months before the [[Battle of Naseby]] in nearby [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"RGOAT\"/><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> \n\nThe growth of Rugby was slow, due in part to the nearby markets at [[Dunchurch]] and [[Hillmorton]] which were better positioned in terms of road traffic. In 1663 Rugby was recorded as containing 160 houses with a population of around 650. By 1730 this had increased to 183 houses, with a population of around 900. Rugby's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of Rugby School, which had moved from its original location at a (now long vanished) schoolhouse north of St Andrew's Church, to its present location south of the town centre by 1750. By the time of the first national census in 1801, Rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses. By 1831 this had increased further to 2,501 in 415 houses. This growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to Rugby School, but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in Rugby.<ref name=\"RFASPAST\">''Rugby, Further Aspects Of The Past'' (1977) Rugby Local History Group</ref><ref name=\"BHOL\"/><ref name=\"RGOAT\"/>\n[[File:45 of '(Our own country.

Try as he might, Mike no longer can get a new Hollywood project made.\n\nAccustomed to a lavish lifestyle, Mike has pampered his daughter, January, providing her with an expensive education in Europe and everything else money can buy. January worships her father and eagerly returns to America to be with him again.\n\nNeeding capital, Mike enters into a loveless marriage with Deidre Milford Granger, one of the world's wealthiest women. She has already been through multiple marriages and demands that things be done her way. She also is secretly carrying on a lesbian affair. January is devastated to learn that Mike is now wed to this rude, arrogant woman.\n\nDeidre attempts to draw January into a relationship with her cousin David Milford, a ladies' man who also usually gets his own way. He finally persuades January into going to bed with him, only to discover that she is a virgin.\n\nUnsure what to do with her life, January is advised by an old friend, Linda Riggs, now a magazine editor, to author a book. Linda enjoys a free-spirit life with many lovers and urges January to do likewise. But due in no small part to her [[father complex]], January instead falls for a much-older Tom Colt, a hard-drinking, impotent novelist who is an adversary of her father's.\n\nMike bitterly resents the affair. He punches Colt upon catching January in a Beverly Hills hotel bungalow with him. Mike orders his daughter to make a choice between them, and Colt gives her the same ultimatum. She chooses her lover.\n\nDeidre's demands and insults finally become too much for Mike, who wants a divorce. They amicably agree to one, but their airplane crashes and both are killed.

The nationalists have combined this campaign with the [[Battle of Siping]] as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the [[Battle of Siping]].  More importantly, the nationalists in the [[Battle of Siping]] was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly [[Warlord era|warlords]] ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after [[World War II]], and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region.  In fact, in the [[Battle of Siping]], Chiang's own force did not even participated in the fights.  This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the defeat of [[Jinjiatun Campaign]], the nationalists resumed their offensive with vengeance.  In a short period of just two days, the nationalists were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping.  [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was determined to take [[Changchun]] after taking Siping, and [[Mao Zedong]] was equally determined to hold Siping  to the end and prevent the nationalists from taking both Siping and Changchun.  Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge:  [[Du Yuming]] for the nationalists and [[Lin Biao]] for the communists.\n\n==Order of battle==\nAttackers: nationalist [[order of battle]]:\n*[[New 1st Army]]\n*[[New 6th Army]]\n*71st Army\n*93rd Army\n*Army-sized 207th Division of the Youth Army\nDefenders: communist [[order of battle]]:\n* Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column\n*Southern Manchurian 3rd Column\n*Western Manchurian 3rd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*Northern Manchurian 7th Division\n*[[Shandong]] 1st Division\n*[[Shandong]] 2nd Division\n*[[Shandong]] 3rd Division\n*3rd Division of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*8th [[Brigade]] of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*359th Brigade\n\n==First stage==\nUnder [[Mao Zedong]]'s strategy, the communists were determined to hold Siping to the end.  In order to fortify the city, everyone was mobilized to build bunkers inside the city, while food, ammunition and other supplies were stacked.  [[Lin Biao]] and personally inspected communist fortifications at important defensive positions such as Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) and Three Lines of Groves (San Dao Lin Zi, \u4e09\u9053\u6797\u5b50) with [[Peng Zhen]] in preparation for a prolonged campaign.  Lin Biao also held a conference at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county to plan the strategy of the defense:  To better coordinate the defense of Siping, the communist formed an urban defense command inside the city headed by the Ma Renxing (\u9a6c\u4ec1\u5174), the commander of the communist 1st Brigade, while the general headquarters retreated to the suburb at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county.  In order to boost the morale of defenders, a newspaper titled \"Self Defense Newspaper\" was created with Chen Yi (\u9648\u6c82), the deputy director of the political directorate of the communist general headquarters as the chief editor.  The communist decided to deploy only two regiments in the city to check the nationalist attacks while the bulk of their force would be deployed in the rear, in the region between Siping and Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county and the region between Siping and the Eight Sided City (Ba Mian Cheng, \u516b\u9762\u57ce).  Once the attacking nationalists were checked by the defensive force of the city in fortification, the communists would then concentrate their force to strike the weakest nationalist 71st Army.\n\nOn April 17, 1946, nationalist frontline commander Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) and his deputy Liang Huasheng (\u6881\u534e\u76db) moved their headquarters to Twin Temples (Shuang Miao Zi, \u53cc\u5e99\u5b50) and ordered immediately attack on the city.  On April 18, the railways reaching the city was successfully severed.  Two regiments of the 30th Division of the nationalist 71st Army under the command of Chen Mingren (\u9648\u660e\u4ec1) attacked the enemy positions from the south from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, \u6d77\u4e30\u5c6f), Pobozi (\u6cca\u8116\u5b50), and Duck Lake Pao (Ya Hu Pao, \u9e2d\u6e56\u6ce1) regions, but were beaten back three time consecutively.  After the initial setback, Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) held a military conference on April 19.  The nationalist army and divisional commanders attending the conference concluded that the front attack on the strongly defended enemy positions was impossible, and attacks from flanks or other weak points must be selected instead in order to achieve successful breakthrough.  The railway junctions that provided the link between the 3rd [[Battalion]] of the communist 1st Regiment and the communist 56th Regiment appeared to be a good point for breakthrough.  After the conference, under the heavy artillery cover, the 30th Division of the nationalist New 1st Army launched its offensive on the junction of the two communist units, and the nationalists had successfully taken the enemy position as expected.  The loss of the position at the railway junction signaled that the defensive force inside the city must be strengthened and Lin Biao immediately did so, and informed the defenders in the city.\n\nThe arrival of the reinforcement greatly boosted the morale of the defenders and the advance guard of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division launched a counterassault on the nationalists with the help of other communist units, successfully took back the positions at railway junction previously lost on the same afternoon, while inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalists in the process, and the heavy casualties stopped the offensive of the nationalist 30th Division completely.  After the struggle for Siping had begun, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in their distant headquarters were concerned about the development and both frequently inquired the progress on the battlefield.  Chiang was determined to take Changchun and thus Siping must be taken first to open the path for Changchun, while Mao felt that Siping must be held at all cost and on April 22, Mao telegraphed Lin Biao to order him to hold on and wait for the campaign to turn for the better.  From April 18,  through April 26, 3 divisions from the nationalist New 1st Army and the 71st Army took turns to assault the enemy positions, but were all beaten back by the enemy in favorable terrain.  By the evening of April 26, 1946, heavy casualties forced the offensive of the nationalist 71st Army to a complete stop, while that of the nationalist [[New 1st Army]] was reduced to skirmishes.\n\nAfter failing to make significant progress, the nationalist resorted to artillery to shell the enemy, but resulted in disastrous failure.  The terrain favored the defenders in that there were relatively few artillery positions outside the city for shelling the city, and defenders were well aware these positions.  The nationalists enjoyed numerical superiorities in artillery so these positions were jammed with nationalist batteries.  The enemy defending the city, on the other hand, had fewer artilleries and thus was forced to move around whenever and wherever they were needed, and such frequent and rapid movement to the next new position where artillery support was needed helped the enemy artilleries from being shelled by the nationalist counter-artillery fire.  In contrast, nationalist artillery was the first to fire for most of the time, but after firing, they were not able to move around due to limited positions available and the high concentration of batteries deployed in the few available positions.  As a result, the nationalist batteries became victims of enemy counter-artillery fire and suffered great loss.  When nationalists were forced to withdraw their batteries from the few available artillery positions to avoid losses, the enemy was out of range.  As a result, the attacking nationalists lost the artillery duel.  Mao was happy that the nationalist attack was beaten back again, and on April 27, 1946, telegraphed Lin Biao to praise him and his troop, and asked Lin Biao to deploy one or two more regiments to develop Siping into [[Madrid]] in the East.\n\n==Second stage==\nTo better defend the city, Lin Biao redeployed his forces:  the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division, the 67th Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Brigade of the Northern Manchurian 7th Division entered the city to boost the defense, the 55th Regiment and the 58th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the communist Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column was deployed in southern suburb, the [[Shandong]] 1st Division and 2nd Division were deployed in the northwestern suburb, the 7th Brigade and the 10th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division were deployed in the eastern suburb, and 359th Brigade stationed at [[Gongzhuling]] as reserve.  The 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade of the communist Southern Manchurian 3rd Column had also successfully severed the nationalist supply line between [[Changtu]] and [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], thus slowed down the nationalist push on the city.  To distract nationalist force elsewhere and preventing them from reinforcing their comrades-in-arms attacking Siping, other communist units launched separate attacks on the nationalist positions, and by April 18, all of the final nationalist strongholds in Changchun region fell into the enemy hands, and on April 25, [[Qiqihar]] fell into the enemy hands, and finally on April 28, all of the final nationalist strongholds in [[Harbin]] region fell into the enemy hands.  However, such success only strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's resolve to take Changchun after Siping.\n\nAfter the initial success of the beating back the nationalist attack, the communist high command became overconfident and daydreamed that within ten days, the communist defenders of Siping would go out of the city and annihilate the elite nationalist [[New 1st Army]].  On April 28, 1946, the communist high command telegraphed the entire communist force defending the city by praising them for their success in defending Siping and hoped that they would continue their effort for the final victory, turning [[Siping (city)|Siping]] into another [[Madrid]].  Lin Biao was well aware that the communist force at the time was not capable of fighting with the New 1st Army face to face, and telegraphed back on April 29, claiming that it was impossible to annihilate the New 1st Army at Siping, though this elite nationalist force would definitely be annihilated in [[Northeast China]], it was not the time when defending Siping.  However, the unscathed large communist force in other areas was quite capable of badly mauling the exhausted New 1st Army after the fierce battles at Siping in an ambush at the favorable terrain and under the cover of darkness and bad weather, and such ambush was planned later on the presumed nationalist attack on Changchun.  Du Yuming, the brilliant nationalist commander would not provide the enemy with such opportunity they wanted and thus would consequently foil the enemy's hope by successfully convincing Chiang Kai-shek instead of immediately continuing to take Changchun after taking Siping as originally planned, the exhausted nationalists would stop at Siping regroup and re-supply, hence avoiding any possible ambush or counterattacks by the enemy.\n\nConfident that the nationalists would be able to completely annihilate the communist enemy and would be able to first take Northeast China and then the entire [[China]] afterward, on April 30, 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] turned down [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties in [[China]], and both the nationalists and the communists realized that any gains in the following peace negotiations would come from the victories in the battlefield.  On April 1, Mao Zedong telegrammed Lin Biao, giving the latter the following orders:  First, Lin Biao would have the overall control of the communist political and military power in Northeast China and if help was needed, [[Gao Gang]] would be sent.  Second, the nationalists had turned down the [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties and insisted on taking Changchun, so Siping and [[Benxi]] must be held to the end so that the enemy (nationalists) would exhaust its supplies and ammunitions to the point that it would take at least six months to resupply, and thus providing time for us (communists) to strengthen ourselves (communists) at Changchun and [[Harbin]] for better positions in the peace negotiation followed.  Third, concentrating our (communist) force to achieve victory.\n\nAfter setbacks outside the Siping, the nationalists believed that the situation in Northeast China depended the successful taking of the city, and after Siping was taken from the enemy, the overall situation for the nationalist in Northeast China would immediately be improved significantly, and thus the city must be taken at all cost.  The elite nationalist New 6th Army under the command of [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) was first airlifted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to Northeast China, and made its move to Siping from [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], [[Xifeng County, Liaoning]], and the Town of [[Yehe Nara]] (Ye He Zhen, \u53f6\u8d6b\u9547).  With the arrival of the new reinforcement, the nationalists planned to concentrate their forces to take Siping and then take the city of Eternal Auspiciousness (Yong Ji, \u6c38\u5409) and Changchun. In preparation, the 14th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist New 6th Army was deployed to [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]] from [[Liaoyang]] and [[Benxi]], the nationalist 93rd Army was also deployed to Northeast China from [[Beijing]].  In addition, the nationalist [[air force]] concentrated all of its available aircraft in the region to support the offensive on the ground.\n\n==Third stage==\nOn May 15, Du Yuming gave the order to launch a general assault on the Siping and declared to his men that the city must be taken this time.  The nationalist assault came in three fronts:  the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy's left flank, targeting cities including [[Gongzhuling]], [[Meihekou]], [[Changchun]] and Qitamu (\u5176\u5854\u6728).  The [[New 1st Army]]  on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take [[Shuangcheng]] and [[Dehui]] after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of [[Songhua River]].  Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack enemy's right flank, targeting Zheng Family's Village (Zheng Jia Tun, \u90d1\u5bb6\u5c6f) and [[Shuangcheng]].  On May 15, 1946, with 10 times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located to the east of Siping and south of Hafu (\u54c8\u798f).  After severe casualties, the enemy was forced to give up peak # 258.\n\nOn May 17, Du Yuming ordered the nationalist 195th Division in reserve into action and soon took Hafu (\u54c8\u798f), and surrounded the most critical point of defense of the city, the highest point in the east, a hill called Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) located 10&nbsp;km to the southeast of the city.  Excited about the progress, Du reported to Chiang Kai-shek that Siping would be taken soon.  Chiang, on the other hands, was not so sure and worried that the nationalist offensive would once more suffer a setback, sent the nationalist Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Republic of China)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Bai Chongxi]] to Northeast China to investigate.  The night Bai reached [[Shenyang]], Bai told Du Yuming that Chiang had felt the battle to take Siping took too long, and he could not wait any longer.  As long as Siping was taken, the nationalists would have a better position on the peace negotiation table than their communist enemy and taking Changchun would be after taking Siping.\n\nBoth sides were well aware the importance of the hill and nationalists launched multiple assaults on the hill, and all were beaten back by the communist 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division defending the hill.  The nationalists then concentrate all available firepower to bombard the enemy position with an area around a hundred square metres at the hilltop at a rate of more than 30 rounds per minute, and the under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the nationalist New 6th Army under its commander [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) attacked the hill from three sides in the east, the south, and the west.  After beating back nationalist attacks for six times, it was obvious reinforcement was needed.  The communist 10th Brigade was ordered to reinforce Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) but they were delayed when crossing the [[Liao River]], and this was the most important reason caused the eventual abandonment of city.\n\nIt was obvious that it would be only a matter of time before the communist stronghold at Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) to be taken by the attacking nationalists, and with neither the technical nor the numerical superiority, Lin Biao felt it was much more important to preserve the communist strength for the future and he radioed Mao Zedong on May 18, to report the situation and intention to abandon the city.  After sending the message, Lin Biao ordered a general withdraw without waiting for the Mao's reply, and by midnight, the general withdraw in an orderly fashion was completed in total secrecy.  Next morning, the nationalists entered and secured the city, and only after that did Mao's reply came on May 19, in which Mao finally changed his mind and agreed with Lin Biao.  Had Lin Biao waited, his entire force in the city would be annihilated.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe brilliance of the frontline commanders on both sides was obvious toward the end and after the campaign.  Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed with the taking of Siping and ordered the nationalists to immediately continue their attack and to take Changchun without a break, so that the enemy would not have the chance to regroup.  Du Yuming, the nationalist frontline commander was well aware that his exhausted force must rest and regroup for sometime before launching anymore attacks on the enemy.  Furthermore, Du and his fellow officers were also keenly aware that the majority of the enemy force in the rural regions was unscathed and was waiting to ambush them out in the open if the exhausted nationalists had ventured into the terrain hostile to the mechanized force.  Du and his officers were determined not to give the enemy the opportunity they had been waiting for, and in a rare example among Chiang's most trusted subordinates, Du Yuming refused to carry out Chiang's order and successfully convinced Chiang to stop the planned offensive to allow the nationalists to consolidate their gains in [[Northeast China]], and thus foiled the enemy's hope of possible ambush.\n\nEqually brilliant, the communist commander Lin Biao dared to ignore Mao Zedong's order and withdrew from the city on his own, thus successfully avoided total annihilation of his defending force by the numerically and technically superior adversary.  However, Lin Biao was more fortunate than his counterpart in that he did not have to convince Mao for his decision and actions because Mao had realized his error and concurred with what Lin Biao's had done.  However, neither Chiang's original plan of continuing to take Changchun nor Mao's original plan of holding Siping had materialized and thus the campaign ended in a stalemate.\n\n==External links==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070701054002/http://www.coldwarchina.com/zgyj/zgnz/000714.html (Chinese)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, ''Liberation War History'', 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2000, {{ISBN|7-80149-207-2}} (set)\n*Zhang, Ping, ''History of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-5006-0081-X}} (pbk.)\n*Jie, Lifu, ''Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates'', 1st Edition, [[Hebei]] People's Publishing House in [[Shijiazhuang]], 1990, {{ISBN|7-202-00733-9}} (set)\n*Literary and Historical Research Committee of the [[Anhui]] Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], ''Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Anhui]] People's Publishing House in [[Hefei]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-212-00007-8}}\n*Li, Zuomin, ''Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] Party History Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2004, {{ISBN|7-80199-029-3}}\n*Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, ''Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[People's Liberation Army]] Literature and Art Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2001, {{ISBN|7-5033-1351-X}} (set)\n*Huang, Youlan, ''History of the Chinese People's Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1992, {{ISBN|7-80019-338-1}}\n*Liu Wusheng, ''From [[Yan'an]] to [[Beijing]]: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993, {{ISBN|7-5073-0074-9}}\n*Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, ''History of Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] in Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993 &ndash; 1997, {{ISBN|7-80021-719-1}} (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5)\n*Harold M.

The nationalists have combined this campaign with the [[Battle of Siping]] as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the [[Battle of Siping]].  More importantly, the nationalists in the [[Battle of Siping]] was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly [[Warlord era|warlords]] ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after [[World War II]], and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region.  In fact, in the [[Battle of Siping]], Chiang's own force did not even participated in the fights.  This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the defeat of [[Jinjiatun Campaign]], the nationalists resumed their offensive with vengeance.  In a short period of just two days, the nationalists were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping.  [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was determined to take [[Changchun]] after taking Siping, and [[Mao Zedong]] was equally determined to hold Siping  to the end and prevent the nationalists from taking both Siping and Changchun.  Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge:  [[Du Yuming]] for the nationalists and [[Lin Biao]] for the communists.\n\n==Order of battle==\nAttackers: nationalist [[order of battle]]:\n*[[New 1st Army]]\n*[[New 6th Army]]\n*71st Army\n*93rd Army\n*Army-sized 207th Division of the Youth Army\nDefenders: communist [[order of battle]]:\n* Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column\n*Southern Manchurian 3rd Column\n*Western Manchurian 3rd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*Northern Manchurian 7th Division\n*[[Shandong]] 1st Division\n*[[Shandong]] 2nd Division\n*[[Shandong]] 3rd Division\n*3rd Division of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*8th [[Brigade]] of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*359th Brigade\n\n==First stage==\nUnder [[Mao Zedong]]'s strategy, the communists were determined to hold Siping to the end.  In order to fortify the city, everyone was mobilized to build bunkers inside the city, while food, ammunition and other supplies were stacked.  [[Lin Biao]] and personally inspected communist fortifications at important defensive positions such as Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) and Three Lines of Groves (San Dao Lin Zi, \u4e09\u9053\u6797\u5b50) with [[Peng Zhen]] in preparation for a prolonged campaign.  Lin Biao also held a conference at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county to plan the strategy of the defense:  To better coordinate the defense of Siping, the communist formed an urban defense command inside the city headed by the Ma Renxing (\u9a6c\u4ec1\u5174), the commander of the communist 1st Brigade, while the general headquarters retreated to the suburb at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county.  In order to boost the morale of defenders, a newspaper titled \"Self Defense Newspaper\" was created with Chen Yi (\u9648\u6c82), the deputy director of the political directorate of the communist general headquarters as the chief editor.  The communist decided to deploy only two regiments in the city to check the nationalist attacks while the bulk of their force would be deployed in the rear, in the region between Siping and Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county and the region between Siping and the Eight Sided City (Ba Mian Cheng, \u516b\u9762\u57ce).  Once the attacking nationalists were checked by the defensive force of the city in fortification, the communists would then concentrate their force to strike the weakest nationalist 71st Army.\n\nOn April 17, 1946, nationalist frontline commander Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) and his deputy Liang Huasheng (\u6881\u534e\u76db) moved their headquarters to Twin Temples (Shuang Miao Zi, \u53cc\u5e99\u5b50) and ordered immediately attack on the city.  On April 18, the railways reaching the city was successfully severed.  Two regiments of the 30th Division of the nationalist 71st Army under the command of Chen Mingren (\u9648\u660e\u4ec1) attacked the enemy positions from the south from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, \u6d77\u4e30\u5c6f), Pobozi (\u6cca\u8116\u5b50), and Duck Lake Pao (Ya Hu Pao, \u9e2d\u6e56\u6ce1) regions, but were beaten back three time consecutively.  After the initial setback, Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) held a military conference on April 19.  The nationalist army and divisional commanders attending the conference concluded that the front attack on the strongly defended enemy positions was impossible, and attacks from flanks or other weak points must be selected instead in order to achieve successful breakthrough.  The railway junctions that provided the link between the 3rd [[Battalion]] of the communist 1st Regiment and the communist 56th Regiment appeared to be a good point for breakthrough.  After the conference, under the heavy artillery cover, the 30th Division of the nationalist New 1st Army launched its offensive on the junction of the two communist units, and the nationalists had successfully taken the enemy position as expected.  The loss of the position at the railway junction signaled that the defensive force inside the city must be strengthened and Lin Biao immediately did so, and informed the defenders in the city.\n\nThe arrival of the reinforcement greatly boosted the morale of the defenders and the advance guard of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division launched a counterassault on the nationalists with the help of other communist units, successfully took back the positions at railway junction previously lost on the same afternoon, while inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalists in the process, and the heavy casualties stopped the offensive of the nationalist 30th Division completely.  After the struggle for Siping had begun, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in their distant headquarters were concerned about the development and both frequently inquired the progress on the battlefield.  Chiang was determined to take Changchun and thus Siping must be taken first to open the path for Changchun, while Mao felt that Siping must be held at all cost and on April 22, Mao telegraphed Lin Biao to order him to hold on and wait for the campaign to turn for the better.  From April 18,  through April 26, 3 divisions from the nationalist New 1st Army and the 71st Army took turns to assault the enemy positions, but were all beaten back by the enemy in favorable terrain.  By the evening of April 26, 1946, heavy casualties forced the offensive of the nationalist 71st Army to a complete stop, while that of the nationalist [[New 1st Army]] was reduced to skirmishes.\n\nAfter failing to make significant progress, the nationalist resorted to artillery to shell the enemy, but resulted in disastrous failure.  The terrain favored the defenders in that there were relatively few artillery positions outside the city for shelling the city, and defenders were well aware these positions.  The nationalists enjoyed numerical superiorities in artillery so these positions were jammed with nationalist batteries.  The enemy defending the city, on the other hand, had fewer artilleries and thus was forced to move around whenever and wherever they were needed, and such frequent and rapid movement to the next new position where artillery support was needed helped the enemy artilleries from being shelled by the nationalist counter-artillery fire.  In contrast, nationalist artillery was the first to fire for most of the time, but after firing, they were not able to move around due to limited positions available and the high concentration of batteries deployed in the few available positions.  As a result, the nationalist batteries became victims of enemy counter-artillery fire and suffered great loss.  When nationalists were forced to withdraw their batteries from the few available artillery positions to avoid losses, the enemy was out of range.  As a result, the attacking nationalists lost the artillery duel.  Mao was happy that the nationalist attack was beaten back again, and on April 27, 1946, telegraphed Lin Biao to praise him and his troop, and asked Lin Biao to deploy one or two more regiments to develop Siping into [[Madrid]] in the East.\n\n==Second stage==\nTo better defend the city, Lin Biao redeployed his forces:  the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division, the 67th Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Brigade of the Northern Manchurian 7th Division entered the city to boost the defense, the 55th Regiment and the 58th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the communist Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column was deployed in southern suburb, the [[Shandong]] 1st Division and 2nd Division were deployed in the northwestern suburb, the 7th Brigade and the 10th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division were deployed in the eastern suburb, and 359th Brigade stationed at [[Gongzhuling]] as reserve.  The 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade of the communist Southern Manchurian 3rd Column had also successfully severed the nationalist supply line between [[Changtu]] and [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], thus slowed down the nationalist push on the city.  To distract nationalist force elsewhere and preventing them from reinforcing their comrades-in-arms attacking Siping, other communist units launched separate attacks on the nationalist positions, and by April 18, all of the final nationalist strongholds in Changchun region fell into the enemy hands, and on April 25, [[Qiqihar]] fell into the enemy hands, and finally on April 28, all of the final nationalist strongholds in [[Harbin]] region fell into the enemy hands.  However, such success only strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's resolve to take Changchun after Siping.\n\nAfter the initial success of the beating back the nationalist attack, the communist high command became overconfident and daydreamed that within ten days, the communist defenders of Siping would go out of the city and annihilate the elite nationalist [[New 1st Army]].  On April 28, 1946, the communist high command telegraphed the entire communist force defending the city by praising them for their success in defending Siping and hoped that they would continue their effort for the final victory, turning [[Siping (city)|Siping]] into another [[Madrid]].  Lin Biao was well aware that the communist force at the time was not capable of fighting with the New 1st Army face to face, and telegraphed back on April 29, claiming that it was impossible to annihilate the New 1st Army at Siping, though this elite nationalist force would definitely be annihilated in [[Northeast China]], it was not the time when defending Siping.  However, the unscathed large communist force in other areas was quite capable of badly mauling the exhausted New 1st Army after the fierce battles at Siping in an ambush at the favorable terrain and under the cover of darkness and bad weather, and such ambush was planned later on the presumed nationalist attack on Changchun.  Du Yuming, the brilliant nationalist commander would not provide the enemy with such opportunity they wanted and thus would consequently foil the enemy's hope by successfully convincing Chiang Kai-shek instead of immediately continuing to take Changchun after taking Siping as originally planned, the exhausted nationalists would stop at Siping regroup and re-supply, hence avoiding any possible ambush or counterattacks by the enemy.\n\nConfident that the nationalists would be able to completely annihilate the communist enemy and would be able to first take Northeast China and then the entire [[China]] afterward, on April 30, 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] turned down [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties in [[China]], and both the nationalists and the communists realized that any gains in the following peace negotiations would come from the victories in the battlefield.  On April 1, Mao Zedong telegrammed Lin Biao, giving the latter the following orders:  First, Lin Biao would have the overall control of the communist political and military power in Northeast China and if help was needed, [[Gao Gang]] would be sent.  Second, the nationalists had turned down the [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties and insisted on taking Changchun, so Siping and [[Benxi]] must be held to the end so that the enemy (nationalists) would exhaust its supplies and ammunitions to the point that it would take at least six months to resupply, and thus providing time for us (communists) to strengthen ourselves (communists) at Changchun and [[Harbin]] for better positions in the peace negotiation followed.  Third, concentrating our (communist) force to achieve victory.\n\nAfter setbacks outside the Siping, the nationalists believed that the situation in Northeast China depended the successful taking of the city, and after Siping was taken from the enemy, the overall situation for the nationalist in Northeast China would immediately be improved significantly, and thus the city must be taken at all cost.  The elite nationalist New 6th Army under the command of [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) was first airlifted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to Northeast China, and made its move to Siping from [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], [[Xifeng County, Liaoning]], and the Town of [[Yehe Nara]] (Ye He Zhen, \u53f6\u8d6b\u9547).  With the arrival of the new reinforcement, the nationalists planned to concentrate their forces to take Siping and then take the city of Eternal Auspiciousness (Yong Ji, \u6c38\u5409) and Changchun. In preparation, the 14th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist New 6th Army was deployed to [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]] from [[Liaoyang]] and [[Benxi]], the nationalist 93rd Army was also deployed to Northeast China from [[Beijing]].  In addition, the nationalist [[air force]] concentrated all of its available aircraft in the region to support the offensive on the ground.\n\n==Third stage==\nOn May 15, Du Yuming gave the order to launch a general assault on the Siping and declared to his men that the city must be taken this time.  The nationalist assault came in three fronts:  the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy's left flank, targeting cities including [[Gongzhuling]], [[Meihekou]], [[Changchun]] and Qitamu (\u5176\u5854\u6728).  The [[New 1st Army]]  on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take [[Shuangcheng]] and [[Dehui]] after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of [[Songhua River]].  Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack enemy's right flank, targeting Zheng Family's Village (Zheng Jia Tun, \u90d1\u5bb6\u5c6f) and [[Shuangcheng]].  On May 15, 1946, with 10 times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located to the east of Siping and south of Hafu (\u54c8\u798f).  After severe casualties, the enemy was forced to give up peak # 258.\n\nOn May 17, Du Yuming ordered the nationalist 195th Division in reserve into action and soon took Hafu (\u54c8\u798f), and surrounded the most critical point of defense of the city, the highest point in the east, a hill called Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) located 10&nbsp;km to the southeast of the city.  Excited about the progress, Du reported to Chiang Kai-shek that Siping would be taken soon.  Chiang, on the other hands, was not so sure and worried that the nationalist offensive would once more suffer a setback, sent the nationalist Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Republic of China)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Bai Chongxi]] to Northeast China to investigate.  The night Bai reached [[Shenyang]], Bai told Du Yuming that Chiang had felt the battle to take Siping took too long, and he could not wait any longer.  As long as Siping was taken, the nationalists would have a better position on the peace negotiation table than their communist enemy and taking Changchun would be after taking Siping.\n\nBoth sides were well aware the importance of the hill and nationalists launched multiple assaults on the hill, and all were beaten back by the communist 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division defending the hill.  The nationalists then concentrate all available firepower to bombard the enemy position with an area around a hundred square metres at the hilltop at a rate of more than 30 rounds per minute, and the under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the nationalist New 6th Army under its commander [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) attacked the hill from three sides in the east, the south, and the west.  After beating back nationalist attacks for six times, it was obvious reinforcement was needed.  The communist 10th Brigade was ordered to reinforce Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) but they were delayed when crossing the [[Liao River]], and this was the most important reason caused the eventual abandonment of city.\n\nIt was obvious that it would be only a matter of time before the communist stronghold at Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) to be taken by the attacking nationalists, and with neither the technical nor the numerical superiority, Lin Biao felt it was much more important to preserve the communist strength for the future and he radioed Mao Zedong on May 18, to report the situation and intention to abandon the city.  After sending the message, Lin Biao ordered a general withdraw without waiting for the Mao's reply, and by midnight, the general withdraw in an orderly fashion was completed in total secrecy.  Next morning, the nationalists entered and secured the city, and only after that did Mao's reply came on May 19, in which Mao finally changed his mind and agreed with Lin Biao.  Had Lin Biao waited, his entire force in the city would be annihilated.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe brilliance of the frontline commanders on both sides was obvious toward the end and after the campaign.  Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed with the taking of Siping and ordered the nationalists to immediately continue their attack and to take Changchun without a break, so that the enemy would not have the chance to regroup.  Du Yuming, the nationalist frontline commander was well aware that his exhausted force must rest and regroup for sometime before launching anymore attacks on the enemy.  Furthermore, Du and his fellow officers were also keenly aware that the majority of the enemy force in the rural regions was unscathed and was waiting to ambush them out in the open if the exhausted nationalists had ventured into the terrain hostile to the mechanized force.  Du and his officers were determined not to give the enemy the opportunity they had been waiting for, and in a rare example among Chiang's most trusted subordinates, Du Yuming refused to carry out Chiang's order and successfully convinced Chiang to stop the planned offensive to allow the nationalists to consolidate their gains in [[Northeast China]], and thus foiled the enemy's hope of possible ambush.\n\nEqually brilliant, the communist commander Lin Biao dared to ignore Mao Zedong's order and withdrew from the city on his own, thus successfully avoided total annihilation of his defending force by the numerically and technically superior adversary.  However, Lin Biao was more fortunate than his counterpart in that he did not have to convince Mao for his decision and actions because Mao had realized his error and concurred with what Lin Biao's had done.  However, neither Chiang's original plan of continuing to take Changchun nor Mao's original plan of holding Siping had materialized and thus the campaign ended in a stalemate.\n\n==External links==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070701054002/http://www.coldwarchina.com/zgyj/zgnz/000714.html (Chinese)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, ''Liberation War History'', 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2000, {{ISBN|7-80149-207-2}} (set)\n*Zhang, Ping, ''History of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-5006-0081-X}} (pbk.)\n*Jie, Lifu, ''Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates'', 1st Edition, [[Hebei]] People's Publishing House in [[Shijiazhuang]], 1990, {{ISBN|7-202-00733-9}} (set)\n*Literary and Historical Research Committee of the [[Anhui]] Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], ''Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Anhui]] People's Publishing House in [[Hefei]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-212-00007-8}}\n*Li, Zuomin, ''Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] Party History Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2004, {{ISBN|7-80199-029-3}}\n*Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, ''Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[People's Liberation Army]] Literature and Art Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2001, {{ISBN|7-5033-1351-X}} (set)\n*Huang, Youlan, ''History of the Chinese People's Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1992, {{ISBN|7-80019-338-1}}\n*Liu Wusheng, ''From [[Yan'an]] to [[Beijing]]: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993, {{ISBN|7-5073-0074-9}}\n*Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, ''History of Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] in Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993 &ndash; 1997, {{ISBN|7-80021-719-1}} (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5)\n*Harold M.

Peter|Harry G. Peter's]] original 1943 design. After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes, were re-imagined and reintroduced. Prior to this reboot, Doctor Psycho demonstrated a command over the occult and was able to harness supernatural energies to project illusions. Since his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] reintroduction, the character has been presented as a powerful telepath and telekenetic. Despite these changes, Doctor Psycho has consistently been portrayed as a [[Dwarfism|little person]] suffering from mental illness (ranging from mild obsessiveness to full-blown [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]), who harbors a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] hatred of women.\n\nDoctor Psycho made his animation debut as a regular in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', with his voice provided by actor and comedian [[Tony Hale]].\n\n==Background==\nThe character of Doctor Psycho was created by [[William Moulton Marston]], creator of Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures, as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatred, as well as to be another embodiment of what he called \"less actively developed men\" (emotionally misaligned) who needed emotional reform by a love leader (Wonder Woman).   [[William Moulton Marston]]'s creation of Doctor Psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism.  Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women. The character was partly inspired by actor [[Lon Chaney]] (\"Man of a thousand faces\") and partly by Marston's undergraduate advisor [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]], who was opposed to women's suffrage and feminism, and was into metaphysics.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Lepore | first = Jill | authorlink = Jill Lepore | title = The Last Amazon | magazine = The New Yorker | year = 2014 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon}}</ref> Doctor Psycho was also one of [[List of Wonder Woman enemies#Cult leaders|several villains]] created for Wonder Woman who were occultists, beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes.\n\nAs Wonder Woman's [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|rogues]] and [[List of Wonder Woman supporting characters|supporting cast]] were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the issues, Doctor Psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]], [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]], and [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] adventures. The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' issues.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\nDoctor Psycho first appears as a pawn of the [[Duke of Deception]]. The [[Ares (DC Comics)|God of War]], enraged that women were gaining power in Earth society and potentially threatening his ability to engulf the world in war, ordered Deception to discredit women. Deception called upon Doctor Psycho to set about eliminating women from the war effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2010 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9 |page=44}}</ref>\n\nDoctor Psycho was revealed in flashback to have been a medical student who was frequently humiliated by his peers. He discovered that his fianc\u00e9e Marva Jane Gray was in love with college athletic champion Ben Bradley. Bradley removed him as a rival for Marva's affections by stealing $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fianc\u00e9 as the culprit.\n\nConvicted on the basis of Marva's testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing an intense hatred of all women. Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice. Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments.\n\nLearning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions.\n\nAt Deception's urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of [[George Washington]], claiming that women were hindering the war effort. He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of Military Intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage.\n\nWith the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #5</ref> Doctor Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman.\n\nFreed from Psycho's influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #20</ref>\n\nPsycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power. He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta's suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #18</ref>\n\nIn the Golden Age, Psycho's brother [[Ironsides (DC Comics)|Ironsides]] was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain. Ironsides invented the Iron Giant's disguise. He did not, however, display any superpowers.\n\nPsycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium. Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor's [[unconscious mind]] and became the powerful Captain Wonder, who teamed up with the [[Silver Swan (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Silver Swan]] to destroy Wonder Woman. His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber.\n\nWhen the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman's other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and [[Etta Candy]], who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowered version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #323</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\nHe is a telepath with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's dreams. Psycho was enlisted by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman's close friend, [[Vanessa Kapatelis]], with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons. Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis' damaged psyche to turn her into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nDr. Psycho's plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facility, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were in telepathic range. When [[Saturn Girl]] mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks.\n\nIn the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Working with [[Talia al Ghul]], he recruits many supervillains for the Society, and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The presence of the man's loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho that he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the [[Marvel Family]]. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected.\n\nAfter the events of the 6th issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]],'' Psycho travels with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth. He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. The villains lose this battle.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\n[[One Year Later]], Doctor Psycho is arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he uses his mind-controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in the courtroom hostage.\n\nThis forces Spencer to try to put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers.\n\nDoctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' miniseries. He has been working with former enemy [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] for [[Vandal Savage]] and hiring various villains to put out hits on other Secret Six members. In the final issue of ''Secret Six'' (December 2006), he is stabbed repeatedly and seriously injured by the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]].\n\nHe resurfaced with his powers restored and amplified by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] series beginning in 2006. He was assisting [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Giganta]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #01</ref>\n\nOn the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Doctor Psycho as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].\n\nDuring the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was sent to the DMA (Department of Metahuman Affairs) Headquarters to retrieve Doctor Psycho, who is held captive there.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #27</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Psycho first appears in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]''; a con man psychic who practices [[seance]], using his telepathy to steal identities of customers in [[Manhattan]]. The purpose of this guise is to hide from the [[H.I.V.E.]], who are hunting those with telepathic abilities. He first encounters [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] after hearing about aliens in the city. His [[astral projection|astral form]] is unintentionally pulled into Superboy's mind, who is fighting [[Plasmus]].<ref>''Superboy'' #18 (May 2013)</ref>\n\nAfter learning of Superboy's origin, which remains unknown to Superboy, he attempts to befriend him. The two are attacked by agents of H.I.V.E, which they defeat. They form an alliance against the organization.<ref>''Superboy'' #20 (July 2013)</ref> During their investigation, they run into a girl with psionic powers named Sarah, her powers manifest into a being called Decay; she had been previously experimented on by the H.I.V.E.<ref>''Superboy'' #21 (August 2013)</ref>\n\nHe later appears in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #11, where he is on the Metropolis prison talking with [[Psimon]]. Then he appears in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #13, where he is trying to get [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s powers, but he accidentally looks into her mind, where he sees her killing him.\n\nLater during the \"[[Trinity War]]\" storyline, [[Question (comics)|Question]] gives Superman a newspaper clipping stating that Doctor Psycho was sighted in [[Khandaq]] the day when [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] was killed. This causes Superman, Question, and the Justice League to go after Doctor Psycho.<ref name=\"Justice League Dark #22\">''Justice League Dark'' #22</ref> Superman, Question, and the others arrive in Pittsburgh to confront Doctor Psycho. Martian Manhunter looks into Doctor Psycho's mind and learns that he was sent to Kahndaq by the Secret Society, but did not do anything to control Superman's mind.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, Doctor Psycho is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref name=\"Justice League Dark #22\"/> Then he appears in ''Justice League'' vol. 2 #29, where he is sent by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], along with the [[Fearsome Five]] and [[Hector Hammond]], to fight against [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the [[Metal Men]]. He ends up being defeated by Gold.\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nAfter the events of ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Doctor Psycho's history had been altered. Using his illusions to pose as a scientist for [[A.R.G.U.S.]] named Dr. Edward Carne, Doctor Psycho was first seen after [[Silver Swan (comics)|Vanessa Kapatelis]] was defeated and brought into custody by Wonder Woman. As Doctor Carne, Psycho told Wonder Woman that when Vanessa woke from her comatose state that he would be there for her.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #40 (April 2018)</ref>\n\nLater, Doctor Psycho was one of several powerful psychics kidnapped by [[Amanda Waller]] to hack into [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s mind.<ref>''Justice League: No Justice'' #1 (2018)</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Doctor Psycho is among the villains that attend an underground meeting held by the [[Riddler]], where they talk about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPsycho is a skilled occultist, and uses [[psionic]] powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] appearances, he was a hypnotist skilled in the occult who used his victims to draw ectoplasm into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn ''The New 52'' continuity, Doctor Psycho possesses psychic abilities including the regular telepathy, mind control, astral projection, telekinesis, levitation, projecting destructive blasts of psionic energy and creating psionic energy constructs such as armor, although Edgar has stated that he possesses every psionic power imaginable. However, he does not have the energy required to use his abilities to their fullest. He can overcome this weakness by siphoning mental energies from other individuals with psionic powers such as Superboy.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Wonder Woman '77===\nDoctor Psycho appears in the second story from ''[[Wonder Woman '77]]'', a series based on the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman TV series]], though he did not have any appearances in that television series. The doctor escapes a mental institution and abducts Wonder Woman. Using his telepathic machines, Doctor Psycho convinces Diana that she is no longer Wonder Woman. The superheroine escapes his mental labyrinth and defeats Doctor Psycho and his illusions, returning him to the mental institution.<ref>''Wonder Woman '77 Special'' #1 (2015)</ref>\n\n===Wonder Woman: Earth One===\nDoctor Psycho appears as a primary antagonist in the second volume of ''[[Wonder Woman: Earth One]]'' by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Yanick Paquette]]. This version of the character is Dr. Leon Zeiko, a pick-up artist who manipulates Wonder Woman.\n\n===Gods and Monsters===\nDoctor Psycho appears in the tie-in comics of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'' under the identity of '''Dr. Jackson Alpert''', who's working for a [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] project called [[MKUltra]], where they used psychotropic drugs to experiment on human beings without their knowledge or permission, all because they wanted to control people. But Alpert wanted to set them free, bring them to the next level of evolution. Because of this disagreement, he left the C.I.A. project and joined the \"Hairies\" on The Farm in New York, where he conducted his experiments on people with the chemicals developed by him in his lab, but their experiments went awry, turning them into wild, violent creatures, disgusting [[Bekka]], the Wonder Woman. Thanks to Bekka's crystal gems created by her [[Mother Box]], Doctor Psycho advanced in his experiments, but his misrepresented goals turned people in his lab into monsters. Despite this he founded The Eternity Institute in [[Switzerland]] and all he'd achieved\u2014the extraordinary advances in science, medicine and technology\u2014over the next forty years Alpert became a notorious recluse, never being seen in public and secretly harvesting DNA of the [[Justice League]]. He was the one who created the [[Forever People]], claiming to be the result of his efforts to develop humanity and lead them to a new world of peace and order, devoting to wipe out disease, poverty and war. But beneath all a veneer of goodness and altruism lay the essence of a greedy man, and in his dying days, evolved into [[Imperiex]] using DNA of the League and the Forever Formula. He was defeated and Bekka beheaded the evil doctor with her sword.<ref>''Justice League: Gods and Monsters'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* \"Doctor Psycho\" is the title of the fourth episode of the fourth season of the TV series ''[[Orange is the New Black]]''.

After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes, were re-imagined and reintroduced. Prior to this reboot, Doctor Psycho demonstrated a command over the occult and was able to harness supernatural energies to project illusions. Since his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] reintroduction, the character has been presented as a powerful telepath and telekenetic. Despite these changes, Doctor Psycho has consistently been portrayed as a [[Dwarfism|little person]] suffering from mental illness (ranging from mild obsessiveness to full-blown [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]), who harbors a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] hatred of women.\n\nDoctor Psycho made his animation debut as a regular in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', with his voice provided by actor and comedian [[Tony Hale]].\n\n==Background==\nThe character of Doctor Psycho was created by [[William Moulton Marston]], creator of Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures, as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatred, as well as to be another embodiment of what he called \"less actively developed men\" (emotionally misaligned) who needed emotional reform by a love leader (Wonder Woman).   [[William Moulton Marston]]'s creation of Doctor Psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism.  Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women. The character was partly inspired by actor [[Lon Chaney]] (\"Man of a thousand faces\") and partly by Marston's undergraduate advisor [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]], who was opposed to women's suffrage and feminism, and was into metaphysics.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Lepore | first = Jill | authorlink = Jill Lepore | title = The Last Amazon | magazine = The New Yorker | year = 2014 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon}}</ref> Doctor Psycho was also one of [[List of Wonder Woman enemies#Cult leaders|several villains]] created for Wonder Woman who were occultists, beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes.\n\nAs Wonder Woman's [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|rogues]] and [[List of Wonder Woman supporting characters|supporting cast]] were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the issues, Doctor Psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]], [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]], and [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] adventures. The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' issues.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\nDoctor Psycho first appears as a pawn of the [[Duke of Deception]]. The [[Ares (DC Comics)|God of War]], enraged that women were gaining power in Earth society and potentially threatening his ability to engulf the world in war, ordered Deception to discredit women. Deception called upon Doctor Psycho to set about eliminating women from the war effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2010 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9 |page=44}}</ref>\n\nDoctor Psycho was revealed in flashback to have been a medical student who was frequently humiliated by his peers. He discovered that his fianc\u00e9e Marva Jane Gray was in love with college athletic champion Ben Bradley. Bradley removed him as a rival for Marva's affections by stealing $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fianc\u00e9 as the culprit.\n\nConvicted on the basis of Marva's testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing an intense hatred of all women. Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice. Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments.\n\nLearning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions.\n\nAt Deception's urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of [[George Washington]], claiming that women were hindering the war effort. He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of Military Intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage.\n\nWith the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #5</ref> Doctor Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman.\n\nFreed from Psycho's influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #20</ref>\n\nPsycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power. He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta's suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #18</ref>\n\nIn the Golden Age, Psycho's brother [[Ironsides (DC Comics)|Ironsides]] was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain. Ironsides invented the Iron Giant's disguise. He did not, however, display any superpowers.\n\nPsycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium. Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor's [[unconscious mind]] and became the powerful Captain Wonder, who teamed up with the [[Silver Swan (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Silver Swan]] to destroy Wonder Woman. His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber.\n\nWhen the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman's other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and [[Etta Candy]], who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowered version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #323</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\nHe is a telepath with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's dreams. Psycho was enlisted by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman's close friend, [[Vanessa Kapatelis]], with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons. Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis' damaged psyche to turn her into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nDr. Psycho's plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facility, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were in telepathic range. When [[Saturn Girl]] mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks.\n\nIn the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Working with [[Talia al Ghul]], he recruits many supervillains for the Society, and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The presence of the man's loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho that he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the [[Marvel Family]]. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected.\n\nAfter the events of the 6th issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]],'' Psycho travels with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth. He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. The villains lose this battle.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\n[[One Year Later]], Doctor Psycho is arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he uses his mind-controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in the courtroom hostage.\n\nThis forces Spencer to try to put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers.\n\nDoctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' miniseries. He has been working with former enemy [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] for [[Vandal Savage]] and hiring various villains to put out hits on other Secret Six members. In the final issue of ''Secret Six'' (December 2006), he is stabbed repeatedly and seriously injured by the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]].\n\nHe resurfaced with his powers restored and amplified by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] series beginning in 2006. He was assisting [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Giganta]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #01</ref>\n\nOn the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Doctor Psycho as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].\n\nDuring the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was sent to the DMA (Department of Metahuman Affairs) Headquarters to retrieve Doctor Psycho, who is held captive there.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #27</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Psycho first appears in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]''; a con man psychic who practices [[seance]], using his telepathy to steal identities of customers in [[Manhattan]]. The purpose of this guise is to hide from the [[H.I.V.E.]], who are hunting those with telepathic abilities. He first encounters [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] after hearing about aliens in the city. His [[astral projection|astral form]] is unintentionally pulled into Superboy's mind, who is fighting [[Plasmus]].<ref>''Superboy'' #18 (May 2013)</ref>\n\nAfter learning of Superboy's origin, which remains unknown to Superboy, he attempts to befriend him. The two are attacked by agents of H.I.V.E, which they defeat. They form an alliance against the organization.<ref>''Superboy'' #20 (July 2013)</ref> During their investigation, they run into a girl with psionic powers named Sarah, her powers manifest into a being called Decay; she had been previously experimented on by the H.I.V.E.<ref>''Superboy'' #21 (August 2013)</ref>\n\nHe later appears in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #11, where he is on the Metropolis prison talking with [[Psimon]]. Then he appears in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #13, where he is trying to get [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s powers, but he accidentally looks into her mind, where he sees her killing him.\n\nLater during the \"[[Trinity War]]\" storyline, [[Question (comics)|Question]] gives Superman a newspaper clipping stating that Doctor Psycho was sighted in [[Khandaq]] the day when [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] was killed. This causes Superman, Question, and the Justice League to go after Doctor Psycho.<ref name=\"Justice League Dark #22\">''Justice League Dark'' #22</ref> Superman, Question, and the others arrive in Pittsburgh to confront Doctor Psycho. Martian Manhunter looks into Doctor Psycho's mind and learns that he was sent to Kahndaq by the Secret Society, but did not do anything to control Superman's mind.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, Doctor Psycho is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref name=\"Justice League Dark #22\"/> Then he appears in ''Justice League'' vol. 2 #29, where he is sent by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], along with the [[Fearsome Five]] and [[Hector Hammond]], to fight against [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the [[Metal Men]]. He ends up being defeated by Gold.\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nAfter the events of ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Doctor Psycho's history had been altered. Using his illusions to pose as a scientist for [[A.R.G.U.S.]] named Dr. Edward Carne, Doctor Psycho was first seen after [[Silver Swan (comics)|Vanessa Kapatelis]] was defeated and brought into custody by Wonder Woman. As Doctor Carne, Psycho told Wonder Woman that when Vanessa woke from her comatose state that he would be there for her.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #40 (April 2018)</ref>\n\nLater, Doctor Psycho was one of several powerful psychics kidnapped by [[Amanda Waller]] to hack into [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s mind.<ref>''Justice League: No Justice'' #1 (2018)</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Doctor Psycho is among the villains that attend an underground meeting held by the [[Riddler]], where they talk about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPsycho is a skilled occultist, and uses [[psionic]] powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] appearances, he was a hypnotist skilled in the occult who used his victims to draw ectoplasm into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn ''The New 52'' continuity, Doctor Psycho possesses psychic abilities including the regular telepathy, mind control, astral projection, telekinesis, levitation, projecting destructive blasts of psionic energy and creating psionic energy constructs such as armor, although Edgar has stated that he possesses every psionic power imaginable. However, he does not have the energy required to use his abilities to their fullest. He can overcome this weakness by siphoning mental energies from other individuals with psionic powers such as Superboy.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Wonder Woman '77===\nDoctor Psycho appears in the second story from ''[[Wonder Woman '77]]'', a series based on the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman TV series]], though he did not have any appearances in that television series. The doctor escapes a mental institution and abducts Wonder Woman. Using his telepathic machines, Doctor Psycho convinces Diana that she is no longer Wonder Woman. The superheroine escapes his mental labyrinth and defeats Doctor Psycho and his illusions, returning him to the mental institution.<ref>''Wonder Woman '77 Special'' #1 (2015)</ref>\n\n===Wonder Woman: Earth One===\nDoctor Psycho appears as a primary antagonist in the second volume of ''[[Wonder Woman: Earth One]]'' by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Yanick Paquette]]. This version of the character is Dr. Leon Zeiko, a pick-up artist who manipulates Wonder Woman.\n\n===Gods and Monsters===\nDoctor Psycho appears in the tie-in comics of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'' under the identity of '''Dr. Jackson Alpert''', who's working for a [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] project called [[MKUltra]], where they used psychotropic drugs to experiment on human beings without their knowledge or permission, all because they wanted to control people. But Alpert wanted to set them free, bring them to the next level of evolution. Because of this disagreement, he left the C.I.A. project and joined the \"Hairies\" on The Farm in New York, where he conducted his experiments on people with the chemicals developed by him in his lab, but their experiments went awry, turning them into wild, violent creatures, disgusting [[Bekka]], the Wonder Woman. Thanks to Bekka's crystal gems created by her [[Mother Box]], Doctor Psycho advanced in his experiments, but his misrepresented goals turned people in his lab into monsters. Despite this he founded The Eternity Institute in [[Switzerland]] and all he'd achieved\u2014the extraordinary advances in science, medicine and technology\u2014over the next forty years Alpert became a notorious recluse, never being seen in public and secretly harvesting DNA of the [[Justice League]]. He was the one who created the [[Forever People]], claiming to be the result of his efforts to develop humanity and lead them to a new world of peace and order, devoting to wipe out disease, poverty and war. But beneath all a veneer of goodness and altruism lay the essence of a greedy man, and in his dying days, evolved into [[Imperiex]] using DNA of the League and the Forever Formula. He was defeated and Bekka beheaded the evil doctor with her sword.<ref>''Justice League: Gods and Monsters'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* \"Doctor Psycho\" is the title of the fourth episode of the fourth season of the TV series ''[[Orange is the New Black]]''.

The pitch also depends on its size.\n* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual.\n* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]].\n* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as how an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might voice a particular instrument or tune [[Voix c\u00e9leste|celeste]] ranks.\n\n===Universal components===\n====Bellows====\n{{Listen\n|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg\n|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds\n|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows\u2014949&nbsp;KB\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Squeeze boxes accordion bandoneon concertina diatonic chromatic.jpg|thumb|265px|'''Bellows-Driven Instruments'''\n<br>\nPiano accordions\uff65\uff65\uff651,2,13<br>\nDiatonic button accordion\uff65\uff65\uff653<br>\nChromatic button accordions\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,14<br>\nDigital accordions(V-Accordions, [[Roland Corporation]])\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,13,14<br>\n[[Bandoneon]]\uff65\uff65\uff654<br>\n[[English concertina]]\uff65\uff65\uff655<br>\n[[Anglo concertina|Anglo-German concertinas]](Anglo concertinas)\uff65\uff65\uff656,7,8,9,10]]\nThe [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.\n\nThe keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows.

These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n====Pallet mechanism====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion.

A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]\n\n===Variable components===\nThe term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n====Right-hand manual systems====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords). Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.\n**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.\n**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. \n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. \n\nPrice is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. \n\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n===Unusual accordions===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities \u2014 only a few have remained in use:\n* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol\n* The [[schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement \u2014  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass \u2013 that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia peda\u0142owa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}\n[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Eight-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]\n\nThe accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]], in 1822, by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],<ref group=\"notes\">There is not a single document to back up this belief.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w\u00fcrde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A\u2013Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : \u201cGREAT CONCERT-ROOM \u2013 KING\u2019S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called \u201ca concertina,\u201d an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': \u201cWhile we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>\n\nAfter Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.\n\n==Use in various music genres==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n===Use in traditional music===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nThe accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.  The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandone\u00f3n]] are related. The [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family, but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on a surface or the floor.\n\nThe accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.\n\nThe accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example Brazil,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blognejo.com.br/blognejo-informa/top-five-os-maiores-sanfoneiros-da-musica-sertaneja-atual|title=TOP FIVE \u2013 OS MAIORES SANFONEIROS DA M\u00daSICA SERTANEJA ATUAL \u2013 Blognejo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://divirta-se.uai.com.br/app/noticia/musica/2013/05/22/noticia_musica,142451/o-dono-da-festa.shtml|title=Novo disco de Michel Tel\u00f3 junta sanfona, m\u00fasica sertaneja, eletr\u00f4nica e ritmos dan\u00e7antes|work=Divirta-se \u2013 Tudo sobre entretenimento, cinema, shows, celebridades e promo\u00e7\u00f5es}}</ref> Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama) it is used in popular music (for example Gaucho, [[Forr\u00f3]] and [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] in Brazil, [[Vallenato]] in Colombia, and [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] in Mexico), whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends to be more used for [[dance-pop]] and [[folk music]] and is often used in folk music in Europe, North America and South America. In Europe and North America, [[Accordion#Use in popular music|some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is used in [[Cajun music|cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[jazz music]] and in both solo and orchestral performances of [[classical music]].\nThe [[piano accordion]] is the official city instrument of [[San Francisco]], California.<ref>{{cite news|title=City Makes Accordion San Francisco's Official Instrument|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/City-Makes-Accordion-San-Francisco-s-Official-Instrument/id-376dd5a7b608f64b18abf834aaafc0fd|accessdate=24 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=24 April 1990}}</ref>   Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments.  The oldest name for this group of instruments is ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning \"harmonic, musical\". Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned \"automatically coupled chords on the bass side\".<ref>Dyremose, Jeanette & Lars, ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (2003), p.133</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Spirk.ogv|thumb|right|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played]]\nAccordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:\n* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement.\n* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size.\n* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual.\n* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]].\n* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as how an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might voice a particular instrument or tune [[Voix c\u00e9leste|celeste]] ranks.\n\n===Universal components===\n====Bellows====\n{{Listen\n|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg\n|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds\n|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows\u2014949&nbsp;KB\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Squeeze boxes accordion bandoneon concertina diatonic chromatic.jpg|thumb|265px|'''Bellows-Driven Instruments'''\n<br>\nPiano accordions\uff65\uff65\uff651,2,13<br>\nDiatonic button accordion\uff65\uff65\uff653<br>\nChromatic button accordions\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,14<br>\nDigital accordions(V-Accordions, [[Roland Corporation]])\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,13,14<br>\n[[Bandoneon]]\uff65\uff65\uff654<br>\n[[English concertina]]\uff65\uff65\uff655<br>\n[[Anglo concertina|Anglo-German concertinas]](Anglo concertinas)\uff65\uff65\uff656,7,8,9,10]]\nThe [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.\n\nThe keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows. Bellows effects include:\n* Volume control, including swells  and fades\n* Repeated short, rapid changes of direction (\"bellows shake\"), which has been popularized by musicians such as Renato Borghete (gaucho music) and [[Luiz Gonzaga]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340 |title= Luiz Gonzaga:Biography by John Dougan |first=John |last=Dougan |website=All Music |publisher=RhythmOne group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130122258/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340/biography |archive-date=30 November 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> and extensively used in [[Forr\u00f3]], called ''resfulengo'' in Brazil\n* Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals\n* Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance\n* Subtly changing the intonation to mimic the expressiveness of a singer\n* Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving (\"whooshing\"), which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions for this instrument\n\n====Body====\n[[File:Petosa - showroom 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Petosa accordion shop showroom.]]\nThe accordion's body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n====Pallet mechanism====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]\n\n===Variable components===\nThe term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n====Right-hand manual systems====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords). Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.\n**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.\n**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. \n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. \n\nPrice is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. \n\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n===Unusual accordions===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities \u2014 only a few have remained in use:\n* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol\n* The [[schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement \u2014  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass \u2013 that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia peda\u0142owa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}\n[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Eight-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]\n\nThe accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]], in 1822, by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],<ref group=\"notes\">There is not a single document to back up this belief.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w\u00fcrde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A-Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : \u201cGREAT CONCERT-ROOM \u2013 KING\u2019S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called \u201ca concertina,\u201d an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': \u201cWhile we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>\n\nAfter Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.\n\n==Use in various music genres==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n===Use in traditional music===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nThe accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

Accordion is also used in the music of the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].\n\nAccordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. The Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist. One of their accordionists, Netta Skog, is now a member of [[Ensiferum]], another folk-metal band. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist.

This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country (in the Forr\u00f3 Universit\u00e1rio genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music. It is an important instrument in [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the midwest and southeast of Brazil, and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country.\n\n===Colombia===\nThe accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andr\u00e9s Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as rock musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, who emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, and have come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nEvery year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the \"King of Kings\" accordion competition takes place, where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the ''Pilonera Mayor'' prize.<ref>Smithsonian Channel, [https://archive.is/20130630080628/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 \"The Accordion Kings\"], 15 August 2010.</ref> This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.\n\n===Mexico===\n[[File:Tijuana-performers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Norte\u00f1o band, including an accordion]]\n[[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]] heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to polka.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

The Secret Service also provides physical security for the [[White House|White House Complex]], the neighboring [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] building, the [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]], and all foreign diplomatic missions in [[Washington, D.C.]] The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local [[law enforcement]], protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as [[National Special Security Event|National Special Security Events (NSSE)]]. As part of the Service's mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on meticulous advance work and threat assessments developed by its Intelligence Division to identify potential risks to protectees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/|title=United States Secret Service: Protective Mission|publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Investigative mission===\nSafeguards the payment and [[financial systems]] of the [[United States]] from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes. Financial investigations include [[counterfeit]] US currency, bank and financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Electronic investigations include [[cybercrime]], network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is also a member of the [[FBI]]'s [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. Also, the Secret Service investigates missing and exploited children and is a partner of the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] (NCMEC).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/investigation/|title=United States Secret Service: Investigative Mission |publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate the [[counterfeiting]] of US currency, which was rampant following the [[American Civil War]]. The agency then evolved into the [[United States]]' first domestic intelligence and [[counterintelligence]] agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), and [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]] (IRS-CI).\n\n==Dual objective==\n[[File:Secret Service agents conducting investigations.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents conducting electronic investigations]]\n[[File:US Secret Service Agent.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents protecting [[President George W.

After the 1901 [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of President William McKinley]], [[Congress]] also directed the Secret Service to protect the [[president of the United States]].\n\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:<ref name=\"ProtectionLaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3056-|title=United States Code: Title 18, Section 3056}}</ref>\n* The president, [[vice president]] (or other officer next in the order of succession to the [[Office of President]], should the vice presidency be vacant), president-elect and [[vice president]]\u2013-elect\n* The immediate families of the above individuals\n* Former presidents and their spouses for their lifetimes (except when the spouse divorces or remarries), under the [[Former Presidents Act]].

The agency's key focus is on large, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups. Financial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at automatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that commit bank fraud on a global scale.\n\nThe USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law enforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The Service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes.

The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began investigating a wide range of crimes from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling.\n\nAfter the [[William McKinley assassination|assassination]] of President [[William McKinley]] in 1901, [[United States Congress|Congress]] informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection.

Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.<ref name=\"USSS\"/>\n\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GS-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\n\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/availability-pay|title=LEAP Pay}}</ref> Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York City area will earn an annual salary of approximately $78,961 (GL-09), $92,452 (GS-11), $110,813 (GS-12), $131,771 (GS-13), $155,713 (GS-14), and $170,800 (GS-15).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2018/law-enforcement-officer-salary-calculator|title=LEAP Salary Calculator}}</ref>\n\nMoreover due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (in addition to LEAP), and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap of $197,300 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to $170,800 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/837/1 |title=Secret Service Agent Overtime Pay}}</ref>\n\n===Uniformed Division Officer===\n{{Main|United States Secret Service Uniformed Division}}\n[[File:Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT).png|thumb|Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT)]]\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a [[security police]] similar to the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] or [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|DHS Federal Protective Service]] and is in charge of protecting the physical [[White House]] grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Established in 1922 as the [[White House Police Force|White House Police]], this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930.

Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\n\nAssignments may include:\n* Maintaining designated protective security posts that control movement of persons into and around multiple Secret Service facilities and associated areas\n* Inspecting all operational, safety, emergency, and convenience equipment of protective vehicles to ensure peak-operating condition\n* Driving protective or follow-up vehicles\n* Monitoring and operating various communications equipment\n* Using various advanced x-ray screening technologies to detect and identify high-risk items\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \"special officer\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \"Deputy US Marshal\".\n\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete nine (9) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J.

In addition to the 1911A1, from the 1930s through the 1960s, Special Agents often carried the [[Colt Detective Special]] and - upon its release in 1950 - the [[Smith & Wesson Model 36]] .38-Special revolvers.\n\nFollowing the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, along with the growing trend of [[.357 Magnum]] revolvers being issued to law enforcement, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum [[Smith & Wesson Model 19]] revolver; often the 2.5-inch barreled model for ease of concealment. Between 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service also issued the Smith & Wesson Model 66 revolver, a stainless variant of the Model 19 with anywhere from the 2.5-inch to 4-inch-barrel and loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]]. In 1992, as law enforcement nationwide phased out revolvers in favor of higher-capacity [[semi-automatic pistol]]s, the standard-issue handgun became the [[SIG Sauer P226#P228|SIG Sauer P228]] 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service from 1992 to 1999.\n\nThe Secret Service replaced the [[Thompson submachine gun]] often used by federal law enforcement in  the [[Prohibition Era]] with the [[Colt AR-15]] rifle for long-range protection, along with the [[Uzi]] submachine gun for more concealable firepower in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. Uzis used by the Secret Service had slightly shorter-than-standard barrels so they could to fit inside the standard size [[Samsonite]] briefcases that concealed them. This setup was famously deployed by Special Agent Robert Wanko during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. The agency, like many others, phased out the Uzi in the 1990s and replaced it with the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|H&K MP5]] submachine gun. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi. The [[Secret Service Counter Assault Team|Counter Assault Team]] used the [[M4 carbine]] from the early 1990s until 2006.\n\n===Current weapons===\nAgents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the [[FN P90]] submachine gun, the 9mm [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] submachine gun, and the 12-gauge [[Remington 870]] [[shotgun]].<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically, Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/1478513/new-us-secret-service-lapel-pins-will-come-with-a-secret-security-feature/|title=New US Secret Service lapel pins will come with a secret security feature|publisher=Quartz.com|date=November 30, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the counter-sniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers.

The Secret Service also provides physical security for the [[White House|White House Complex]], the neighboring [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] building, the [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]], and all foreign diplomatic missions in [[Washington, D.C.]] The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local [[law enforcement]], protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as [[National Special Security Event|National Special Security Events (NSSE)]]. As part of the Service's mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on meticulous advance work and threat assessments developed by its [[Intelligence Division]] to identify potential risks to protectees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/|title=United States Secret Service: Protective Mission|publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Investigative mission===\nSafeguards the payment and [[financial systems]] of the [[United States]] from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes. Financial investigations include [[counterfeit]] US currency, bank and financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Electronic investigations include [[cybercrime]], network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is also a member of the [[FBI]]'s [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. Also, the Secret Service investigates missing and exploited children and is a partner of the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] (NCMEC).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/investigation/|title=United States Secret Service: Investigative Mission |publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate the [[counterfeiting]] of US currency, which was rampant following the [[American Civil War]]. The agency then evolved into the [[United States]]' first domestic intelligence and [[counterintelligence]] agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), and [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]] (IRS-CI).\n\n==Dual objective==\n[[File:Secret Service agents conducting investigations.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents conducting electronic investigations]]\n[[File:US Secret Service Agent.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents protecting [[President George W.

The two core missions of protection and investigations synergize with the other, providing crucial benefits to special agents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course of investigations which are also used in an agent\u2019s protective duties include but are not limited to: \n* Partnerships that are created between field offices and local law enforcement during the course of investigations being used to gather both protective intelligence and in coordinating protection events.\n* [[Tactical operation]] (e.g. surveillance, arrests, and search warrants) and law enforcement writing (e.g. affidavits, after action reports, and operations plans) skills being applied to both investigative and protective duties.\n* Proficiency in analyzing handwriting and forgery techniques being applied in protective investigations of handwritten letters and suspicious package threats.\n* Expertise in investigating electronic and financial crimes being applied in protective investigations of threats made against the nation's leaders on the [[Internet]].\n\nProtection of the nation's highest elected leaders and other government officials is one of the primary missions of the Secret Service. After the 1901 [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of President William McKinley]], [[Congress]] also directed the Secret Service to protect the [[president of the United States]].\n\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:<ref name=\"ProtectionLaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3056-|title=United States Code: Title 18, Section 3056}}</ref>\n* The president, [[vice president]] (or other officer next in the order of succession to the [[Office of President]], should the vice presidency be vacant), president-elect and [[vice president]]\u2013-elect\n* The immediate families of the above individuals\n* Former presidents and their spouses for their lifetimes (except when the spouse divorces or remarries), under the [[Former Presidents Act]].

The Service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes.

The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began investigating a wide range of crimes from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling.\n\nAfter the [[William McKinley assassination|assassination]] of President [[William McKinley]] in 1901, [[United States Congress|Congress]] informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection.

Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.<ref name=\"USSS\"/>\n\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GS-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\n\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/availability-pay|title=LEAP Pay}}</ref> Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York City area will earn an annual salary of approximately $78,961 (GL-09), $92,452 (GS-11), $110,813 (GS-12), $131,771 (GS-13), $155,713 (GS-14), and $170,800 (GS-15).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2018/law-enforcement-officer-salary-calculator|title=LEAP Salary Calculator}}</ref>\n\nMoreover due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (in addition to LEAP), and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap of $197,300 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to $170,800 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/837/1 |title=Secret Service Agent Overtime Pay}}</ref>\n\n===Uniformed Division Officer===\n{{Main|United States Secret Service Uniformed Division}}\n[[File:Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT).png|thumb|Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT)]]\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a [[security police]] similar to the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] or [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|DHS Federal Protective Service]] and is in charge of protecting the physical [[White House]] grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Established in 1922 as the [[White House Police Force|White House Police]], this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\n\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the vice president's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions.<ref name=\"Uniformed\"/> Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\n* Canine Unit: Performing security sweeps and responding to bomb threats and suspicious packages.\n* Emergency Response Team: Providing a coordinated tactical response for the White House and other protected facilities.\n* Counter-sniper Team: Utilizing observation, sighting equipment and high-performance weapons to provide a secure environment for protectees.\n* Motorcade Support Unit: Providing motorcycle tactical support for official movements of motorcades.\n* Crime Scene Search Unit: Photographing, collecting and processing physical and latent evidence.\n* Office of Training: Serving as firearms and classroom instructors or recruiters.\n* Special Operations Section: Handling special duties and functions at the White House Complex, including conducting the daily congressional and public tours of the White House.<ref name=\"Uniformed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/join/careers/uniformed|title=Uniformed Division Careers}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Special Officer===\nSecret Service special officers (not to be confused with Uniformed Division Officers) are federal agents who work within the Special Agent Division and perform a wide range of security functions and support assignments as part of the protective mission for the Secret Service. Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\n\nAssignments may include:\n* Maintaining designated protective security posts that control movement of persons into and around multiple Secret Service facilities and associated areas\n* Inspecting all operational, safety, emergency, and convenience equipment of protective vehicles to ensure peak-operating condition\n* Driving protective or follow-up vehicles\n* Monitoring and operating various communications equipment\n* Using various advanced x-ray screening technologies to detect and identify high-risk items\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \"special officer\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \"Deputy US Marshal\".\n\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete nine (9) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.\n\n===Investigative Protection Officer===\nInvestigative Protection Officer \"IPO\" is a new title reclassification of the Special Officer position.

In the 1930s, agents often carried [[Colt M1911A1]] pistols in [[.45 ACP]] caliber. In addition to the 1911A1, from the 1930s through the 1960s, Special Agents often carried the [[Colt Detective Special]] and - upon its release in 1950 - the [[Smith & Wesson Model 36]] .38-Special revolvers.\n\nFollowing the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, along with the growing trend of [[.357 Magnum]] revolvers being issued to law enforcement, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum [[Smith & Wesson Model 19]] revolver; often the 2.5-inch barreled model for ease of concealment. Between 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service also issued the Smith & Wesson Model 66 revolver, a stainless variant of the Model 19 with anywhere from the 2.5-inch to 4-inch-barrel and loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]]. In 1992, as law enforcement nationwide phased out revolvers in favor of higher-capacity [[semi-automatic pistol]]s, the standard-issue handgun became the [[SIG Sauer P226#P228|SIG Sauer P228]] 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service from 1992 to 1999.\n\nThe Secret Service replaced the [[Thompson submachine gun]] often used by federal law enforcement in  the [[Prohibition Era]] with the [[Colt AR-15]] rifle for long-range protection, along with the [[Uzi]] submachine gun for more concealable firepower in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively.

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. Siloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

See the chemical equations on pp.&nbsp;3-4.</ref> : \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|CO|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\nHowever, not all Na or K soluble salts can precipitate insoluble calcium salts, such as, ''e.g.'', NaCl-based deicing salts: \n\n: 2 {{chem|Na|Cl}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2190 {{chem|Ca|Cl|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nAs calcium chloride is a soluble salt, the reaction cannot occur and the chemical equilibrium regresses to the left side of the reaction. \n\nSo, a question arises: can NaCl or KCl from deicing salts still possibly play a role in the alkali-silica reaction? {{chem|Na|+}} and {{chem|K|+}} cations in themselves cannot attack silica (the culprit is their counter ion {{chem|OH|-}}) and soluble alkali chlorides cannot produce soluble alkali hydroxide by interacting with calcium hydroxide. So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste) and calcium sulfo-aluminate (AFm and AFt, [[ettringite]]). Calcium-rich C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) and are expected to play the same role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (written here in ancient industrial silicate notation): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected agregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous C-S-H can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate. So, the use of limestone as aggregate is not a guarantee against ASR in itself.\n# Add very fine siliceous materials to neutralize the excessive [[alkalinity]] of cement with [[silicic acid]] by deliberately provoking a controlled [[pozzolanic reaction]] at the early stage of the cement setting. Convenient pozzolanic materials to add to the mix may be, ''e.g.'', [[pozzolan]], [[silica fume]], [[fly ash]], or [[metakaolin]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Ramlochan\n| first = Terrence\n|author2=Michael Thomas |author3=Karen A.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1>EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\u201dEN_206\u201d>NBN EN 206:2013+A1:2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. Siloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste) and calcium sulfo-aluminate (AFm and AFt, [[ettringite]]). Calcium-rich C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) and are expected to play the same role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (written here in ancient industrial silicate notation): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected agregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous C-S-H can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

Convenient pozzolanic materials to add to the mix may be, ''e.g.'', [[pozzolan]], [[silica fume]], [[fly ash]], or [[metakaolin]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Ramlochan\n| first = Terrence\n|author2=Michael Thomas |author3=Karen A.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1>EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\u201dEN_206\u201d>NBN EN 206:2013+A1: 2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''
