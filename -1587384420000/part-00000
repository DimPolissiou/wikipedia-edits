In March 1923 he signed the [[Treaty of Ni\u0161 (1923)|Treaty of Ni\u0161]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO and IWORO carried out from Bulgarian territory.<ref>{{cite book |title= World War One|last=Roberts |first=Priscilla Mary |authorlink= |coauthors=|quote=On 23 March 1923 Stamboliyski signed the convention of Nish with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).

The fall of the pro-Yugoslav government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski was a great success to the power of  IMRO.

IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it.

After preliminary experiments, a [[.416 Rigby]] case necked down to take a {{convert|0.338|in|mm|adj=on}} [[bullet]] was selected, since this diameter presents an optimum of [[sectional density]] and [[Penetration (weapons)|penetrating capability]] for practical spin-stabilized rifle bullets (bullets up to about 5 to 5.5 calibers in length).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719055931/http://lutz-moeller-jagd.de/PDF/Kneubuehl.pdf What is the Maximum Length of a spin stabilized Projectile? by Mr. Beat Kneub\u00fchl].</ref>\n\nThe .416 Rigby is an English big game cartridge that was designed in 1911 to accommodate 325&nbsp;MPa (47,137&nbsp;psi) pressures. One of the disadvantages of these old cartridge cases, which were intended for firing [[cordite]] charges instead of modern [[smokeless powder]], is the thickness of the sidewall just forward of the web. During ignition, the cartridge's base, just forward of the bolt face, is not supported.\n\nDuring the process RAI employed Jim Bell and Brass Extrusion Labs Ltd. (B.E.L.L.) of Bensenville, Illinois, to make the '''.338/416''' or '''8.58\u00d771mm''' cartridge cases, [[Hornady]] produced bullets, and RAI built a sniper rifle under contract for the U.S. Navy. RAI found that the BELL cases did not fulfill the requirements, since they were modified low pressure .416 Rigby cases. Pressed by military deadlines RAI looked for another case producer and contacted Lapua of Finland in 1984.<ref>[http://www.lapua.com/index.php?id=1116Nammo Lapua Oy company website]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.</ref> RAI was forced to drop out of the program due to financial difficulties.

McPherson, DBI Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-87349-178-5}}.</ref> The .338/416 rifle program was later canceled when the contractors were unable to make the cartridge meet the project's velocity target of {{convert|914|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|16.2|g|gr|abbr=on}} bullet, due to excessive pressures rupturing cartridge cases.\n\n===Final development===\nThe current .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge was developed as a joint venture between the Finnish rifle manufacturer [[SAKO]] and the British rifle manufacturer [[Accuracy International]] along with the Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua, or more officially Nammo Lapua Oy, which since 1998 is part of the [[Nammo|Nordic Ammunition Group (Nammo)]].<ref>{{cite web |title=From an American dream to a Finnish success story |url=http://www.lapua.com/index.php?id=889 |website= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430114500/http://www.lapua.com/index.php?id=889 |archivedate=2008-04-30 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2009-05-16 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|title=History of Lapua - About us - Nammo Lapua|work=lapua.com|accessdate=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122071902/http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|archive-date=2018-01-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLapua opted to redesign the .338/416 cartridge. In the new case design, particular attention was directed toward thickening and metallurgically strengthening the case's web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. In modern solid head cases, the hardness of the brass is the major factor that determines a case's pressure limit before undergoing [[plastic deformation]]. Lapua tackled this problem by creating a hardness distribution ranging from the head and web (hard) to the mouth (soft) as well as a strengthened (thicker) case web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. This resulted in a very pressure resistant case, allowing it to operate at high pressure and come within 15&nbsp;m/s (50&nbsp;ft/s) of the original velocity goal.\nLapua also designed a {{convert|16.2|g|gr|adj=on}} .338 calibre Lock Base B408 [[full metal jacket bullet]], modeled after its .30 calibre Lock Base bullet configuration.\nThe result was the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge which was registered with [[C.I.P.]] ([[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives]]) in 1989. With the procurement by the [[Dutch Army]], the cartridge became NATO codified.\n\nThe .338 Lapua Magnum fills the gap between weapons chambered for standard military rounds such as the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] and large, heavy rifles firing the [[.50 BMG]] cartridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm|title=Cartridges for Long|work=quarryhs.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527062842/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm|archive-date=27 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It also offers an acceptable amount of barrel wear, which is important to military snipers who tend to fire thousands of rounds a year in practice. This was achieved by coupling a sensible case volume (7.40 ml) to bore area (56.86&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>/0.5686&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) [[overbore|ratio]] (13.01 O<sub>ratio</sub>) with ample space for loading relatively long slender projectiles that can provide good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the projectile diameter.<ref group=\"notes\">The Finnish Army found out during a test/trails program and 7 years of service that the barrels of their Sako [[TRG-42]] sniper rifles lasted 7,000 to 8,000 rounds with Lapua Lock Base B408 factory ammunition before showing impermissible accuracy decay. The Finnish Army consistent accuracy requirement for these rifles is \u2264 1 [[Minute of arc|MOA]] at 1,000 m. If this requirement is not met the TRG-42 gets a new barrel. This is normal practice for active high performance precision rifle operators who regard barrels as expendable items. The continuous use of very powerful [[handloading|handloads]] (which results in higher muzzle velocities) resulted in much quicker throat erosion reducing the TRG-42 barrel's accuracy life to 1500 to 2000 rounds.</ref> Like every other comparable large magnum rifle cartridge, the .338 Lapua Magnum presents a stout [[free recoil|recoil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accuratereloading.com/recoil.html|title=RECOIL|work=accuratereloading.com|accessdate=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027205130/http://www.accuratereloading.com/recoil.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> An appropriate fitting [[Stock (firearm)|stock]] and an effective [[muzzle brake]] helps to reduce recoil-induced problems, enabling the operator to fire more rounds before getting too uncomfortable to shoot accurately.

This means that .338 Lapua Magnum chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at {{convert|525.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} PE piezo pressure.\n\nLapua has been ambivalent on the maximum piezo pressure of this cartridge.

Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using high pressure loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.\n\nThe American [[.338-378 Weatherby Magnum]] cartridge introduced in 1998 and the American [[.338 Remington Ultra Magnum]] (.338 RUM) cartridge introduced in 2000 are probably the closest ballistic twins of the .338 Lapua Magnum commercially available {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum is however a [[Rim (firearms)|belted]] cartridge and the .338 Remington Ultra Magnum is a [[Rim (firearms)|rebated rim]] cartridge.\n\nThe American [[SAAMI]] (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute) has no normal voluntary guidelines for the .338 Lapua Magnum. On 14 January 2013 it opted to use the metric C.I.P. rulings and add some dimensions that have no C.I.P. analog.<ref>[https://saami.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ANSI-SAAMI-Z299.4-CFR-Approved-2015-12-14-Posting-Copy.pdf SAAMI Maximum Cartridge / Minimum Chamber drawing (METRIC) 338 Lapua Magnum, page 116]</ref>\n\n==Supersonic range performance of the .338 Lapua Magnum==\n\n===Performance with C.I.P. conforming cartridges===\nFor a typical .338 Lapua Magnum high end factory military sniper rifle like the Sako [[TRG-42]] with a {{convert|690|mm|1|abbr=on}} long 305&nbsp;mm (1 in 12&nbsp;inch) rifling twist rate barrel at sea level, {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} is considered to be the maximum shooting distance for man sized targets. When using standard Lapua military 16.2&nbsp;g (250&nbsp;gr) loads it has a supersonic range of {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} under warm summer conditions at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|915|m/s|abbr=on}}. However, to be able to maintain 80 to 90% hit probability on non-moving {{convert|45|x|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} reactive army targets, this maximum shooting distance has to be reduced to {{convert|1300|m|yd|0}} at freezing point conditions or {{convert|1100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in Arctic winter conditions, when the muzzle velocity may drop to {{convert|880|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\u2014i.e. only during optimal warm summer conditions the {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} maximum shooting distance is realistically achievable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC116_2_300_338_Rev1.pdf|title=Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) Analysis of the Optimized 300 Winchester Magnum vs 338 Lapua Magnum With Various Ammunition Types by Bryan Litz, Applied Ballistics LLC|access-date=2014-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172716/http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC116_2_300_338_Rev1.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC115_ProbabalisticWEZ.pdf|title=Probabalistic Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) Analysis A Conceptual Overview by Bryan Litz|access-date=2014-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172715/http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC115_ProbabalisticWEZ.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLoaded with more aerodynamic [[very-low-drag bullet]]s such as the traditionally lead cored 19.44 g (300.0 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet ([[ballistic coefficient|G1 BC]] = 0.736) or the Lost River Ballistics J40 .338 17.5&nbsp;gram (270 gr) CNC manufactured mono-metal bullet (G1 BC = 0.871) the long-range performance and supersonic range of .338 Lapua Magnum rifles can be improved. These longer very-low-drag bullets require a 254&nbsp;mm (1 in 10&nbsp;inch) twist rate to stabilize them. Due to the lower practically possible muzzle velocities for a relative heavy bullet like the 19.44 g (300 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet it gains about {{convert|104|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} extra supersonic range under [[International Standard Atmosphere]] sea level conditions ([[air density]] \u03c1 = 1.225&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>) at a muzzle velocity of 837&nbsp;m/s (2750&nbsp;ft/s) when compared to the standard 16.2 g (250 gr) Lapua Scenar GB488 VLD at a muzzle velocity of 915&nbsp;m/s (3002&nbsp;ft/s). For significant supersonic range improvement the aerodynamic efficiency of the employed bullets has to be significantly improved without sacrificing a lot of practically achievable muzzle velocity - meaning that besides the [[coefficient of drag]] of the projectile weight is also an important parameter for its actual downrange flight behavior. The .338 17.5&nbsp;gram (270 gr) Lost River Ballistic Technologies J40 match bullet made out of a copper-nickel alloy is one of the most aerodynamic .338 calibre bullets available. It has an {{convert|1800|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} supersonic range under optimal warm summer conditions at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|869|m/s|abbr=on}}. This makes engaging static targets up to {{convert|1800|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} feasible.\n\n===Performance improvement experiments with non-C.I.P.-conforming cartridges===\nImprovement beyond this standard while still using standard .338 Lapua Magnum brass is possible, but the bullets have to be very long (over 5.5 calibers in length) and the normal cartridge overall length of 93.5&nbsp;mm has to be exceeded making such cartridges [[Wildcat cartridge|wildcats]]. The common 254&nbsp;mm (1:10&nbsp;inch) rifling twist rate also has to be tightened to stabilize very long projectiles. Such commercially non-existent cartridges are termed [[Wildcat cartridge|\"wildcats\"]]. The use of a wildcat .338 Lapua Magnum based cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and fast-twist bore. The [[firearm action]] and if a repeating arm is required the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine(s)]] must also be able to cope with dimensional increases.\n\nAn example of such a special .338 calibre extreme range bullet is the German CNC manufactured mono-metal 18.92&nbsp;gram (292 gr) [[Very-low-drag bullet#Modern design|LM-105]] (C<sub>d</sub> = 0.2487 at [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.216 \u2013 this [[drag coefficient]] and the corresponding G1, G7 and G8 ballistic coefficients are established by [[Doppler radar]] [[External ballistics#Doppler radar-measurements|measurements]]).<ref name=\"lutzmoeller\">{{cite web |url=http://lutzmoeller.net/English/LM-105-long-range-bullet.php#LM_105_Radar_Data |title=LM-105 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209102339/http://lutzmoeller.net/English/LM-105-long-range-bullet.php#LM_105_Radar_Data |archivedate=February 9, 2014 }}</ref> The LM-105 has a supersonic range of \u2248 {{convert|1860|m|yd|-1}} at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|915|m/s|ft/s|0}} under [[International Standard Atmosphere]] sea level conditions ([[air density]] \u03c1 = 1.225&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>).

The 19.3 g (298 gr) LM-107 projectile design is {{convert|59|mm|in|}} long and has a Haack profiled nose and an Adams profiled tail. The [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for the .343 Lapua Magnum LM-107 wildcat cartridge was chosen at 180&nbsp;mm (1:7&nbsp;inch), \u00d8 lands = 8.72&nbsp;mm, \u00d8 grooves = 8.45&nbsp;mm and loaded with the LM-107 projectile has a cartridge overall length of {{convert|107|mm|in}}. The length of the neck is increased from 8,31 to 8,50&nbsp;mm to support the bigger LM-107 bullet. Several other dimensions of the .338 Lapua Magnum parental cartridge are also changed. The shoulder angle gets steepened from 40\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and the body taper is set at 1\u00b0. The throat area is set at a 2\u00b0 cone-angle. All this modifications make the .343 Lapua Magnum a fairly comprehensively revised wildcat cartridge. Out of a {{convert|900|mm|in|1}} long progressive twist barrel Mr. M\u00f6ller expected to achieve {{convert|909|m/s|ft/s|0}} muzzle velocity.

The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter [[bullet]]s result in very high muzzle velocities.\n\nThe Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua got the .300 Lapua Magnum C.I.P. certified, so it became an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish \"family\" of super magnum rifle cartridges. The .300 Lapua Magnum is not commercially available and currently exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 calibre bullets.\n\nThe .300 Lapua Magnum has a 7.33 [[litre|ml]] (113 [[grain (measure)|grains]] H<sub>2</sub>O) cartridge case capacity.\n\n[[File:.300 Lapua Magnum.svg|400px]]\n\n'''.300 Lapua Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions.'''

The large boltface combined with the high 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) maximum pressure makes that the .300 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large and fierce cartridges and thus high bolt thrust safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.\n\n===The 7.62 UKM===\nThe .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge is also used as the parent case for the German designed [[7.62 UKM]], which is essentially a necked-down shortened version of the .338 Lapua Magnum.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/ma/ZERMEL/762ukm.html The 7.62 UKM.

Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as [[Wildcat cartridge|wildcats]]. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the .338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times, it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters.

After preliminary experiments, a [[.416 Rigby]] case necked down to take a {{convert|0.338|in|mm|adj=on}} [[bullet]] was selected, since this diameter presents an optimum of [[sectional density]] and [[Penetration (weapons)|penetrating capability]] for practical spin-stabilized rifle bullets (bullets up to about 5 to 5.5 calibers in length).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719055931/http://lutz-moeller-jagd.de/PDF/Kneubuehl.pdf What is the Maximum Length of a spin stabilized Projectile? by Mr. Beat Kneub\u00fchl].</ref>\n\nThe .416 Rigby is an English big game cartridge that was designed in 1911 to accommodate 325&nbsp;MPa (47,137&nbsp;psi) pressures. One of the disadvantages of these old cartridge cases, which were intended for firing [[cordite]] charges instead of modern [[smokeless powder]], is the thickness of the sidewall just forward of the web. During ignition, the cartridge's base, just forward of the bolt face, is not supported.\n\nDuring the process RAI employed Jim Bell and Brass Extrusion Labs Ltd. (B.E.L.L.) of Bensenville, Illinois, to make the '''.338/416''' or '''8.58\u00d771mm''' cartridge cases, [[Hornady]] produced bullets, and RAI built a sniper rifle under contract for the U.S. Navy. RAI found that the BELL cases did not fulfill the requirements, since they were modified low pressure .416 Rigby cases. Pressed by military deadlines RAI looked for another case producer and contacted Lapua of Finland in 1984.<ref>[http://www.lapua.com/index.php?id=1116Nammo Lapua Oy company website]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.</ref> RAI was forced to drop out of the program due to financial difficulties.

In the new case design, particular attention was directed toward thickening and metallurgically strengthening the case's web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. In modern solid head cases, the hardness of the brass is the major factor that determines a case's pressure limit before undergoing [[plastic deformation]]. Lapua tackled this problem by creating a hardness distribution ranging from the head and web (hard) to the mouth (soft) as well as a strengthened (thicker) case web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. This resulted in a very pressure resistant case, allowing it to operate at high pressure and come within 15&nbsp;m/s (50&nbsp;ft/s) of the original velocity goal.\nLapua also designed a {{convert|16.2|g|gr|adj=on}} .338 calibre Lock Base B408 [[full metal jacket bullet]], modeled after its .30 calibre Lock Base bullet configuration.\nThe result was the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge which was registered with [[C.I.P.]] ([[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives]]) in 1989. With the procurement by the [[Dutch Army]], the cartridge became NATO codified.\n\nThe .338 Lapua Magnum fills the gap between weapons chambered for standard military rounds such as the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] and large, heavy rifles firing the [[.50 BMG]] cartridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm|title=Cartridges for Long|work=quarryhs.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527062842/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm|archive-date=27 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It also offers an acceptable amount of barrel wear, which is important to military snipers who tend to fire thousands of rounds a year in practice. This was achieved by coupling a sensible case volume (7.40 ml) to bore area (56.86&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>/0.5686&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) [[overbore|ratio]] (13.01 O<sub>ratio</sub>) with ample space for loading relatively long slender projectiles that can provide good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the projectile diameter.<ref group=\"notes\">The Finnish Army found out during a test/trails program and 7 years of service that the barrels of their Sako [[TRG-42]] sniper rifles lasted 7,000 to 8,000 rounds with Lapua Lock Base B408 factory ammunition before showing impermissible accuracy decay. The Finnish Army consistent accuracy requirement for these rifles is \u2264 1 [[Minute of arc|MOA]] at 1,000 m. If this requirement is not met the TRG-42 gets a new barrel. This is normal practice for active high performance precision rifle operators who regard barrels as expendable items. The continuous use of very powerful [[handloading|handloads]] (which results in higher muzzle velocities) resulted in much quicker throat erosion reducing the TRG-42 barrel's accuracy life to 1500 to 2000 rounds.</ref> Like every other comparable large magnum rifle cartridge, the .338 Lapua Magnum presents a stout [[free recoil|recoil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accuratereloading.com/recoil.html|title=RECOIL|work=accuratereloading.com|accessdate=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027205130/http://www.accuratereloading.com/recoil.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> An appropriate fitting [[Stock (firearm)|stock]] and an effective [[muzzle brake]] helps to reduce recoil-induced problems, enabling the operator to fire more rounds before getting too uncomfortable to shoot accurately.

Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using high pressure loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.\n\nThe American [[.338-378 Weatherby Magnum]] cartridge introduced in 1998 and the American [[.338 Remington Ultra Magnum]] (.338 RUM) cartridge introduced in 2000 are probably the closest ballistic twins of the .338 Lapua Magnum commercially available {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum is however a [[Rim (firearms)|belted]] cartridge and the .338 Remington Ultra Magnum is a [[Rim (firearms)|rebated rim]] cartridge.\n\nThe American [[SAAMI]] (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute) has no normal voluntary guidelines for the .338 Lapua Magnum. On 14 January 2013 it opted to use the metric C.I.P. rulings and add some dimensions that have no C.I.P. analog.<ref>[https://saami.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ANSI-SAAMI-Z299.4-CFR-Approved-2015-12-14-Posting-Copy.pdf SAAMI Maximum Cartridge / Minimum Chamber drawing (METRIC) 338 Lapua Magnum, page 116]</ref>\n\n==Supersonic range performance of the .338 Lapua Magnum==\n\n===Performance with C.I.P. conforming cartridges===\nFor a typical .338 Lapua Magnum high end factory military sniper rifle like the Sako [[TRG-42]] with a {{convert|690|mm|1|abbr=on}} long 305&nbsp;mm (1 in 12&nbsp;inch) rifling twist rate barrel at sea level, {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} is considered to be the maximum shooting distance for man sized targets.

However, to be able to maintain 80 to 90% hit probability on non-moving {{convert|45|x|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} reactive army targets, this maximum shooting distance has to be reduced to {{convert|1300|m|yd|0}} at freezing point conditions or {{convert|1100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in Arctic winter conditions, when the muzzle velocity may drop to {{convert|880|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\u2014i.e. only during optimal warm summer conditions the {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} maximum shooting distance is realistically achievable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC116_2_300_338_Rev1.pdf|title=Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) Analysis of the Optimized 300 Winchester Magnum vs 338 Lapua Magnum With Various Ammunition Types by Bryan Litz, Applied Ballistics LLC|access-date=2014-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172716/http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC116_2_300_338_Rev1.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC115_ProbabalisticWEZ.pdf|title=Probabalistic Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) Analysis A Conceptual Overview by Bryan Litz|access-date=2014-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172715/http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/Articles/ABDOC115_ProbabalisticWEZ.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLoaded with more aerodynamic [[very-low-drag bullet]]s such as the traditionally lead cored 19.44 g (300.0 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet ([[ballistic coefficient|G1 BC]] = 0.736) or the Lost River Ballistics J40 .338 17.5&nbsp;gram (270 gr) CNC manufactured mono-metal bullet (G1 BC = 0.871) the long-range performance and supersonic range of .338 Lapua Magnum rifles can be improved. These longer very-low-drag bullets require a 254&nbsp;mm (1 in 10&nbsp;inch) twist rate to stabilize them. Due to the lower practically possible muzzle velocities for a relative heavy bullet like the 19.44 g (300 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet it gains about {{convert|104|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} extra supersonic range under [[International Standard Atmosphere]] sea level conditions ([[air density]] \u03c1 = 1.225&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>) at a muzzle velocity of 837&nbsp;m/s (2750&nbsp;ft/s) when compared to the standard 16.2 g (250 gr) Lapua Scenar GB488 VLD at a muzzle velocity of 915&nbsp;m/s (3002&nbsp;ft/s). For significant supersonic range improvement the aerodynamic efficiency of the employed bullets has to be significantly improved without sacrificing a lot of practically achievable muzzle velocity - meaning that besides the [[coefficient of drag]] of the projectile weight is also an important parameter for its actual downrange flight behavior. The .338 17.5&nbsp;gram (270 gr) Lost River Ballistic Technologies J40 match bullet made out of a copper-nickel alloy is one of the most aerodynamic .338 calibre bullets available. It has an {{convert|1800|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} supersonic range under optimal warm summer conditions at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|869|m/s|abbr=on}}. This makes engaging static targets up to {{convert|1800|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} feasible.\n\n===Performance improvement experiments with non-C.I.P.-conforming cartridges===\nImprovement beyond this standard while still using standard .338 Lapua Magnum brass is possible, but the bullets have to be very long (over 5.5 calibers in length) and the normal cartridge overall length of 93.5&nbsp;mm has to be exceeded making such cartridges [[Wildcat cartridge|wildcats]]. The common 254&nbsp;mm (1:10&nbsp;inch) rifling twist rate also has to be tightened to stabilize very long projectiles.

The [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for the .343 Lapua Magnum LM-107 wildcat cartridge was chosen at 180&nbsp;mm (1:7&nbsp;inch), \u00d8 lands = 8.72&nbsp;mm, \u00d8 grooves = 8.45&nbsp;mm and loaded with the LM-107 projectile has a cartridge overall length of {{convert|107|mm|in}}. The length of the neck is increased from 8,31 to 8,50&nbsp;mm to support the bigger LM-107 bullet. Several other dimensions of the .338 Lapua Magnum parental cartridge are also changed. The shoulder angle gets steepened from 40\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and the body taper is set at 1\u00b0. The throat area is set at a 2\u00b0 cone-angle. All this modifications make the .343 Lapua Magnum a fairly comprehensively revised wildcat cartridge. Out of a {{convert|900|mm|in|1}} long progressive twist barrel Mr. M\u00f6ller expected to achieve {{convert|909|m/s|ft/s|0}} muzzle velocity. If M\u00f6ller's design assumptions are correct the LM-107 projectile with a calculated G1 BC of 1.02 will offer a supersonic range of \u2248 {{convert|2170|m|yd|-1}} at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|909|m/s|ft/s|0}} under [[International Standard Atmosphere]] sea level conditions ([[air density]] \u03c1 = 1.225&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>).\n\n==.338 Lapua Magnum as a parent case==\n\n===The .300 Lapua Magnum===\nThe commercially successful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the [[.300 Lapua Magnum]], which is essentially a necked-down version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter [[bullet]]s result in very high muzzle velocities.\n\nThe Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua got the .300 Lapua Magnum C.I.P. certified, so it became an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish \"family\" of super magnum rifle cartridges. The .300 Lapua Magnum is not commercially available and currently exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 calibre bullets.\n\nThe .300 Lapua Magnum has a 7.33 [[litre|ml]] (113 [[grain (measure)|grains]] H<sub>2</sub>O) cartridge case capacity.\n\n[[File:.300 Lapua Magnum.svg|400px]]\n\n'''.300 Lapua Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions.'''

The large boltface combined with the high 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) maximum pressure makes that the .300 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large and fierce cartridges and thus high bolt thrust safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.\n\n===The 7.62 UKM===\nThe .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge is also used as the parent case for the German designed [[7.62 UKM]], which is essentially a necked-down shortened version of the .338 Lapua Magnum.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/ma/ZERMEL/762ukm.html The 7.62 UKM.

Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as [[Wildcat cartridge|wildcats]]. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the .338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times, it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters.

(2005) we can differ three different perspectives of '''text mining''', namely text mining as [[information extraction]], text mining as text [[data mining]], and text mining as [[Data mining|KDD]] (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process.<ref>Hotho, A., N\u00fcrnberger, A. and Paa\u00df, G.

High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as [[pattern recognition|statistical pattern learning]]. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a [[database]]), deriving patterns within the [[structured data]], and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], and interest. Typical text mining tasks include [[text categorization]], [[text clustering]], concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, [[sentiment analysis]], [[document summarization]], and entity relation modeling (''i.e.'', learning relations between [[named entity recognition|named entities]]).\n\nText analysis involves [[information retrieval]], [[lexical analysis]] to study word frequency distributions, [[pattern recognition]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]]/[[annotation]], [[information extraction]], [[data mining]] techniques including link and association analysis, [[information visualization|visualization]], and [[predictive analytics]]. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of [[natural language processing]] (NLP), different types of [[algorithm]]s and analytical methods. An important phase of this process is the interpretation of the gathered information.\n\nA typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and either model the [[document]] set for [[predictive classification]] purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.\nThe [[document]] is the basic element while starting with text mining.

Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature's]] proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s common Journal Publishing [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.\n\nAcademic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:\n\n* The [[National Centre for Text Mining]] (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the [[University of Manchester]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk |title=The University of Manchester |publisher=Manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html |title=Tsujii Laboratory |publisher=Tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> [[University of Tokyo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html |title=The University of Tokyo |publisher=UTokyo |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and two of the UK [[Research Council]]s ([[EPSRC]] & [[BBSRC]]).

It was  the second country in the world to do so, following [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009.

As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed\u2014one such use being text and data mining.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books \u2014 a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\nUntil recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a [[semantic web]], text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or [[counter-intelligence]].  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an [[intelligence analyst]] or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email [[spam filter]]s as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial [[market sentiment]].\n\n==Future==\nIncreasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning.\n\nThe challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in \"unstructured\" form has been recognized for decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics by Seth Grimes|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Beyenetwork|accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> It is recognized in the earliest definition of [[business intelligence]] (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nYet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in \"unstructured\" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. [[Marti Hearst|Marti A. Hearst]] in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:<ref>{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics|last1=Hearst|first1=Marti A.|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55860-609-8|pages=3\u201310|chapter=Untangling text data mining|doi=10.3115/1034678.1034679|chapter-url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.\n</blockquote>\n\nHearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Document processing]]\n* [[Full text search]]\n* [[List of text mining software]]\n* [[Market sentiment]]\n* [[Name resolution (semantics and text extraction)]]\n* [[Named entity recognition]]\n* [[News analytics]]\n* [[Ontology learning]]\n* [[Record linkage]]\n* [[Sequential pattern mining]] (string and sequence mining)\n* [[w-shingling]]\n* [[Web mining]], a task that may involve text mining (e.g. first find appropriate web pages by classifying crawled web pages, then extract the desired information from the text content of these pages considered relevant)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Ananiadou, S. and McNaught, J.

High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as [[pattern recognition|statistical pattern learning]]. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a [[database]]), deriving patterns within the [[structured data]], and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], and interest. Typical text mining tasks include [[text categorization]], [[text clustering]], concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, [[sentiment analysis]], [[document summarization]], and entity relation modeling (''i.e.'', learning relations between [[named entity recognition|named entities]]).\n\nText analysis involves [[information retrieval]], [[lexical analysis]] to study word frequency distributions, [[pattern recognition]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]]/[[annotation]], [[information extraction]], [[data mining]] techniques including link and association analysis, [[information visualization|visualization]], and [[predictive analytics]]. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of [[natural language processing]] (NLP), different types of [[algorithm]]s and analytical methods. An important phase of this process is the interpretation of the gathered information.\n\nA typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and either model the [[document]] set for [[predictive classification]] purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.\nThe [[document]] is the basic element while starting with text mining. Here, we define a document as a unit of textual data, which normally exists in many types of collections.<ref>Feldman, R. and Sanger, J. (2007). The text mining handbook. Cambridge University Press.

Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.\n\n===Business and marketing applications===\nText mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical [[customer relationship management]].<ref name=\"Text Analytics: The \u201cWhy\u201d Behind the Score\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medallia.com/text-analytics/ |title=Text Analytics |publisher=Medallia |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)<ref name=\"10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:08/502 |title=Integrating the voice of customers through call center emails into a decision support system for churn prediction |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Information & Management |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=164\u201374|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.3238 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2007.10.010 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:07/481 |title=Improving customer complaint management by automatic email classification using linguistic style features as predictors |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=870\u201382}}</ref> apply it to improve [[predictive analytics]] models for customer churn ([[customer attrition]]).<ref name=\"10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005\" /> Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.<ref name=\"Galvez2017\">{{cite journal | title=Assessing the usefulness of online message board mining in automatic stock prediction systems |author1=Ramiro H.

This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature's]] proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s common Journal Publishing [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.\n\nAcademic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:\n\n* The [[National Centre for Text Mining]] (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the [[University of Manchester]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk |title=The University of Manchester |publisher=Manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html |title=Tsujii Laboratory |publisher=Tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> [[University of Tokyo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html |title=The University of Tokyo |publisher=UTokyo |accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and two of the UK [[Research Council]]s ([[EPSRC]] & [[BBSRC]]). With an initial focus on text mining in the [[biology|biological]] and [[biomedical]] sciences, research has since expanded into the areas of [[social sciences]].\n* In the United States, the [[UC Berkeley School of Information|School of Information]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] is developing a program called BioText to assist [[biology]] researchers in text mining and analysis.\n* The [[Text Analysis Portal for Research]] (TAPoR), currently housed at the [[University of Alberta]], is a scholarly project to catalogue text analysis applications and create a gateway for researchers new to the practice.\n\n==== Methods for scientific literature mining ====\nComputational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature.

Key enabling technologies have been parsing, [[machine translation]], topic [[categorization]], and machine learning.\n\n[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data & Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015</ref>]]\nThe automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.<ref>Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora; S Sudhahar, G De Fazio, R Franzosi, N Cristianini; Natural Language Engineering, 1-32, 2013</ref> This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,<ref>Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University \u00a9 2010</ref> whereby [[subject-verb-object]] triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time.

It was  the second country in the world to do so, following [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the [[Information Society Directive]] (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and [[data mining]] in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=[[Association of European Research Libraries]]|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=2013-04-25}}</ref>\n\n===Situation in the United States===\n[[Copyright law of the United States|US copyright law]], and in particular its [[fair use]] provisions, means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed\u2014one such use being text and data mining.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books \u2014 a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\nUntil recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a [[semantic web]], text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or [[counter-intelligence]].  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an [[intelligence analyst]] or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email [[spam filter]]s as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial [[market sentiment]].\n\n==Future==\nIncreasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning.\n\nThe challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in \"unstructured\" form has been recognized for decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics by Seth Grimes|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Beyenetwork|accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> It is recognized in the earliest definition of [[business intelligence]] (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nYet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in \"unstructured\" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. [[Marti Hearst|Marti A. Hearst]] in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:<ref>{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics|last1=Hearst|first1=Marti A.|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55860-609-8|pages=3\u201310|chapter=Untangling text data mining|doi=10.3115/1034678.1034679|chapter-url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.\n</blockquote>\n\nHearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Document processing]]\n* [[Full text search]]\n* [[List of text mining software]]\n* [[Market sentiment]]\n* [[Name resolution (semantics and text extraction)]]\n* [[Named entity recognition]]\n* [[News analytics]]\n* [[Ontology learning]]\n* [[Record linkage]]\n* [[Sequential pattern mining]] (string and sequence mining)\n* [[w-shingling]]\n* [[Web mining]], a task that may involve text mining (e.g. first find appropriate web pages by classifying crawled web pages, then extract the desired information from the text content of these pages considered relevant)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Ananiadou, S. and McNaught, J.

However, having no transport and needing to get from Dublin to Edenderry, he decided to steal a car.\n\nOn 22 July 1982, a nurse named Bridie Gargan (aged 27) had been [[sunbathing]] in the [[Phoenix Park]] in Dublin during her time off work. MacArthur, intending to steal her car, bludgeoned her with a hammer. In the ensuing confusion, MacArthur drove off, leaving the dying Gargan on the back seat.\n\nAt this point a passing ambulance became involved and escorted MacArthur to the hospital, as the driver mistook him for a doctor because of a windscreen sticker which Gargan had. MacArthur later abandoned the car nearby. Three days later, having found alternative means to get to Edenderry, MacArthur visited the farmer D\u00f3nal Dunne and murdered him with his own shotgun after examining it. MacArthur then stole Dunne's car and drove it to Dublin. These two violent murders created a sensation, as unmotivated murder in Ireland, coupled with the youth and respectability of the nurse and farmer, was an unusual set of circumstances.\n\nThe [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] (Irish police) soon had a description of the person they wanted.\n\n==Fallout==\nMacArthur was acquainted with [[Patrick Connolly]], the then [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], who was the chief legal advisor to the [[Irish Government]]. Both attended a match in [[Croke Park]], several days after the murder, and this led to a discussion between Connolly, MacArthur, and the then Garda Commissioner, Patrick McLoughlin, regarding the murder. (MacArthur even asked McLoughlin about the investigation of the \"dreadful\" murder.) On 13 August 1982, after a massive search, MacArthur was arrested on the private property of Connolly, where he had been staying for some time as a guest. Connolly, who had been getting ready for holiday, continued on his journey to the United States and did not give any interview to the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda\u00ed]] on the matter.\n\nA serious effort was made to prevent the relationship between Connolly and MacArthur becoming public and indeed it was claimed that this was homosexual, something that was later discounted. Connolly was promptly requested to return to Ireland where he then resigned on 16 August. Haughey attempted to distance himself from the fiasco and described the event as \"a bizarre happening, an unprecedented situation, a grotesque situation, an almost unbelievable mischance.\"\n\nMacArthur admitted his guilt of the murder of the nurse. Because of this, he was not tried for Dunne's murder as the state entered a plea of ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. This led to a petition of 10,000 signatures to ensure MacArthur would be tried for his murder. This was unsuccessful and MacArthur received a life sentence for just one murder.\n\n==After conviction==\nIn 2003 the parole board recommended that MacArthur be put on a temporary release program which would eventually lead to his release.

From its secure bases in [[Bulgaria]] it launched armed attacks and propaganda campaigns into [[Northern Greece]] and [[Vardar Banovina]]. Although it appeared as well organized group, it had its own left wing. In the early 1920s, the IMRO split over the ultimate goal of its activity. The right faction led by [[Alexandar Protogerov]] sought incorporation of all [[Region of Macedonia|Macedonian]] territory into Bulgaria, while the left faction sought an autonomous Macedonia that could join [[Balkan Federative Republic]]. In December 1921, left-leaning deserters formed the official\n''Macedonian Emigre's Federalist Organization'' (''MEFO''). In 1922 another group of former Aleksandrov's supporters formed the clandestine ''Macedonian Federative Revolutionary Organization'' (''MFRO'').\n\n===Origins and goals===\n\nViolence between the two groups reinforced a political crisis growing public impression that Bulgarian governments were unstable. Both wings of the MFO supported the creation of a federal [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] state within a future [[Balkan Federation]], which concept was similar to the ideas proclaimed by the [[Balkan Communist Federation]] at that time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&pg=PA81&dq=Macedonian+FederaLIST+OrganiSation+1921&hl=bg&ei=K6kuTa3QEoODOuCzpLcK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=mfo&f=false Who are the Macedonians?] Hugh Poulton, C.

The initial leaders of that movement were [[Filip Atanasov]], [[Todor Panitsa]] and [[Hristo Tatarchev]]. Its  adherents were commonly known as \"federalists\" by way of distinction from the IMRO-members known as \"autonomists\". As for the relations of the Organization with the Bulgarian government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], it supported the federalist's movement and was openly hostile to the aspirations of the autonomists. MFO organized a number of armed forays into [[Pirin Macedonia]] (Nevrokop and Kyustendil), where it attacked the local IMRO detachments.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&pg=PA324 The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics], Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8014-9493-1}}, p. 324.</ref> In March 1923, Stamboliyski, in consequence of the Yugoslav-Bulgarian agreement reached in [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], began cooperating with [[Yugoslavia]] against IMRO. Aided by the government, the federalists set out to destroy the military network of the enemy, but the autonomists scattered the federalist's [[Cheta (armed group)|cheta]]s and launched an attack on the Stamboliyski's government.\n\n===Decline and dissolution===\n[[File:Kongres of MFO 1923.jpg|right|thumb|300pp|Poster with the participants on the third Congress of MFO (1923).]]\n\nIn the Summer of 1923, IMRO aided by radical officers, [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1923|organized a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The fall of the government was a great success to the power of  IMRO. The government was condemned by the [[Communist International]], as well as the absent communist resistance to it. When the communists aided by the federalists did try to revolt in the [[September Uprising]], they were quickly crushed by the government and its IMRO allies. As a result, some of the fleeing federalists placed themselves in [[Serbia]]n service, others collaborated with the [[Greeks]]. Panitsa also had to flee and went in [[Vienna]], where the federalist's leadership began seeking foreign contacts, especially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] diplomats. They served as mediators by consecution of secret reconciling negotiations with IMRO. Continuing into 1924 secret negotiations between the federalists, BCP and IMRO representatives were conducted to unite all groups under the goal of independence or autonomy of a Macedonian state. The new position of the IMRO was identical to that of the Balkan communists and won for the MFO the endorsement of its policy by the [[Comintern]]. Lately IMRO officially rejected its support of the document and its leaders even denied endorsing it.

From its secure bases in [[Bulgaria]] it launched armed attacks and propaganda campaigns into [[Northern Greece]] and [[Vardar Banovina]]. Although it appeared as well organized group, it had its own left wing. In the early 1920s, the IMRO split over the ultimate goal of its activity. The right faction led by [[Alexandar Protogerov]] sought incorporation of all [[Region of Macedonia|Macedonian]] territory into Bulgaria, while the left faction sought an autonomous Macedonia that could join [[Balkan Federative Republic]]. In December 1921, left-leaning deserters formed the official\n''Macedonian Emigre's Federalist Organization'' (''MEFO''). In 1922 another group of former Aleksandrov's supporters formed the clandestine ''Macedonian Federative Revolutionary Organization'' (''MFRO'').\n\n===Origins and goals===\n\nViolence between the two groups reinforced a political crisis growing public impression that Bulgarian governments were unstable. Both wings of the MFO supported the creation of a federal [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] state within a future [[Balkan Federation]], which concept was similar to the ideas proclaimed by the [[Balkan Communist Federation]] at that time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&pg=PA81&dq=Macedonian+FederaLIST+OrganiSation+1921&hl=bg&ei=K6kuTa3QEoODOuCzpLcK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=mfo&f=false Who are the Macedonians?] Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|1-85065-534-0}}, p. 81.</ref> The federalists' programme contained a bizarre formulation of a future Macedonian state using [[Esperanto]] as official language. The initial leaders of that movement were [[Filip Atanasov]], [[Todor Panitsa]] and [[Hristo Tatarchev]]. Its  adherents were commonly known as \"federalists\" by way of distinction from the IMRO-members known as \"autonomists\". As for the relations of the Organization with the Bulgarian government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], it supported the federalist's movement and was openly hostile to the aspirations of the autonomists. MFO organized a number of armed forays into [[Pirin Macedonia]] (Nevrokop and Kyustendil), where it attacked the local IMRO detachments.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&pg=PA324 The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics], Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8014-9493-1}}, p. 324.</ref> In March 1923, Stamboliyski, in consequence of the Yugoslav-Bulgarian agreement reached in [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], began cooperating with [[Yugoslavia]] against IMRO. Aided by the government, the federalists set out to destroy the military network of the enemy, but the autonomists scattered the federalist's [[cheta]]s and launched an attack on the Stamboliyski's government.\n\n===Decline and dissolution===\n[[File:Kongres of MFO 1923.jpg|right|thumb|300pp|Poster with the participants on the third Congress of MFO (1923).]]\n\nIn the Summer of 1923, IMRO aided by radical officers, [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1923|organized a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The fall of the government was a great success to the power of  IMRO. The government was condemned by the [[Communist International]], as well as the absent communist resistance to it. When the communists aided by the federalists did try to revolt in the [[September Uprising]], they were quickly crushed by the government and its IMRO allies. As a result, some of the fleeing federalists placed themselves in [[Serbia]]n service, others collaborated with the [[Greeks]]. Panitsa also had to flee and went in [[Vienna]], where the federalist's leadership began seeking foreign contacts, especially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] diplomats. They served as mediators by consecution of secret reconciling negotiations with IMRO. Continuing into 1924 secret negotiations between the federalists, BCP and IMRO representatives were conducted to unite all groups under the goal of independence or autonomy of a Macedonian state. The new position of the IMRO was identical to that of the Balkan communists and won for the MFO the endorsement of its policy by the [[Comintern]]. Lately IMRO officially rejected its support of the document and its leaders even denied endorsing it. In the aftermath of the failed agreement (the so-called [[May Manifesto]] from 1924) Todor Alexandrov, as well as key figures of the ''Federalists'', were assassinated in the subsequent clash. Weakened the organization disappeared as a real entity.

Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, actresses and sports figures. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different rates.\n#'''Definite Loss'''. The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n#'''Accidental Loss'''.  The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance.  The loss should be \u2018pure,\u2019 in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost.  Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.\n#'''Large Loss'''.  The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.  Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.  For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses.  There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n#'''Affordable Premium'''.  If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer.  Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer.  If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance.  (See the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] [[List of FASB Pronouncements|standard number 113]])\n#'''Calculable Loss'''. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n#'''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses'''.  Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-[[catastrophe modeling|catastrophic]], meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 [[Percentage|percent]]. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of [[nanotechnology]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance.</ref> In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint.  Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n==Insurable interest==\n{{Main|Insurable interest}}\n\nInsurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.<ref name=Interest>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Insurable+interest The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest], citing cases at 1 Burr. 489.

Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n#'''Accidental Loss'''.  The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance.  The loss should be \u2018pure,\u2019 in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost.  Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.\n#'''Large Loss'''.  The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.  Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.  For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses.  There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n#'''Affordable Premium'''.  If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer.  Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer.  If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance.  (See the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] [[List of FASB Pronouncements|standard number 113]])\n#'''Calculable Loss'''. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n#'''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses'''.  Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-[[catastrophe modeling|catastrophic]], meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 [[Percentage|percent]]. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of [[nanotechnology]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance.</ref> In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint.  Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n==Insurable interest==\n{{Main|Insurable interest}}\n\nInsurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.<ref name=Interest>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Insurable+interest The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest], citing cases at 1 Burr. 489.

The film commences in a hospital, where Susheela is awaiting her second delivery. Much to the disappointment of her husband Madhu and his family, she delivers another daughter. Raju leaves hospital without even giving a glance at the newborn.\n\nThe newly transferred police inspector (portrayed by Ratheesh) reaches the place midnight and boards a taxi, which is driven by Rahim. Rahim drops him at the place he wanted, however a small debate begins when Rahim demands 25 Rs when the meter charge displays 9 Rs 40 paise, as it is 2 a.m. As the house maids inform Rahim that he is the commissioner, Rahim would compromises with any amount. However, the inspector gives him the money he had asked for.\n\nSusheela is the second daughter in a family of four daughters and a son ([[Rajkumar Sethupathi|Rajkumar]]). Their father is portrayed by [[Balan K. Nair]] and mother by [[Santha Kumari]]. The eldest daughter Vimala is still unmarried, as she had been cheated by her lover ([[Ratheesh]]). After completing LLB, she starts practising under an Advocate. The third daughter (Rekha) is a college student having an affair. While the fourth is a student in youth. The son demands for more money from his father for his marriage expenses, and finally, an irritated father handles over the gold chain of Rekha to him.\n\nThe police inspector, being a family friend, pays a visit to Vimala's house and gets surprised on hearing that she is still single.\n\nRahim drops his owner's wife and sister Ayisha for a festival purchase to a textile shop. While her sister-in-law goes to another section for the purchase, Ayisha purchases a shirt. The salesman in the textile shop is portrayed by [[Kuthiravattam Pappu]]. After the purchase Rahim drops them back to their house.\n\nSusheela has a tough job as a housewife doing all the work in her husbands house - looking after the two daughters, handling kitchen duties by making dishes of each of their choice, washing clothes including that of her husband's brother. Once the younger kid was affected with fever, she had placed her younger kid to sleep in the cot. She was waiting for Madhu to reach home, so as to take dinner with him. However Madhu comes home after taking dinner and was drunk. He goes to bed, and on seeing the younger kid on bed, asks Susheela to place her on the mat on the ground. Being affected with fever, the kid was crying throughout the night and Madhu asks Susheela to take the kid away from the room. Susheela takes the kid out, and somehow makes her asleep and takes her back to the mat. By that time it was early morning and Madhu's father asks for the morning tea. So she goes straight to kitchen to start the regular household activities.\n\nAyisha is a widow. She was married to a very old man in a very younger age. On seeing her husband's face for the first time, she was frightened, and so she left her husbands house. After a few days, they got a telegram that he is no more. Ayisha's brother and wife plot to get her share of property. They plan to get her signature on the document by making her believe that the agreement was to make her partner in her brother's business. Ayisha handles the newly bought shirt to Rahim (their driver) as a festival gift.\n\nMadhu slaps and shouts at his wife for taking money from his purse without asking him. Susheela had taken money in the morning for buying tonic (medicine) for her younger daughter who was ill. Madhu throws and breaks the medicine bottle and shouts heavily at her. This irritates Madhu's family and his father and brother asks them to leave the house, so that they could live peacefully there.\n\nVimala's brother marries Vidhu. Vidhu's parents (portrayed by [[Sankaradi]] and [[Sukumari]]) visit their house, and they take them to their estate. Vidhu's mother trickily makes Vidhu's husband agree that he leave his family and stay with them.\n\nWhile returning from the job one night Rahim finds her sister weeping. She tells her that she got a letter from a person named Purushotham. While tracing the From address in the letter Rahim finds him in a hotel. Rahim beats Purushotham. However, only after he gets arrested, he comes to know that Puroshotham is a police constable.\n\nMadhu, Susheela and their kids move to a new house. Susheela and kids wait for Madhu to take the dinner. However, Madhu comes home with some of his friends and asks her to cook meat and fish which he had bought. They start consuming liquor and make noise, while Susheela cooks the meat and fish. In the meanwhile, the kids fell asleep starving. Later, Susheela wakes up to find that the entire place is made dirty by Madhu and his friends.\n\nRahim arranges her sisters wedding with a textile salesman ([[Kuthiravattam Pappu]]), who has many demands including a rubber bed, a radio, etc. Rahim asks the money lent to Vimala's father during the marriage of his son; so as to meet the demands of his would-be brother-n-law. Vimala's father goes to his son, however his son returns him empty handed. Ayisha hands her necklace to Rahim's sister for her marriage.\n\nSusheela returns to her house with the younger child weeping. She tells Vimala that she saw her husband with another lady in the bedroom, so she had to leave the house. However her elder daughter is still with Madhu. To get the daughter, Susheela's father pays a visit to Madhu's house. However Madhu treats him very badly and drags away the elder daughter who desperately wanted to go with her grandfather to meet her mother. On reaching home, he gets paralysis and finally become bed ridden.\n\nAiysha's brother gets the registrar to their home to get her signature. While the registrar asks Aiysha whether she knows the contents in the document, she nods that she is aware of it. However, when registrar asks for a witness, Aiysha's brother calls Rahim who was cleaning the car there. Rahim tells firmly that he needs to know the contents of the document before signing it. Then the registrar mentions that it is for transferring the ownership of all Aiysha's properties to her brother. On hearing this, Aiysha is surprised and she tells that she is not willing to sign the document, and that she was falsely told that the document was for a business partnership. Aiysha's brother gets angry, and so plans to trap Rahim. His wife tells him that Aiysha had given her ornaments to Rahim's sister.\n\nSusheela goes to Madhu's house to find her elder daughter locked in it in a very poor condition. She breaks open the door lock and takes her daughter away.\n\nIn the meanwhile Vimala gets a divorce case from the wife ([[Sathyakala]]) of the police inspector. She tells that her husband is still bothered about his ex-lover and pays less attention to her. Vimala talks with the inspector and tells him that his current position is not matching her current job as a lawyer. This makes him go back to his wife and they stay happy.\n\nMadhu comes to Susheela's house to take the daughter. However, she does not give her daughter. While Madhu tries to take the kid forcefully, their neighbour Rahim interferes and Madhu had to take leave.\n\nAiysha's brother files a complaint about a gold chain missing from their house and Police traces that chain from Rahim's house. Rahim is taken into police custody and is brutally beaten up. However he did not admit it. Aiysha comes to police station and tells that it was her chain and she had given it as a gift to Rahim's sister for her marriage. On hearing this, the police inspector feels pity and sets Rahim free.\n\nSusheela gets a divorce notice from her husband, demanding the custody of the kids also.\n\nIn the meantime Vimala's brother's life also becomes miserable. They move to another house and he had to carry the burden of his wife's parents too, which leads to some difference between them.\n\nRahim sends some religious members to ask Aiysha's hand in marriage, to which Aiysha's brother behaves harshly. Rahim comes in and takes Aiysha with him. Though her brother tries to block her, she leaves with Rahim.\n\nBeing repeatedly frightened by bad dreams of Madhu taking away the kids, Susheela plans to commit suicide and jumps into a river with her kids. Though Susheela is rescued, her children get drowned and killed.\n\nThe film ends with Vimala pleading in the court to hang Susheela, so that she will no longer be hunted and also for the crime she has committed.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music was composed by [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]] and the lyrics were written by [[Yusufali Kechery]].\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics''' || '''Length (m:ss)'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Chundo Chendo\"  || [[K.

The film commences in a hospital, where Susheela is awaiting her second delivery. Much to the disappointment of her husband Madhu and his family, she delivers another daughter. Raju leaves hospital without even giving a glance at the newborn.\n\nThe newly transferred police inspector (portrayed by Ratheesh) reaches the place midnight and boards a taxi, which is driven by Rahim. Rahim drops him at the place he wanted, however a small debate begins when Rahim demands 25 Rs when the meter charge displays 9 Rs 40 paise, as it is 2 a.m. As the house maids inform Rahim that he is the commissioner, Rahim would compromises with any amount. However, the inspector gives him the money he had asked for.\n\nSusheela is the second daughter in a family of four daughters and a son ([[Rajkumar Sethupathi|Rajkumar]]). Their father is portrayed by [[Balan K. Nair]] and mother by [[Santha Kumari]]. The eldest daughter Vimala is still unmarried, as she had been cheated by her lover ([[Ratheesh]]). After completing LLB, she starts practising under an Advocate. The third daughter (Rekha) is a college student having an affair. While the fourth is a student in youth. The son demands for more money from his father for his marriage expenses, and finally, an irritated father handles over the gold chain of Rekha to him.\n\nThe police inspector, being a family friend, pays a visit to Vimala's house and gets surprised on hearing that she is still single.\n\nRahim drops his owner's wife and sister Ayisha for a festival purchase to a textile shop. While her sister-in-law goes to another section for the purchase, Ayisha purchases a shirt. The salesman in the textile shop is portrayed by [[Kuthiravattam Pappu]]. After the purchase Rahim drops them back to their house.\n\nSusheela has a tough job as a housewife doing all the work in her husbands house - looking after the two daughters, handling kitchen duties by making dishes of each of their choice, washing clothes including that of her husband's brother. Once the younger kid was affected with fever, she had placed her younger kid to sleep in the cot. She was waiting for Madhu to reach home, so as to take dinner with him. However Madhu comes home after taking dinner and was drunk. He goes to bed, and on seeing the younger kid on bed, asks Susheela to place her on the mat on the ground. Being affected with fever, the kid was crying throughout the night and Madhu asks Susheela to take the kid away from the room. Susheela takes the kid out, and somehow makes her asleep and takes her back to the mat. By that time it was early morning and Madhu's father asks for the morning tea. So she goes straight to kitchen to start the regular household activities.\n\nAyisha is a widow. She was married to a very old man in a very younger age. On seeing her husband's face for the first time, she was frightened, and so she left her husbands house. After a few days, they got a telegram that he is no more. Ayisha's brother and wife plot to get her share of property. They plan to get her signature on the document by making her believe that the agreement was to make her partner in her brother's business. Ayisha handles the newly bought shirt to Rahim (their driver) as a festival gift.\n\nMadhu slaps and shouts at his wife for taking money from his purse without asking him. Susheela had taken money in the morning for buying tonic (medicine) for her younger daughter who was ill. Madhu throws and breaks the medicine bottle and shouts heavily at her. This irritates Madhu's family and his father and brother asks them to leave the house, so that they could live peacefully there.\n\nVimala's brother gets married to Vidhu. Vidhu's parents (portrayed by [[Sankaradi]] and [[Sukumari]]) visit their house, and they take them to their estate. Vidhu's mother trickily makes Vidhu's husband to agree that he leave his family and stay with them.\n\nWhile returning from the job one night Rahim finds her sister weeping. She tells her that she got a letter from a person named Purushotham. While tracing the From address in the letter Rahim finds him in a hotel. Rahim beats Purushotham. However, only after he gets arrested, he comes to know that Puroshotham is a police constable.\n\nMadhu, Susheela and their kids move to a new house. Susheela and kids wait for Madhu to take the dinner. However, Madhu comes home with some of his friends and asks her to cook meat and fish which he had bought. They start consuming liquor and make noise, while Susheela cooks the meat and fish. In the meanwhile, the kids fell asleep starving. Later, Susheela wakes up to find that the entire place is made dirty by Madhu and his friends.\n\nRahim arranges her sisters wedding with a textile salesman ([[Kuthiravattam Pappu]]), who has many demands including a rubber bed, a radio, etc. Rahim asks the money lent to Vimala's father during the marriage of his son; so as to meet the demands of his would-be brother-n-law. Vimala's father goes to his son, however his son returns him empty handed. Ayisha hands her necklace to Rahim's sister for her marriage.\n\nSusheela returns to her house with the younger child weeping. She tells Vimala that she saw her husband with another lady in the bedroom, so she had to leave the house. However her elder daughter is still with Madhu. To get the daughter, Susheela's father pays a visit to Madhu's house. However Madhu treats him very badly and drags away the elder daughter who desperately wanted to go with her grandfather to meet her mother. On reaching home, he gets paralysis and finally become bed ridden.\n\nAiysha's brother gets the registrar to their home to get her signature. While the registrar asks Aiysha whether she knows the contents in the document, she nods that she is aware of it. However, when registrar asks for a witness, Aiysha's brother calls Rahim who was cleaning the car there. Rahim tells firmly that he needs to know the contents of the document before signing it. Then the registrar mentions that it is for transferring the ownership of all Aiysha's properties to her brother. On hearing this, Aiysha is surprised and she tells that she is not willing to sign the document, and that she was falsely told that the document was for a business partnership. Aiysha's brother gets angry, and so plans to trap Rahim. His wife tells him that Aiysha had given her ornaments to Rahim's sister.\n\nSusheela goes to Madhu's house to find her elder daughter locked in it in a very poor condition. She breaks open the door lock and takes her daughter away.\n\nIn the meanwhile Vimala gets a divorce case from the wife ([[Sathyakala]]) of the police inspector. She tells that her husband is still bothered about his ex-lover and pays less attention to her. Vimala talks with the inspector and tells him that his current position is not matching her current job as a lawyer. This makes him go back to his wife and they stay happy.\n\nMadhu comes to Susheela's house to take the daughter. However, she does not give her daughter. While Madhu tries to take the kid forcefully, their neighbour Rahim interferes and Madhu had to take leave.\n\nAiysha's brother files a complaint about a gold chain missing from their house and Police traces that chain from Rahim's house. Rahim is taken into police custody and is brutally beaten up. However he did not admit it. Aiysha comes to police station and tells that it was her chain and she had given it as a gift to Rahim's sister for her marriage. On hearing this, the police inspector feels pity and sets Rahim free.\n\nSusheela gets a divorce notice from her husband, demanding the custody of the kids also.\n\nIn the meantime Vimala's brother's life also becomes miserable. They move to another house and he had to carry the burden of his wife's parents too, which leads to some difference between them.\n\nRahim sends some religious members to ask Aiysha's hand in marriage, to which Aiysha's brother behaves harshly. Rahim comes in and takes Aiysha with him. Though her brother tries to block her, she leaves with Rahim.\n\nBeing repeatedly frightened by bad dreams of Madhu taking away the kids, Susheela plans to commit suicide and jumps into a river with her kids. Though Susheela is rescued, her children get drowned and killed.\n\nThe film ends with Vimala pleading in the court to hang Susheela, so that she will no longer be hunted and also for the crime she has committed.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music was composed by [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]] and the lyrics were written by [[Yusufali Kechery]].\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics''' || '''Length (m:ss)'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Chundo Chendo\"  || [[K.

The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (\"Periplus of the Red Sea\"), a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[periplus]] written by an unknown author around the 1st century, contains a detailed description of the Red Sea's ports and sea routes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W.

The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from [[China]] were introduced to the Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the route was broken by the [[Aksumite Empire]] around the 3rd century AD.<ref>{{cite book |last= East |first= W.

They cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], as the first fleet from Europe in modern times to have sailed these waters.\n\nIn 1798, [[France]] ordered General [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] to invade [[Egypt]] and take control of the Red Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer [[Jean-Baptiste Lep\u00e8re]], who took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the [[Pharaoh]]s. Several canals were built in ancient times from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present [[Sweet Water Canal]], but none lasted for long. The [[Suez Canal]] was opened in November 1869. After the [[Second World War]], the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the [[Six-Day War]] culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable to piracy.\n\n==Oceanography==\n[[File:ISS036-E-011050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81566|title=Egyptian Dust Plume, Red Sea|date=8 July 2013|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov}}</ref>]]\nThe Red Sea is between arid land, [[desert]] and [[semi-desert]]. Reef systems are better developed along the Red Sea mainly because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern. The Red Sea water mass-exchanges its water with the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Gulf of Aden]]. These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation in the north and relatively hot water in the south.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe [[climate]] of the Red Sea is the result of two monsoon seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea. Very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about {{convert|26|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the north and {{convert|30|C|F|0|}} in the south, with only about 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (3.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is {{convert|22|C|F|0|}}. Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200&nbsp;m (656&nbsp;ft). The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe [[rainfall]] over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging {{convert|0.06|m|in|2|abbr=on}} per year. The rain is mostly short showers, often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust [[storm]]s. The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in excess evaporation as high as {{convert|205|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]]<ref>[[BBC 2]] television program \"''Oceans 3/8 The Red Sea''\", 8 pm - 9 pm Wednesday 26 November 2008</ref> found surface water temperatures {{convert|28|C|F|0|lk=on}} in winter and up to {{convert|34|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the summer, but despite that extreme heat, the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of [[coral bleaching]], with only 9% infected by ''[[Thalassomonas loyana]]'', the 'white plague' agent. [[Favia|''Favia favus'']] coral there harbours a virus, BA3, which kills ''T. loyana''.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528725.700-virus-power-harnessed-to-protect-red-sea-coral.html 'Virus protects coral from 'white plague','] at [[New Scientist]], 7 July 2012.p.17.</ref>\nPlans are afoot to use samples of these corals' apparently heat-adapted [[commensal]] [[algae]] to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Salinity===\nThe Red Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, owing to high evaporation and low precipitation; no significant rivers or streams drain into the sea, and its southern connection to the [[Gulf of Aden]], an arm of the Indian Ocean, is narrow.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=syn0CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=salinity+of+the+Red+Sea+is+greater+than+the+world+average,#v=onepage&q=salinity%20of%20the%20Red%20Sea%20is%20greater%20than%20the%20world%20average,&f=false|title=The Legacy of Tethys: An Aquatic Biogeography of the Levant|last=Por|first=F.

(Average salinity for the world's [[seawater]] is ~35&nbsp;\u2030 on the Practical Salinity Scale, or PSU; that translates to 3.5% of actual dissolved salts.)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uh6mcZC8yWIC&pg=PA67&dq=salinity+of+the+Red+Sea+is+greater+than+the+world+average,#v=onepage&q=salinity%20of%20the%20Red%20Sea%20is%20greater%20than%20the%20world%20average,&f=false|title=The Egyptian Red Sea: A Diver's Guide|last=Hanauer|first=Eric|date=1988|publisher=Aqua Quest Publications, Inc.|isbn=9780922769049|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tidal range===\nIn general, tide ranges between {{convert|0.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and {{convert|0.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the south near the Gulf of Aden, but it fluctuates between {{convert|0.20|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0.30|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} away from the nodal point. The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal [[sabkha]]s as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than flooding the [[sabkha]]s through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the [[Shoiaba]] area, the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, whereas north of Jeddah in the [[Al-Kharrar]] area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The prevailing north and northeast winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 1\u20132&nbsp;m/s (3&ndash;6.5&nbsp;ft/s). Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near Egypt, Eritrea, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Current===\nDetailed information regarding current data is lacking, partially because the currents are weak and both spatially and temporally variable. The variation of temporal and spatial currents is as low as {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and are governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 15\u201320&nbsp;cm/s (6&ndash;8&nbsp;in/s), whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the north end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is between 50\u201360&nbsp;cm/s (20&ndash;23.6&nbsp;in/s) with a maximum of {{convert|1|m/s|ft/s|1|abbr=on}} at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8\u201329&nbsp;cm/s (3&ndash;11.4&nbsp;in/s).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Wind regime===\nThe north part of the Red Sea is dominated by persistent north-west [[winds]], with speeds ranging between {{convert|7|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}. The rest of the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aden]] are subjected to regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind [[regime]] is characterized by seasonal and regional variations in [[speed]] and [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] with average speed generally increasing northward.<ref>Patzer, W. C. (1974), Wind-induced reversal in the Red Sea circulation, ''Deep Sea Research'', 21, 109-121.</ref>\n\nWind is the driving force in the Red Sea to transport material as suspension or as bedload. Wind-induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in resuspending bottom sediments and transferring materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind-generated current [[measurement]] is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds.<ref>Morcos, S.

Although he failed in his mission, the engineer [[Jean-Baptiste Lep\u00e8re]], who took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the [[Pharaoh]]s. Several canals were built in ancient times from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present [[Sweet Water Canal]], but none lasted for long. The [[Suez Canal]] was opened in November 1869. After the [[Second World War]], the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the [[Six-Day War]] culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable to piracy.\n\n==Oceanography==\n[[File:ISS036-E-011050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81566|title=Egyptian Dust Plume, Red Sea|date=8 July 2013|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov}}</ref>]]\nThe Red Sea is between arid land, [[desert]] and [[semi-desert]]. Reef systems are better developed along the Red Sea mainly because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern. The Red Sea water mass-exchanges its water with the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Gulf of Aden]]. These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation in the north and relatively hot water in the south.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe [[climate]] of the Red Sea is the result of two monsoon seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea. Very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about {{convert|26|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the north and {{convert|30|C|F|0|}} in the south, with only about 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (3.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is {{convert|22|C|F|0|}}. Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200&nbsp;m (656&nbsp;ft). The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe [[rainfall]] over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging {{convert|0.06|m|in|2|abbr=on}} per year. The rain is mostly short showers, often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust [[storm]]s. The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in excess evaporation as high as {{convert|205|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]]<ref>[[BBC 2]] television program \"''Oceans 3/8 The Red Sea''\", 8 pm - 9 pm Wednesday 26 November 2008</ref> found surface water temperatures {{convert|28|C|F|0|lk=on}} in winter and up to {{convert|34|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the summer, but despite that extreme heat, the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of [[coral bleaching]], with only 9% infected by ''[[Thalassomonas loyana]]'', the 'white plague' agent. [[Favia|''Favia favus'']] coral there harbours a virus, BA3, which kills ''T. loyana''.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528725.700-virus-power-harnessed-to-protect-red-sea-coral.html 'Virus protects coral from 'white plague','] at [[New Scientist]], 7 July 2012.p.17.</ref>\nPlans are afoot to use samples of these corals' apparently heat-adapted [[commensal]] [[algae]] to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Salinity===\nThe Red Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, owing to high evaporation and low precipitation; no significant rivers or streams drain into the sea, and its southern connection to the [[Gulf of Aden]], an arm of the Indian Ocean, is narrow.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=syn0CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=salinity+of+the+Red+Sea+is+greater+than+the+world+average,#v=onepage&q=salinity%20of%20the%20Red%20Sea%20is%20greater%20than%20the%20world%20average,&f=false|title=The Legacy of Tethys: An Aquatic Biogeography of the Levant|last=Por|first=F.

The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal [[sabkha]]s as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than flooding the [[sabkha]]s through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the [[Shoiaba]] area, the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, whereas north of Jeddah in the [[Al-Kharrar]] area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The prevailing north and northeast winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 1\u20132&nbsp;m/s (3&ndash;6.5&nbsp;ft/s). Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near Egypt, Eritrea, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Current===\nDetailed information regarding current data is lacking, partially because the currents are weak and both spatially and temporally variable. The variation of temporal and spatial currents is as low as {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and are governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 15\u201320&nbsp;cm/s (6&ndash;8&nbsp;in/s), whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the north end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is between 50\u201360&nbsp;cm/s (20&ndash;23.6&nbsp;in/s) with a maximum of {{convert|1|m/s|ft/s|1|abbr=on}} at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8\u201329&nbsp;cm/s (3&ndash;11.4&nbsp;in/s).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Wind regime===\nThe north part of the Red Sea is dominated by persistent north-west [[winds]], with speeds ranging between {{convert|7|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}. The rest of the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aden]] are subjected to regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind [[regime]] is characterized by seasonal and regional variations in [[speed]] and [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] with average speed generally increasing northward.<ref>Patzer, W. C. (1974), Wind-induced reversal in the Red Sea circulation, ''Deep Sea Research'', 21, 109-121.</ref>\n\nWind is the driving force in the Red Sea to transport material as suspension or as bedload. Wind-induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in resuspending bottom sediments and transferring materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind-generated current [[measurement]] is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds.<ref>Morcos, S.

Government-related bodies with responsibility to police the Red Sea area include the [[Port Said Port Authority]], [[Suez Canal Authority]] and [[Red Sea Ports Authority]] of [[Egypt]], [[Jordan Maritime Authority]], [[Israel Port Authority]], [[Saudi Ports Authority]] and [[Sea Ports Corporation, Sudan|Sea Ports Corporation]] of [[Sudan]].\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n{{Trivia|section|date=May 2019}}\n:* Length:  ~{{convert|2250|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} - 79% of the eastern Red Sea with numerous coastal inlets\n:* Maximum Width:  ~ 306\u2013355 km (190&ndash;220&nbsp;mi)\u2013 Massawa (Eritrea)\n:* Minimum Width:   ~ 26\u201329 km (16&ndash;18&nbsp;mi)- [[Bab el Mandeb]] Strait (Yemen)\n:* Average Width:  ~ {{convert|280|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n:* Average Depth:  ~ {{convert|490|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}\n:* Maximum Depth:  ~ {{convert|3040|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n:* Surface Area: 438-450 x 10<sup>2</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (16,900&ndash;17,400&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)\n:* Volume: 215\u2013251 x 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> (51,600&ndash;60,200&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi)\n\n:* Approximately 40% of the Red Sea is quite shallow (under 100 m/330&nbsp;ft), and about 25% is under {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep.\n:* About 15% of the Red Sea is over {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} depth that forms the deep axial trough.\n:* Shelf breaks are marked by coral reefs\n:* Continental slope has an irregular profile (series of steps down to  ~{{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}})\n:* Centre of Red Sea has a narrow trough (''Suakin Trough'') (~ {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}; with maximum depth {{convert|3040|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}})\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Elath Eilat Israel Strand Hotel datafox.jpg|thumb|Hotels in [[Eilat]], [[Israel]]]]\nThe sea is known for its [[recreational diving]] sites, such as [[Ras Mohammed]], [[SS Thistlegorm]] (shipwreck), [[Elphinstone Reef]], [[The Brothers, Egypt|The Brothers]], [[Daedalus Reef]], [[St.John's Reef]], [[Rocky Island (Egypt)|Rocky Island]] in [[Egypt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dive-the-world.com/diving-sites-red-sea.php|title=Scuba Diving in Egypt - Red Sea - Dive The World Vacations|website=www.dive-the-world.com}}</ref> and less known sites in [[Sudan]] such as [[Sanganeb]], [[Abington, Sudan|Abington]], [[Angarosh]] and [[Shaab Rumi]].\n\nThe Red Sea became a popular destination for diving after the expeditions of [[Hans Hass]] in the 1950s, and later by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]].<ref name=\"Cousteau\">{{cite AV media | people =Philippe Cousteau Jnr | date = 23 April 2010 | title =Jacques Cousteau's underworld village in the Red Sea   | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mTCj-DUHro | access-date =11 December 2018 | publisher =BBC Earth\n}}</ref> Popular tourist resorts include [[El Gouna]], [[Hurghada]], [[Safaga]], [[Marsa Alam]], on the west shore of the Red Sea, and [[Sharm-el-Sheikh]], [[Dahab]], and [[Taba, Egypt|Taba]] on the [[Egypt]]ian side of [[Sina\u00ef]], as well as [[Aqaba]] in [[Jordan]] and [[Eilat]] in [[Israel]] in an area known as the [[Red Sea Riviera]].\n\nThe popular tourist beach of Sharm el-Sheikh was closed to all swimming in December 2010 due to several serious [[2010 Sharm El Sheikh shark attacks|shark attacks]], including a fatality. As of December 2010, scientists are investigating the attacks and have identified, but not verified, several possible causes including over-fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore, tourist boat operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities, and reports of ships throwing dead livestock overboard. The sea's narrowness, significant depth, and sharp drop-offs, all combine to form a geography where large deep-water sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water, yet be within a hundred meters of swimming areas.\n\n{{see also|2016 Hurghada attack|2017 Hurghada attack|2006 Dahab bombings|2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings|2004 Sinai bombings|Metrojet Flight 9268}}\nTourism to the region has been threatened by occasional terrorist attacks, and by incidents related to food safety standards.<ref name=\"WalshKaraszDeath\">{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Declan |last2=Karasz |first2=Palko |title=Hundreds of Tourists Evacuated From Hotel in Egypt After Britons' Sudden Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/world/middleeast/egypt-hotel-thomas-cook.html |accessdate=26 August 2018 |newspaper=New York Times |date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"RegevCriticalBlow\">{{cite news|last1=Regev|first1=Dana|title=Egypt's tourism industry suffers a critical blow|url=http://www.dw.com/en/egypts-tourism-industry-suffers-a-critical-blow/a-39705321|accessdate=26 August 2018|publisher=DW|date=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Bordering countries==\nThe Red Sea may be geographically divided into three sections: the Red Sea proper, and in the north, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez.

The Gulf of Aqaba borders Egypt, [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering the Red Sea cited above, areas such as [[Somalia]] are sometimes also described as Red Sea territories. This is primarily due to their proximity to and geological similarities with the nations facing the Red Sea and/or political ties with said areas.<ref name=\"Barth\">{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Hans-J\u00f6rg|title=Sabkha ecosystems, Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-0504-0|page=148|url=}}</ref><ref name=\"Makinda\">{{cite book|last=Makinda|first=Samuel M.|title=Superpower diplomacy in the Horn of Africa|year=1987|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7099-4662-7|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cYOAAAAQAAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Towns and cities==\nTowns and cities on the Red Sea coast (including the coasts of the Gulfs of Aqaba and Suez) include:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* {{flagicon|Yemen}} [[Al Hudaydah]] (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Al Lith]] (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0650\u0651\u062b)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Al Qunfudhah]] (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0641\u0630\u0629)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusair]] (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Al Wajh]] (\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647)\n* {{flagicon|Jordan}} [[Aqaba]] (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629)\n* {{flagicon|Eritrea}} [[Asseb]] (\u0639\u0635\u0628/\u12d3\u1230\u1265)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Dahab]] (\u062f\u0647\u0628)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Duba, Saudi Arabia|Duba]] (\u0636\u0628\u0627\u0621)\n* {{flagicon|Israel}} [[Eilat]] (\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea/\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062a)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[El Gouna]] (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0646\u0629)\n{{col-4}}\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Suez|El Suweis]] (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0633)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}}/{{flagicon|Sudan}} [[Hala'ib]] (\u062d\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0628) (disputed)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Haql]] (\u062d\u0642\u0644)\n* {{flagicon|Eritrea}} [[Hirgigo]] (\u062d\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0648/\u1215\u122d\u130a\u130e)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Hurghada]] (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u062f\u0642\u0629)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Jeddah]] (\u062c\u062f\u0629)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Jizan|Jazan]] (\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Marsa Alam]] (\u0645\u0631\u0633\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0645)\n* {{flagicon|Eritrea}} [[Massawa]] (\u0645\u0635\u0648\u0639/\u121d\u133d\u12cb\u12d5)\n* {{flagicon|Djibouti}} [[Moulhoule]] (\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0648\u0644\u0629 ) \n{{col-4}} \n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Nuweiba]] (\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0628\u0639)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Port Safaga]] (\u0645\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0633\u0641\u0627\u062c\u0627)\n* {{flagicon|Sudan}} [[Port Sudan]] (\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Rabigh]] (\u0631\u0627\u0628\u063a)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Sharm el Sheikh]] (\u0634\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Soma Bay]] (\u0633\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u064a)\n* {{flagicon|Sudan}} [[Suakin]] (\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0646)\n* {{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] (\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0627)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Thuwal]] (\u062b\u0648\u0644)\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} [[Yanbu]] (\u064a\u0646\u0628\u0639)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Benjamin Kahn]]\n* {{MS|al-Salam Boccaccio 98}} ferry disaster\n* [[Parting of the Red Sea]], a Biblical tale from the [[Book of Exodus]]\n* [[Red Sea Dam]]\n* [[Robert Moresby]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |last=Hamblin |first=W.
