quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

About 33% to 35% of asteroids in the main belt are family members.\n\nThere are about 20 to 30 reliably recognized families, with several tens of less certain groupings. Most asteroid families are found in the [[main belt|main asteroid belt]], although several family-like groups such as the [[Pallas family]], [[Hungaria family]], and the [[Phocaea family]] lie at smaller [[semi-major axis]] or larger inclination than the main belt.\n\n[[Haumea family|One family]] has been identified associated with the [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.<ref name=\"BrownBarkume2007\">[[Michael E. Brown]], Kristina M. Barkume, Darin Ragozzine & Emily L. Schaller, ''A collisional family of icy objects in the Kuiper belt'', Nature, '''446''', (March 2007), pp 294-296.</ref> Some studies have tried to find evidence of collisional families among the [[trojan asteroid]]s, but at present the evidence is inconclusive.\n\n==Origin and evolution==\nThe families are thought to form as a result of collisions between asteroids. In many or most cases the parent body was shattered, but there are also several families which resulted from a large cratering event which did not disrupt the parent body (e.g. the [[Vesta family|Vesta]], [[Pallas family|Pallas]], [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]], and [[Massalia family|Massalia]] families). Such ''cratering families'' typically consist of a single large body and a swarm of asteroids that are much smaller. Some families (e.g. the [[Flora family]]) have complex internal structures which are not satisfactorily explained at the moment, but may be due to several collisions in the same region at different times.\n\nDue to the method of origin, all the members have closely matching compositions for most families. Notable exceptions are those families (such as the [[Vesta family]]) which formed from a large [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] parent body.\n\nAsteroid families are thought to have lifetimes of the order of a billion years, depending on various factors (e.g. smaller asteroids are lost faster). This is significantly shorter than the Solar System's age, so few if any are relics of the early Solar System. Decay of families occurs both because of slow dissipation of the orbits due to perturbations from Jupiter or other large bodies, and because of collisions between asteroids which grind them down to small bodies. Such small asteroids then become subject to perturbations such as the [[Yarkovsky effect]] that can push them towards [[orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter over time. Once there, they are relatively rapidly ejected from the asteroid belt. Tentative age estimates have been obtained for some families, ranging from hundreds of millions of years to less than several million years as for the compact [[Karin family]]. Old families are thought to contain few small members, and this is the basis of the age determinations.\n\nIt is supposed that many very old families have lost all the smaller and medium-sized members, leaving only a few of the largest intact. A suggested example of such old family remains are the [[9 Metis]] and [[113 Amalthea]] pair. Further evidence for a large number of past families (now dispersed) comes from analysis of chemical ratios in [[iron meteorite]]s. These show that there must have once been at least 50 to 100 parent bodies large enough to be differentiated, that have since been shattered to expose their cores and produce the actual meteorites (Kelley & Gaffey 2000).\n\n== {{anchor|Interloper|Background asteroid}} Identification of members, interlopers and background asteroids ==\n{{Redirect|Interloper (asteroid)|other meanings of Interloper|Interloper (disambiguation){{!}}Interloper}}\n\nWhen the [[orbital element]]s of [[main belt]] asteroids are plotted (typically [[inclination]] vs. [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], or vs. [[semi-major axis]]), a number of distinct concentrations are seen against the rather uniform distribution of non-family '''background asteroids'''. These concentrations are the asteroid families ''(see [[#top|above]])''. '''Interlopers''' are asteroids classified as family members based on their so-called [[proper orbital elements]] but having spectroscopic properties distinct from the bulk of the family, suggesting that they, contrary to the true family members, did not originate from the same [[parent body]] that once fragmented upon a collisional impact.\n\n=== Description ===\n[[File:Asteroid osculating vs proper elements.png|thumb|350px|Comparison: [[osculating orbit|osculating]] Keplerian [[orbital elements]] on the left (families indistinguishable) vs. [[proper orbital elements|proper elements]] on the right (families visible).]]\n\nStrictly speaking, families and their membership are identified by analysing the proper orbital elements rather than the current [[osculating orbit|osculating]] [[orbital elements]], which regularly fluctuate on timescales of tens of thousands of years. The ''proper elements'' are related constants of motion that remain almost constant for times of at least tens of millions of years, and perhaps longer.\n\nThe [[Japan]]ese [[astronomer]] [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] (1874\u20131943) pioneered the estimation of proper elements for asteroids, and first identified several of the most prominent families in 1918. In his honor, asteroid families are sometimes called [[Hirayama families]]. This particularly applies to the five prominent groupings discovered by him.\n\n==== {{anchor|Hierarchical Clustering Method}} Hierarchical clustering method ====\n{{Further|Hierarchical clustering}}\n\nPresent day computer-assisted searches have identified [[#finlist|more than a hundred asteroid families]]. The most prominent algorithms have been the '''hierarchical clustering method''' ('''HCM'''), which looks for groupings with small nearest-neighbour distances in orbital element space, and wavelet analysis, which builds a density-of-asteroids map in orbital element space, and looks for density peaks.\n\nThe boundaries of the families are somewhat vague because at the edges they blend into the background density of asteroids in the main belt. For this reason the number of members even among discovered asteroids is usually only known approximately, and membership is uncertain for asteroids near the edges.\n\nAdditionally, some interlopers from the [[heterogeneous]] background asteroid population are expected even in the central regions of a family. Since the true family members caused by the collision are expected to have similar compositions, most such interlopers can in principle be recognised by spectral properties which do not match those of the bulk of family members. A prominent example is [[1 Ceres]], the largest asteroid, which is an interloper in the family once named after it (the [[Ceres family]], now the [[Gefion family]]).\n\nSpectral characteristics can also be used to determine the membership (or otherwise) of asteroids in the outer regions of a family, as has been used e.g. for the [[Vesta family]], whose members have an unusual composition.\n\n==Family types==\n\nAs previously mentioned, families caused by an impact that did not disrupt the parent body but only ejected fragments are called ''cratering families''. Other terminology has been used to distinguish various types of groups which are less distinct or less statistically certain from the most prominent \"nominal families\" (or ''clusters'').\n\n=== Clusters, clumps, clans and tribes ===\n\nThe term ''cluster'' is also used to describe a small asteroid family, such as the [[Karin Cluster|Karin cluster]].<ref name=\"Nesvorn\u00fdEnke2006\">David Nesvorn\u00fd, Brian L. Enke, William F. Bottke, Daniel D. Durda, Erik Ashaug & Derek C. Richardson ''Karin cluster formation by asteroid impact'', Icarus '''183''', (2006) pp 296-311.</ref> ''Clumps'' are groupings which have relatively few members but are clearly distinct from the background (e.g. the [[Juno clump]]). ''Clans'' are groupings which merge very gradually into the background density and/or have a complex internal structure making it difficult to decide whether they are one complex group or several unrelated overlapping groups (e.g. the [[Flora family]] has been called a clan). ''Tribes'' are groups that are less certain to be statistically significant against the background either because of small density or large uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the members.\n\n== {{anchor|List of asteroid families}} List ==\n\n=== Prominent families ===\n<!-- pie chart advanced -->\n{{Image frame\n |width = 252\n |align = right\n |pos = bottom\n |content =<div style=\"background-color: #F9F9F9; font-size: 0.85em; text-align: left; padding: 8px 0; margin: 0;\">\n {{#invoke:Chart\n  |pie chart\n  |radius = 125\n  |slices = \n    ( 19073 : Nysa : pink : [[Nysa family]])\n    ( 15252 : Vesta : purple : [[Vesta family]])\n    ( 13786 : Flora : #B2F368 : [[Flora family]])\n    ( 9789 : Eos : #3D81FF : [[Eos family]])\n    ( 5949 : Koronis : #FFFF00 : [[Koronis family]])\n    ( 5670 : Eunomia : #FF2600 : [[Eunomia family]])\n    ( 4854 : Hygiea : #008B00 : [[Hygiea family]])\n    ( 4782 : Themis : #00CCCC : [[Themis family]])\n    ( 2965 : Hungaria : #FFA500 : [[Hungaria family]])\n    ( 21500 : All other families : #e2e2e2 : [[Asteroid family#All families]])\n    ( 295000: Background : #333333 : [[Asteroid belt]])\n  |units suffix = \n  |percent = true\n  }}</div>\n |caption= Distribution of the most prominent families, other families and [[background asteroid]]s (up to number 398,000)<ref name=\"Nesvorny-2014\" />{{rp|23}}\n}}\n\nAmong the many asteroid families, the [[Eos family|Eos]], [[Eunomia family|Eunomia]], [[Flora family|Flora]], [[Hungaria family|Hungaria]], [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]], [[Koronis family|Koronis]], [[Nysa family|Nysa]], [[Themis family|Themis]] and [[Vesta family|Vesta]] families are the most prominent ones in the [[asteroid belt]].

The members of the families are thought to be [[Collisional family|fragments of past asteroid collisions]].  An asteroid family is a more specific term than [[list of minor-planet groups|asteroid group]] whose members, while sharing some broad orbital characteristics, may be otherwise unrelated to each other.\n\n==General properties==\n[[Image:Asteroid proper elements i vs e.png|thumb|300px|Plot of [[proper orbital elements|proper]] [[inclination]] vs. [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] for numbered asteroids.]]\n\nLarge prominent families contain several hundred recognized asteroids (and many more smaller objects which may be either not-yet-analyzed, or not-yet-discovered). Small, compact families may have only about ten identified members. About 33% to 35% of asteroids in the main belt are family members.\n\nThere are about 20 to 30 reliably recognized families, with several tens of less certain groupings. Most asteroid families are found in the [[main belt|main asteroid belt]], although several family-like groups such as the [[Pallas family]], [[Hungaria family]], and the [[Phocaea family]] lie at smaller [[semi-major axis]] or larger inclination than the main belt.\n\n[[Haumea family|One family]] has been identified associated with the [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.<ref name=\"BrownBarkume2007\">[[Michael E. Brown]], Kristina M. Barkume, Darin Ragozzine & Emily L. Schaller, ''A collisional family of icy objects in the Kuiper belt'', Nature, '''446''', (March 2007), pp 294-296.</ref> Some studies have tried to find evidence of collisional families among the [[trojan asteroid]]s, but at present the evidence is inconclusive.\n\n==Origin and evolution==\nThe families are thought to form as a result of collisions between asteroids. In many or most cases the parent body was shattered, but there are also several families which resulted from a large cratering event which did not disrupt the parent body (e.g. the [[Vesta family|Vesta]], [[Pallas family|Pallas]], [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]], and [[Massalia family|Massalia]] families). Such ''cratering families'' typically consist of a single large body and a swarm of asteroids that are much smaller. Some families (e.g. the [[Flora family]]) have complex internal structures which are not satisfactorily explained at the moment, but may be due to several collisions in the same region at different times.\n\nDue to the method of origin, all the members have closely matching compositions for most families. Notable exceptions are those families (such as the [[Vesta family]]) which formed from a large [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] parent body.\n\nAsteroid families are thought to have lifetimes of the order of a billion years, depending on various factors (e.g. smaller asteroids are lost faster). This is significantly shorter than the Solar System's age, so few if any are relics of the early Solar System. Decay of families occurs both because of slow dissipation of the orbits due to perturbations from Jupiter or other large bodies, and because of collisions between asteroids which grind them down to small bodies. Such small asteroids then become subject to perturbations such as the [[Yarkovsky effect]] that can push them towards [[orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter over time. Once there, they are relatively rapidly ejected from the asteroid belt. Tentative age estimates have been obtained for some families, ranging from hundreds of millions of years to less than several million years as for the compact [[Karin family]]. Old families are thought to contain few small members, and this is the basis of the age determinations.\n\nIt is supposed that many very old families have lost all the smaller and medium-sized members, leaving only a few of the largest intact. A suggested example of such old family remains are the [[9 Metis]] and [[113 Amalthea]] pair. Further evidence for a large number of past families (now dispersed) comes from analysis of chemical ratios in [[iron meteorite]]s. These show that there must have once been at least 50 to 100 parent bodies large enough to be differentiated, that have since been shattered to expose their cores and produce the actual meteorites (Kelley & Gaffey 2000).\n\n== {{anchor|Interloper|Background asteroid}} Identification of members, interlopers and background asteroids ==\n{{Redirect|Interloper (asteroid)|other meanings of Interloper|Interloper (disambiguation){{!}}Interloper}}\n\nWhen the [[orbital element]]s of [[main belt]] asteroids are plotted (typically [[inclination]] vs. [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], or vs. [[semi-major axis]]), a number of distinct concentrations are seen against the rather uniform distribution of non-family '''background asteroids'''. These concentrations are the asteroid families ''(see [[#top|above]])''. '''Interlopers''' are asteroids classified as family members based on their so-called [[proper orbital elements]] but having spectroscopic properties distinct from the bulk of the family, suggesting that they, contrary to the true family members, did not originate from the same [[parent body]] that once fragmented upon a collisional impact.\n\n=== Description ===\n[[File:Asteroid osculating vs proper elements.png|thumb|350px|Comparison: [[osculating orbit|osculating]] Keplerian [[orbital elements]] on the left (families indistinguishable) vs. [[proper orbital elements|proper elements]] on the right (families visible).]]\n\nStrictly speaking, families and their membership are identified by analysing the proper orbital elements rather than the current [[osculating orbit|osculating]] [[orbital elements]], which regularly fluctuate on timescales of tens of thousands of years. The ''proper elements'' are related constants of motion that remain almost constant for times of at least tens of millions of years, and perhaps longer.\n\nThe [[Japan]]ese [[astronomer]] [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] (1874\u20131943) pioneered the estimation of proper elements for asteroids, and first identified several of the most prominent families in 1918. In his honor, asteroid families are sometimes called [[Hirayama families]]. This particularly applies to the five prominent groupings discovered by him.\n\n==== {{anchor|Hierarchical Clustering Method}} Hierarchical clustering method ====\n{{Further|Hierarchical clustering}}\n\nPresent day computer-assisted searches have identified [[#finlist|more than a hundred asteroid families]]. The most prominent algorithms have been the '''hierarchical clustering method''' ('''HCM'''), which looks for groupings with small nearest-neighbour distances in orbital element space, and wavelet analysis, which builds a density-of-asteroids map in orbital element space, and looks for density peaks.\n\nThe boundaries of the families are somewhat vague because at the edges they blend into the background density of asteroids in the main belt. For this reason the number of members even among discovered asteroids is usually only known approximately, and membership is uncertain for asteroids near the edges.\n\nAdditionally, some interlopers from the [[heterogeneous]] background asteroid population are expected even in the central regions of a family. Since the true family members caused by the collision are expected to have similar compositions, most such interlopers can in principle be recognised by spectral properties which do not match those of the bulk of family members. A prominent example is [[1 Ceres]], the largest asteroid, which is an interloper in the family once named after it (the [[Ceres family]], now the [[Gefion family]]).\n\nSpectral characteristics can also be used to determine the membership (or otherwise) of asteroids in the outer regions of a family, as has been used e.g. for the [[Vesta family]], whose members have an unusual composition.\n\n==Family types==\n\nAs previously mentioned, families caused by an impact that did not disrupt the parent body but only ejected fragments are called ''cratering families''. Other terminology has been used to distinguish various types of groups which are less distinct or less statistically certain from the most prominent \"nominal families\" (or ''clusters'').\n\n=== Clusters, clumps, clans and tribes ===\n\nThe term ''cluster'' is also used to describe a small asteroid family, such as the [[Karin Cluster|Karin cluster]].<ref name=\"Nesvorn\u00fdEnke2006\">David Nesvorn\u00fd, Brian L. Enke, William F. Bottke, Daniel D. Durda, Erik Ashaug & Derek C. Richardson ''Karin cluster formation by asteroid impact'', Icarus '''183''', (2006) pp 296-311.</ref> ''Clumps'' are groupings which have relatively few members but are clearly distinct from the background (e.g. the [[Juno clump]]). ''Clans'' are groupings which merge very gradually into the background density and/or have a complex internal structure making it difficult to decide whether they are one complex group or several unrelated overlapping groups (e.g. the [[Flora family]] has been called a clan). ''Tribes'' are groups that are less certain to be statistically significant against the background either because of small density or large uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the members.\n\n== {{anchor|List of asteroid families}} List ==\n\n=== Prominent families ===\n<!-- pie chart advanced -->\n{{Image frame\n |width = 252\n |align = right\n |pos = bottom\n |content =<div style=\"background-color: #F9F9F9; font-size: 0.85em; text-align: left; padding: 8px 0; margin: 0;\">\n {{#invoke:Chart\n  |pie chart\n  |radius = 125\n  |slices = \n    ( 19073 : Nysa : pink : [[Nysa family]])\n    ( 15252 : Vesta : purple : [[Vesta family]])\n    ( 13786 : Flora : #B2F368 : [[Flora family]])\n    ( 9789 : Eos : #3D81FF : [[Eos family]])\n    ( 5949 : Koronis : #FFFF00 : [[Koronis family]])\n    ( 5670 : Eunomia : #FF2600 : [[Eunomia family]])\n    ( 4854 : Hygiea : #008B00 : [[Hygiea family]])\n    ( 4782 : Themis : #00CCCC : [[Themis family]])\n    ( 2965 : Hungaria : #FFA500 : [[Hungaria family]])\n    ( 21500 : All other families : #e2e2e2 : [[Asteroid family#All families]])\n    ( 295000: Background : #333333 : [[Asteroid belt]])\n  |units suffix = \n  |percent = true\n  }}</div>\n |caption= Distribution of the most prominent families, other families and [[background asteroid]]s (up to number 398,000)<ref name=\"Nesvorny-2014\" />{{rp|23}}\n}}\n\nAmong the many asteroid families, the [[Eos family|Eos]], [[Eunomia family|Eunomia]], [[Flora family|Flora]], [[Hungaria family|Hungaria]], [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]], [[Koronis family|Koronis]], [[Nysa family|Nysa]], [[Themis family|Themis]] and [[Vesta family|Vesta]] families are the most prominent ones in the [[asteroid belt]].
