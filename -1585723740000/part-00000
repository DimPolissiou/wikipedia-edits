[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] in 1606. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, [[Torres Strait]] islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain and returned with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in Sydney), [[New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

At the same time, some settlers were quite aware they were usurping the Aborigines place in Australia. In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory. ''An Historical Narrative of the Discovery of New Holland and New South Wales'', published in November 1786, contained \"A General Chart of New Holland, including New South Wales & Botany Bay, with The Adjacent Countries, and New Discovered Islands\", which showed all the territory claimed under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales.<ref>Robert J.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters.

From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. The first [[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the [[Protectionist Party]] over the [[Free Trade Party]] with the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) polling third.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close.

The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] in 1606. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, [[Torres Strait]] islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain and returned with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in Sydney), [[New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

Some researchers argue that the smallpox was acquired through contact with Indonesian fishermen in the far north and then spread across the continent, reaching the Sydney area in 1789.<ref>Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 \u2013 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, Foreword & pp 55, 61, 73\u201374, 181</ref><ref>Macknight, C.

At the same time, some settlers were quite aware they were usurping the Aborigines place in Australia. In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory. ''An Historical Narrative of the Discovery of New Holland and New South Wales'', published in November 1786, contained \"A General Chart of New Holland, including New South Wales & Botany Bay, with The Adjacent Countries, and New Discovered Islands\", which showed all the territory claimed under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales.<ref>Robert J.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages.

The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".
