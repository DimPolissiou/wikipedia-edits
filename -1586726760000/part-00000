He spoofed his style comedy in the opener by convincing Lorne Michaels he was fit for performance by divebombing Michaels' desk. In actuality, Farley had strained his vocal cords during performance and his exhaustion was so noticeable the producers nearly recommended cancelling his appearance. Farley's hosting had been considered so troublesome to the cast and crew that it was decided to be pulled from general circulation from general syndication as well as the SNL seasonal streaming, a decision only shared with [[Steven Seagal]]'s hosting.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Shales|first2=James Andrew|last2=Miller|title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live|publisher=Back Bay|location=New York City|year=2003|pages=492\u201393|isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281398,00.html|title=The Last Temptation of Chris|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, [[John P.

He made a guest appearance on [[Nickelodeon]]'s childrens' sketch comedy show ''All That'', doing a sketch alongside future SNL cast member [[Kenan Thompson]]. The appearance proceeded without incident, but the stunt comedy Farley was famous for was minimal, arguably because it was noticeable Farley was wheezing heavily and straining himself to perform. On October 25th, 1997, Farley made his final appearance on Saturday Night Live and only time he hosted the show. Farley's hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny. He spoofed his style comedy in the opener by convincing Lorne Michaels he was fit for performance by divebombing Michaels' desk. In actuality, Farley had strained his vocal cords during performance and his exhaustion was so noticeable the producers nearly recommended cancelling his appearance. Farley's hosting had been considered so troublesome to the cast and crew that it was decided to be pulled from general circulation from general syndication as well as the SNL seasonal streaming, a decision only shared with [[Steven Seagal]]'s hosting.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Shales|first2=James Andrew|last2=Miller|title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live|publisher=Back Bay|location=New York City|year=2003|pages=492\u201393|isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281398,00.html|title=The Last Temptation of Chris|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, [[John P.

In [[Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and [[centre-right politics]].\n\n==Overview, definitions and usage==\nBoth \"[[conservatism]]\" and \"[[liberalism]]\" have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term \"liberal conservatism\" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with \"[[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] conservatism\", which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), the term \"liberal conservatism\" came to be understood simply as \"conservatism\" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values to call themselves \"[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]\" instead.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.</ref> However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.{{sfn|van de Haar|2015|p=71}}\n\nNevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112</ref> However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a \"hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism\") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9780241958896}}</ref> Consequently, in the United States the term \"liberal conservatism\" is not used. American \"[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]\" happens to be quite different from [[Liberalism in Europe|European liberalism]] and occupies the [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centrism|centre]] and [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] while [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.<ref>Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nFor their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding [[national conservatism|national conservative]], fully [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] and/or outright [[populism|populist]] views, let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} Compared to other centre-right political traditions, such as [[Christian democracy]], liberal conservatives are less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome regional varieties and peculiarities can be observed:\n* In much of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, as well as the United Kingdom and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberal conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals (including [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberals]]).\n* In most [[Nordic countries]], liberal conservatives, Christian democrats and liberals form distinct political families and have each their own party.\n* In most countries where [[Romance languages]] are spoken and where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is or has been dominant, as well as in [[Greece]], liberal conservative movements, often encompassing Christian democrats and liberals,  have more recently gained traction and the terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" may be understood as synonymous.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nConsequently, at the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party).\n\nIn this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] in Belgium, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] in [[Austria]]) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] in Greece, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] in [[Portugal]], [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in [[Spain]], [[Forza Italia]] / [[The People of Freedom]] / [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] in [[Italy]], the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] / [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in [[France]] and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]]) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.\n\nIn the modern European discourse, \"liberal conservatism\" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and [[environmentalism]] (see also [[green conservatism]] and [[green liberalism]]). This variety of \"liberal conservatism\" has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats, and, at times, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010, [[David Cameron]] introduced himself a \"liberal conservative\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=2010-05-16}}</ref> During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of \"grand schemes to remake the world\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm \"Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference\"], BBC, October 2006</ref>\n\n==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]\nHistorically, in the 18th and 19th centuries \"[[conservatism]]\" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous \"[[liberalism]]\" \u2013 now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] \u2013 advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].\n\n[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]\nAccording to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is \"economics is prior to politics\".<ref name=vincent>{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],<ref>Lakoff, Sandoff, \"Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism.\" ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435\u2013464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}</ref> as the basis of current liberal conservatism, as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]]. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] \u2013 without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term \"liberal\" is used to describe those with free market economic views.

ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on economic, social and ethical issues,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}</ref> or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.\n\nLiberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the [[Market (economics)|market]] and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} They also support [[civil liberties]], along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions. In [[Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and [[centre-right politics]].\n\n==Overview, definitions and usage==\nBoth \"[[conservatism]]\" and \"[[liberalism]]\" have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term \"liberal conservatism\" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with \"[[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] conservatism\", which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), the term \"liberal conservatism\" came to be understood simply as \"conservatism\" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values to call themselves \"[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]\" instead.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.</ref> However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.{{sfn|van de Haar|2015|p=71}}\n\nNevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112</ref> However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a \"hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism\") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9780241958896}}</ref> Consequently, in the United States the term \"liberal conservatism\" is not used. American \"[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]\" happens to be quite different from [[Liberalism in Europe|European liberalism]] and occupies the [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centrism|centre]] and [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] while [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.<ref>Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nFor their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding [[national conservatism|national conservative]], fully [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] and/or outright [[populism|populist]] views, let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} Compared to other centre-right political traditions, such as [[Christian democracy]], liberal conservatives are less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome regional varieties and peculiarities can be observed:\n* In much of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, as well as the United Kingdom and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberal conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals (including [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberals]]).\n* In most [[Nordic countries]], liberal conservatives, Christian democrats and liberals form distinct political families and have each their own party.\n* In most countries where [[Romance languages]] are spoken and where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is or has been dominant, as well as in [[Greece]], liberal conservative movements, often encompassing Christian democrats and liberals,  have more recently gained traction and the terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" may be understood as synonymous.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nConsequently, at the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party).\n\nIn this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] in Belgium, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] in [[Austria]]) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] in Greece, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] in [[Portugal]], [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in [[Spain]], [[Forza Italia]] / [[The People of Freedom]] / [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] in [[Italy]], the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] / [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in [[France]] and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]]) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.\n\nIn the modern European discourse, \"liberal conservatism\" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and [[environmentalism]] (see also [[green conservatism]] and [[green liberalism]]). This variety of \"liberal conservatism\" has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats, and, at times, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010, [[David Cameron]] introduced himself a \"liberal conservative\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=2010-05-16}}</ref> During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of \"grand schemes to remake the world\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm \"Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference\"], BBC, October 2006</ref>\n\n==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]\nHistorically, in the 18th and 19th centuries \"[[conservatism]]\" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous \"[[liberalism]]\" \u2013 now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] \u2013 advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].\n\n[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]\nAccording to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is \"economics is prior to politics\".<ref name=vincent>{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],<ref>Lakoff, Sandoff, \"Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism.\" ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435\u2013464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}</ref> as the basis of current liberal conservatism, as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]]. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] \u2013 without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term \"liberal\" is used to describe those with free market economic views.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe coastal Habr Awal (mainly the Reer Ahmed Nuh) regularly acted as brokers/middlemen for the Somali clans of the interior who wished to take their goods to the ports of Berbera and Bulhar:\n\n<blockquote>The custom is for the Ayal Achmet (Berbera tribe) to act as brokers, and too often most of the profits stick to the hands of the middleman. Till lately no Ogadayn ever went to the coast, but entrusted the goods to coast traders.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Dublin Review, Volume 98|date=1886|pages=176|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued a to have a lucrative trading agreement with their foreign contacts, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Habr Awal Commanders carried out many successful operations that led to the decisive victory of the group and to the downfall of the Siad Barre regime.\n\nIn western Somaliland, this group was prominently represented in the 99 division of the [[Somali National Movement]] which was founded in [[Gabiley]] with the majority of the divisions troops consisting of militia fighters hailing from the Jibril Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal that dominates the [[Gabiley]] region. The 99 division was Commanded by General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) of the Jibril Abokor who successfully conquered [[Awdal]] region and completely erased the presence of [[Somali National Army]] forces within [[Gabiley]] and [[Awdal]] and forced the local [[Gadabursi]] inhabitants of [[Awdal]] to pledge loyalty to [[Somaliland]]. As commander of the 99 division, General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) also established a [[Somali National Movement]] military base in [[Zeila]] where the [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] occupied the Awdal region for 4 years and successfully defeated attempts by USF militia forces loyal to [[Djibouti]] who tried to take advantage of the fall of Siad Barre's [[Military Junta]] in 1991 and annex the city of [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lAyeNqKK7bQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jibril+abokor+militia#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Hassan Ali Jama, Who cares about Somalia |isbn= 9783899300758 |last1= Jama |first1= Hassan Ali |year= 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn central Somaliland, [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] and his Hussein Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal successfully liberated [[Hargeisa]] from the brutal communist regime and played a preeminent role for the SNM where they liberated [[Hargeisa]], and [[Faraweyne]].

The first division is between those lineages descended from sons of Sheikh Ishaaq by a [[Harari people|Harari]] woman \u2013 the Habr Habuusheed \u2013 and those descended from sons of Sheikh Ishaaq by a [[Somali people|Somali]] woman of the Magaadle sub-clan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] \u2013 the Habr Magaadle.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe.
