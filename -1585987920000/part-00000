She grew up on her grandparents' farm and attended a one-room country school. She was a senior at the [[University of Michigan]] when she wrote a novel-length story for an English composition class that won the 1940 [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood Award]], a university prize for excellent writing, worth $1,000. ''[[Whistle Stop (novel)|Whistle Stop]]'' is a seamy tale of the Veeches, a shiftless family living in a [[whistle stop|whistle-stop town]] near [[Detroit]].  The novel, depicting incest, violence, and containing much more vulgar language than was usual at the time, was published the next year by [[Random House]].  That Wolff, a mere 22-year-old, was the author of so hard-boiled a novel gave her an instant notoriety, and ''Whistle Stop'' became an immediate best-seller, going into five editions and a special [[Armed Services Edition]].  Yet the book was not without literary merit, [[Sinclair Lewis]] calling it \"the most important novel of the year.\"\n\n''[[Whistle Stop (film)|Whistle Stop]]'' was adapted into a 1946 film starring [[Ava Gardner]] and [[George Raft]].\n\nWolff's second novel, ''[[Night Shift (novel)|Night Shift]]'', attracted more critical praise, especially for its dialog.  It was made into a movie in 1947 starring [[Ida Lupino]] and [[Robert Alda]], with the title changed to [[The Man I Love (1947 film)|The Man I Love]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038721/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm</ref> Over the next 20 years she wrote four more best-selling novels.  Always a private person who shunned publicity, Wolff, in 1972, refused her publisher's request to go on a promotional tour for a recently finished novel, ''[[Sudden Rain]]'', and as a result the novel was never published during her lifetime.  At that point she evidently ceased writing fiction.\n\nWhile at the University of Michigan she had met and married a prolific young writer, [[Hubert Skidmore]], who published six novels before he was 30. Skidmore died in a house fire in 1946.  In 1947 Wolff married a [[costume jewelry|costume jeweller]], Leonard Stegman, by whom she had a son, Hugh Stegman.\n\nAfter Wolff's death, the manuscript for ''Sudden Rain'', which had been kept safely in her refrigerator for the last thirty years of her life, was published (along with re-issues of ''Whistle Stop'' and ''Night Shift'') to much acclaim.\n\n==Publications==\n*''[[Whistle Stop (novel)|Whistle Stop]]'' (Random House, N.Y.C., 1941).

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year.

The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election.

In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]].

According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = | footer_align = left | image1 = Boles\u0142aw Chrobry.PNG | width1 = 172 | caption1  =[[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], [[Civitas Schinesghe|Duke of Poland]] from 992 to 1025, first [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|King of Poland]] (only for two month in 1025), 19th century illustration by [[Aleksander Lesser]]| image2 = Mieszko II by Aleksander Lesser.PNG| width2 = 172 | caption2  = [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II]], son of Boles\u0142aw, [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|King of Poland]] from 1025 to 1031, Duke from 1032 until his early death in 1034; [[Aleksander Lesser|Lesser]] 1860}}\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n[[File:Yaroslav I of Russia (Granovitaya palata, 1881-2).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yaroslav the Wise]] in the [[Palace of Facets]], Moscow]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] of the [[Piast dynasty]] repeatedly clashed with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars of 1002 to 1018]].

The Empire and Poland endured peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Boles\u0142aw seized the opportunity of Henry's death in 1024 to disregard all peace agreements and consolidate his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself King at [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors only held the ducal title of the political entity, so far called [[Civitas Schinesghe]], that had only a few decades ago revealed itself to the world and the [[Holy See]] in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25779841?seq=1  |title= \"DAGOME IUDEX\" AND THE FIRST CONFLICT OVER SUCCESSION IN POLAND  | publisher = Jstor |date=   |author=KRYSTYNA \u0141UKASIEWICZ    |accessdate= April 3, 2020  }}</ref> Boles\u0142aw died within two months of his coronation, most likely due to an illness.

In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could deploy his forces. In preparation for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay beyond the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad at his imperial coronation in 1027, and Conrad granted Cnut the authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\n{{main|Germania Slavica}}\nFearing the scenario of a joint German-Danish attack, in 1028 Mieszko took the initiative and invaded [[March of Lusatia|Lusatia]] in the eastern Empire and occupied the territories of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]], where [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes had settled and represented the majority of the population since the 10th century after centuries of steady immigration. Slavs had long been the target of imperial military campaigns, particularly for the punishment and subjugation of [[paganism|pagan]] tribes. During the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subdued and harassed Slavic settlers beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Slavic revolt of 983]], the Lutici rose in an open rebellion. In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland and the Empire.

Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace.

Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland.

Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the sensible title ''\"king\"'' in favor of the traditional title ''\"duke\"'' and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/102/4/1140/80981?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title= Medieval Russia 980\u20131584  |publisher= Oxford University Press | date= October 1, 1997 | author=Janet Martin    | accessdate= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBezprym's reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe regulation was short-lived as in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took over the domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to the Empire.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0422-0|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by emperor Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]].

Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans.

By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role and [[Imperial Church System|organisation of the Church]] and the status and affairs of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election.

In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]].

According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction.

Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = | footer_align = left | image1 = Boles\u0142aw Chrobry.PNG | width1 = 172 | caption1  =[[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], [[Civitas Schinesghe|Duke of Poland]] from 992 to 1025, first [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|King of Poland]] (only for two month in 1025), 19th century illustration by [[Aleksander Lesser]]| image2 = Mieszko II by Aleksander Lesser.PNG| width2 = 172 | caption2  = [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II]], son of Boles\u0142aw, [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|King of Poland]] from 1025 to 1031, Duke from 1032 until his early death in 1034; [[Aleksander Lesser|Lesser]] 1860}}\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n[[File:Yaroslav I of Russia (Granovitaya palata, 1881-2).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yaroslav the Wise]] in the [[Palace of Facets]], Moscow]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] of the [[Piast dynasty]] repeatedly clashed with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars of 1002 to 1018]].

The Empire and Poland endured peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Boles\u0142aw seized the opportunity of Henry's death in 1024 to disregard all peace agreements and consolidate his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself King at [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors only held the ducal title of the political entity, so far called [[Civitas Schinesghe]], that had only a few decades ago revealed itself to the world and the [[Holy See]] in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25779841?seq=1  |title= \"DAGOME IUDEX\" AND THE FIRST CONFLICT OVER SUCCESSION IN POLAND  | publisher = Jstor |date=   |author=KRYSTYNA \u0141UKASIEWICZ    |accessdate= April 3, 2020  }}</ref> Boles\u0142aw died within two months of his coronation, most likely due to an illness.

In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to consolidate imperial authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could deploy his forces. In preparation for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay beyond the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad at his imperial coronation in 1027, and Conrad granted Cnut the authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\n{{main|Germania Slavica}}\nFearing the scenario of a joint German-Danish attack, in 1028 Mieszko took the initiative and invaded [[March of Lusatia|Lusatia]] in the eastern Empire and occupied the territories of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]], where [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes had settled and represented the majority of the population since the 10th century after centuries of steady immigration. Slavs had long been the target of imperial military campaigns, particularly for the punishment and subjugation of [[paganism|pagan]] tribes. During the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subdued and harassed Slavic settlers beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici rose in an open rebellion. In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland and the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace.

Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege to the Polish held town of [[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko was crushed by the Holy Roman and Kievan invaders and his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]'s rebellion. He surrendered to Conrad in the fall 1031.

His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe regulation was short-lived as in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took over the domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to the Empire.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0422-0|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by emperor Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]].

In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.
