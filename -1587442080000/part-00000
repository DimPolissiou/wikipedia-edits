The chain was founded in 1927 as an [[ice house (building)|ice house]] storefront in Dallas. It was named '''Tote'm Stores''' between 1928 and 1946. After 70% of the company was acquired by Japanese affiliate [[Ito-Yokado]] in 1991, it was reorganized as a subsidiary of Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd in 2005, and is now held by [[Chiyoda, Tokyo]]-based [[Seven & I Holdings Co.|Seven & I Holdings Co., Ltd.]].<ref name=\"Plunkett 1\">{{cite book|title=Plunkett's Retail Industry Almanac 2009|last1=Plunkett|first1=Jack W.|date=December 2008|publisher=Plunkett Research, Ltd.}}</ref>\n\n7-Eleven operates, franchises, and licenses 68,236 stores in 17 countries as of June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sej.co.jp/company/en/g_stores.html |title= 7-Eleven around the world|website=Seven-Eleven Japan Co.

Some stores featured genuine Alaskan [[totem pole]]s in front of the store.

The pole served as a [[marketing tool]] for the company, as it attracted a great deal of attention. Soon, executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an [[Alaska Native]]-inspired theme for their stores. Later on, the stores began operating under the name \"Tote'm Stores\". In the same year, the company began constructing [[Gas station|gas stations]] in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment. Joe Thompson also provided a distinct characteristic to the company's stores, training the staff so that people would receive the same quality and service in every store. Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys. This became the major factor in the company's success as a retail convenience store.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1931, the [[Great Depression]] affected the company, sending it toward bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the company continued its operations through re-organization and [[receivership]]. A Dallas banker, W.W. Overton Jr., also helped to revive the company's finances by selling the company's bonds for seven cents on the dollar. This brought the company's ownership under the control of a board of directors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Press|first1=Hoover's Business|title=Hoover's Handbook of Private Companies|date=2010|publisher=Hoover's Business Press|page=209}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, in an effort to continue the company's [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|post-war]] recovery, the name of the franchise was changed to 7-Eleven to reflect the stores' new hours of operation (7&nbsp;am to 11&nbsp;pm), which were unprecedented at the time.

That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the Slurpee drink's [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] Application ([[Mobile app|App]]). The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and provides driving directions.

The number of stores reached 1,602 at the end of 2015. As of 2017, there are 2,285 7-Eleven stores all over the Philippines.\n\nStarting Oct 2019, 7-Eleven signed an agreement with Caltex to use the former as its convenience stores in its gas stations nationwide<ref>https://www.caltex.com/ph/about-us/news/2009/caltex-stations-offers-more-convenience-with-7-eleven-stores.html</ref>, thus rapidly increasing 7-Eleven  store chains count in a short span of time.\n\n==== Singapore ====\n\nIn Singapore, 7-Eleven forms the largest chain of [[convenience stores]] island-wide. There are 393 7-Eleven stores scattered throughout the country as of February 2018. Stores in Singapore are operated by [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]], franchised under a licensing agreement with 7-Eleven Incorporated. The first 7-Eleven store in Singapore was opened along Upper Changi Road in 1983, and in 1986 the first franchised 7-Eleven store (under the [[Jardine Matheson Group]]) was opened. The license was then acquired by [[Cold Storage (supermarket)|Cold Storage]] Singapore, a subsidiary of the [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm Group]], in 1989.\n\nIn 2006, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Singapore]] and 7-Eleven agreed to rebrand all 68 of its Shell Select convenience stores into 7-Eleven.

The first 7-Eleven store in Singapore was opened along Upper Changi Road in 1983, and in 1986 the first franchised 7-Eleven store (under the [[Jardine Matheson Group]]) was opened. The license was then acquired by [[Cold Storage (supermarket)|Cold Storage]] Singapore, a subsidiary of the [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm Group]], in 1989.\n\nIn 2006, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Singapore]] and 7-Eleven agreed to rebrand all 68 of its Shell Select convenience stores into 7-Eleven.

She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] 25 August 1941 and sponsored by Mrs. Genevieve G. Watson, wife of Rear Admiral Adolphus E Watson, Commandant of the 4th Naval District and the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|Philadelphia Navy Yard]].  The boat was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] 31 January 1942, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Jesse L. Hull]] ([[United States Naval Academy|Class]] of 1926) in command.\n\n==1942==\n\n===First and second patrols===\n''Finback'' reached [[Pearl Harbor]] from [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] 29 May 1942, and two days later, with the Japanese fleet on the move, was ordered out to patrol during the [[Battle of Midway]]. She returned to Pearl Harbor on June 9 to prepare for her first full war patrol. She cleared harbor, bound for the [[Aleutian Islands]], 25 June. ''Finback'' first contacted the enemy on 5 July, when she attacked two destroyers, and received a heavy return depth charge attack. Two special missions highlighted this first war patrol: a reconnaissance of [[Vega Bay]], [[Kiska]], 11 July, and a surveying operation at Tanaga Bay, Tanaga, 11 August. The submarine ended her patrol at [[Dutch Harbor]] 12 August, and returned to Pearl Harbor 23 August to refit.\n\nDeparting Pearl Harbor 23 September 1942, ''Finback'' made her second war patrol off [[Taiwan]]. On 14 October, she sighted a convoy of four merchantmen, guarded by a patrol vessel. The submarine launched two torpedoes at each of the two largest targets, sinking one, the (ex-French merchantman ''Ville De Verdun''), ''Teison Maru'', (7007 tons), returning empty to Japan, and went deep for the inevitable depth charging. When she surfaced, she found two destroyers in the area, preventing a further attack. With tubes reloaded, she headed for the China coast. Four days later, 18 October, she inflicted heavy damage on a large freighter, and on 20 October, ''Finback'' made contact with three ships, en route to Yokohama, Japan from Saigon; sinking the passenger-cargo ship; ''Africa Maru'', (9476 tons) carrying a cargo of rice and corn, 112 crewmen and 38 passengers including survivors of cargo ship ''Teibo Maru'' (4,472 tons) torpedoed and sunk on 25 September 1942 by [[USS Sargo (SS-188)]], and the cargo ship ''Yamafuji Maru'' (5359 tons).  The submarine completed this patrol with a surface gunfire engagement 3 November, sinking an ocean-going sampan. ''Finback'' returned to Pearl Harbor 20 November.\n\n==1943==\n\n===Third and fourth patrols===\nDuring her third war patrol, between 16 December 1942 and 6 February 1943, ''Finback'' served for some time as escort for a carrier task force, forbidden to reveal herself by making attacks during that part of the patrol. Later, she engaged the Japanese coaster ''Yachiyo Maru'' (271 tons) in a surface gun duel on 17 January, leaving the enemy craft abandoned and sinking.\n\nAfter refitting at [[Midway Atoll|Midway]], ''Finback'' made her fourth war patrol between 27 February and 13 April, scouting shipping lanes between [[Rabaul]] and the Japanese home islands. On 21 March, she damaged the troop transport ''Sanuki Maru'' (7158 tons), when one out of two torpedoes that hit the ship failed to explode, and from 24 \u2013 26 March made a difficult chase of a convoy. When in position to attack, she fired three torpedoes at each of two ships and was immediately fired upon, then forced deep by an efficient depth-charge attack. Almost out of fuel, ''Finback'' was forced to break off the contact, and set course for [[Wake Island]] and Midway. On 5 April, passing a reef south of Japanese-held Wake, ''Finback'' sighted the troop transport; ''[[Suwa Maru]]'' beached and well down by the stern. After manoeuvring ''Finback'' was able to elude a patrol boat and a searching airplane before torpedoing and sinking the 10672 ton ship previously damaged by two of ''Finback'''s sister submarines.\n\n===Fifth and sixth patrols===\n''Finback'' refitted at Pearl Harbor from 13 April to 12 May 1943 for her fifth war patrol. Through most of this patrol, she patrolled off Taiwan, and along the shipping lanes from the Japanese home islands to the Marshalls. On 27 May, she sank IJA cargo ship ''Kochi Maru'' (2910 tons), and the auxiliary minelayer ''Kahoku Maru'' (3277 tons) on 8 June. Another merchant vessel was sunk by ''Finback'' four days later.\n\nAfter refitting at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], 26 June \u2013 18 July, the submarine sailed for her sixth war patrol along the Java coast. Her first contact was made 30 July, and sank the IJA cargo ship ''Ryuzan Maru'' (4719 GRT) and another cargo ship on 3 August. On 11 August, ''Finback'' damaged the auxiliary minelayer ''Tatsumiya Maru'' (6343 tons). She encountered two small minelayers, a tug, and an inter-island steamer on 19 August, and engaged all but the tug with surface gunfire, damaging the auxiliary submarine chaser and sinking the ''Cha 109'' (75 tons, former Dutch patrol vessel ''Kawi'').  Her limited supply of ammunition forced her to break off the action.\n\n==1944==\n\n===Seventh and eighth patrols===\nAfter a major overhaul at Pearl Harbor between 12 September and 15 December 1943, ''Finback'' sailed for the South China Sea on her seventh war patrol, characterized by heavy weather, few contacts, and continual sighting of patrol planes. She sank the tanker ''Isshin Maru'' (10044 tons) in a surface attack on New Year's Day 1944, after the tanker was unable to keep up with its convoy due to a rudder malfunction. On 30 January, a fishing trawler was sunk by surface gunfire and another damaged in a similar action the following day.\n\nThe submarine refitted at Pearl Harbor once more between 11 February and 6 March 1944, then sailed for her eighth war patrol, off [[Chuuk State|Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]]. Prevented from launching attacks through most of this patrol because of her assignment as [[Lifeguard League|lifeguard]] for carrier air strikes on targets in the Carolines, ''Finback'' contacted a six-ship convoy on 12 April, noting three escorts. She attacked four of the ships before a counter-attack sent her deep. On 16 April, while making a reconnaissance of [[Oroluk Atoll]], she fired on a partially submerged steamer and a lookout tower on the atoll. Three days later, she sank one of a group of sampans, then sailed for refit at Pearl Harbor from 1 May \u2013 30 May.\n\n===Ninth, tenth and eleventh patrols===\nDuring her ninth war patrol, off the [[Palau]]s and west of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], ''Finback'' again had as her primary mission lifeguard duty during plane strikes covering the opening of the Marianas operation.\n[[File:George Bush being rescued by the submarine, the U.S.S.

On her eleventh war patrol, she was again detailed to lifeguard duty in the Bonins. She sank troop transport ''Jusan Maru'' (2111  tons), on 16 December, and returned to Midway 24 December.\n\n==1945==\n\n===Twelfth patrol===\nThe submarine's twelfth war patrol, made between 20 January and 25 March 1945 in the [[East China Sea]], was frustrated by lack of targets ''Finback'' returned to Pearl Harbor for a thorough overhaul. Still at Pearl Harbor at the close of the war, she sailed for New London 29 August 1945.\n\n==Post war==\nHomeported at New London for the remaining 5 years of her active career, ''Finback'' was engaged in training student submariners. Twice, in 1947 and in 1948, she sailed to the Caribbean to take part in [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]] exercises. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at New London 21 April 1950.\n\n''Finback'' was stricken on 1 September 1958, and sold for scrap 15 July 1959.\n\nAll but the third, ninth, and twelfth of ''Finback's'' 12 war patrols were designated \"Successful.\" She received 13 [[battle stars]] for World War II service, and is credited with having sunk 69,383&nbsp;tons of enemy shipping.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/f/finback.html}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/f2/finback.htm History.navy.mil: USS ''Finback'']\n* [http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08230.htm Navsource.org: USS ''Finback'']\n* [http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/submar/ss230.txt Hazegray.org: USS ''Finback'']\n\n{{Gato_class_submarine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Finback (SS-230)}}\n[[Category:Gato-class submarines]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cold War submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine]]\n[[Category:1941 ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{other ships|USS Finback}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=\n|Ship caption= Launch of USS ''Finback'' \n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1950}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], [[Kittery, Maine]]<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\">{{cite book\n  | last = Friedman\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = U.S. Submarines Through 1945: An Illustrated Design History\n  | publisher = [[United States Naval Institute]]\n  | year = 1995\n  | location = [[Annapolis, Maryland]]\n  | pages = 285\u2013304\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 1-55750-263-3 }}</ref>\n|Ship laid down=5 February 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship launched=25 August 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship sponsor=Mrs. A.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussel had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\" <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref> In the fist meeting with Ward, Trussell declined to join to a new project claiming he was too busy to turn his podcast into a animated show. In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion. <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref>\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the serie. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|first2=Denise|last2=Petski|date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like Johnny Pemberton, Brendon Walsh, Weird Al Yankovic and Emo Philips were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\nFor Ward, the new serie was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel.Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by Netflix, was released on April 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/the-midnight-gospel-review-1202224481/|title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: \u2018Adventure Time\u2019 Creator\u2019s Astonishing New Netflix Show|first1=Eric|last1=Kohn|first2=Eric|last2=Kohn|date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

The citizens of Linden, a small town with fewer than 2,000 people, 95 miles east of [[San Francisco]], were long aware of the duo's reputation as methamphetamine users. They were regulars at the Linden Inn, a bar owned by the father of 25-year-old Cyndi Vanderheiden of [[Clements, California]]. Vanderheiden went missing after leaving the Linden Inn with Herzog and Shermantine on November 14, 1998.\n\nInvestigation into Vanderheiden's disappearance was ongoing into 1999, and Shermantine was the prime suspect.  In mid-January 1999, Shermantine's car was repossessed, and was subsequently searched by the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]] Sheriff's Department. Blood identified as being from Cyndi Vanderheiden was discovered in the car, and while [[DNA]] test results were being confirmed, the sheriff's department focused on Loren Herzog, Shermantine's friend and suspected accomplice. He was extensively questioned.\n\nHerzog described when Shermantine shot a hunter they ran into while they were on vacation in Utah in 1994. Utah police confirmed that a hunter was shot to death, but his murder was still classified as unsolved.

They were regulars at the Linden Inn, a bar owned by the father of 25-year-old Cyndi Vanderheiden of [[Clements, California]]. Vanderheiden went missing after leaving the Linden Inn with Herzog and Shermantine on November 14, 1998.\n\nInvestigation into Vanderheiden's disappearance was ongoing into 1999, and Shermantine was the prime suspect.  In mid-January 1999, Shermantine's car was repossessed, and was subsequently searched by the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]] Sheriff's Department. Blood identified as being from Cyndi Vanderheiden was discovered in the car, and while [[DNA]] test results were being confirmed, the sheriff's department focused on Loren Herzog, Shermantine's friend and suspected accomplice. He was extensively questioned.\n\nHerzog described when Shermantine shot a hunter they ran into while they were on vacation in Utah in 1994.
