The Braves struck first when [[Lonnie Smith]] doubled to lead off the first off of [[Randy Tomlin]], moved to third on a line out, and scored on [[Ron Gant]]'s groundout, then three straight singles by [[David Justice]], [[Brian Hunter (first baseman)|Brian Hunter]] and [[Greg Olson (baseball)|Greg Olson]] made it 2\u20130 Braves. However, they would not score for the rest of the game. [[Don Slaught]]'s RBI single with two on in the second off of [[Charlie Leibrandt]] cut the lead to 2\u20131, then [[Gary Redus]] singled with two outs in the fifth and scored on a [[Jay Bell]] single along with a Braves error to tie the game.\n\nThe Pirates tied the series with a run in the top of the tenth when [[Mike LaValliere]], off of [[Mark Wohlers]], singled in [[Andy Van Slyke]], who had stolen second after being walked by [[Kent Mercker]]. [[Stan Belinda]] retired the Braves in order in the bottom of the inning.\n\n===Game 5===\nMonday, October 14, 1991 (3:08PM EDT) at [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''Pittsburgh'''|RoadAbr=PIT\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=1|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=1|RH=6|RE=2\n|Home=Atlanta|HomeAbr=ATL\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=0|HH=9|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Zane Smith]] (1\u20131)|LP=[[Tom Glavine]] (0\u20132)|SV=[[Roger Mason (baseball)|Roger Mason]] (1)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\n[[Zane Smith]] had his second excellent game of the Series, but this time he won, beating [[Tom Glavine]] and the Braves 1\u20130 in almost a mirror image of Smith's start in Game 2. However, in Game 2, Smith had given up the one run and lost.\n\nControversy surrounded this game when [[David Justice]] appeared to score on a single to left, but he seemed to miss third base and was called out on an appeal. Replays were inconclusive, but Justice did stumble over third base, and the umpires called him out, preserving Smith's shutout.\n\nThe lone run in this game came when [[Jos\u00e9 Lind]] hit a simple RBI single in the fifth.\n\n===Game 6===\nWednesday, October 16, 1991 (8:39PM EDT) at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''Atlanta'''|RoadAbr=ATL\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=1|RR=1|RH=7|RE=0\n|Home=Pittsburgh|HomeAbr=PIT\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=0|HH=4|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Steve Avery]] (2\u20130)|LP=[[Doug Drabek]] (1\u20131)|SV=[[Alejandro Pe\u00f1a]] (3)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nPittsburgh hosted one of the best pitcher's duels of all-time on October 16, 1991, between [[Steve Avery]] and [[Doug Drabek]]. In the end, identical to Avery's last start, a combination of Avery and [[Alejandro Pe\u00f1a]] shut out the Pirates for all nine innings. The Pirates only got four hits. However, this time the Braves didn't score a run all the way through eight innings. Drabek matched Avery, pitch for pitch. But in the ninth inning, with the score tied 0\u20130, [[Greg Olson (baseball)|Greg Olson]] raked a double down the left field line that scored [[Ron Gant]], who walked and stole second, and took the lead off a weary Drabek. He had pitched a [[complete game]], but was the loser after the Pirates could not get [[Gary Varsho]] home from third in the bottom of the ninth. The Braves had not scored a run since the first inning of Game 4, a futility streak that reached {{frac|26|2|3}} innings before Gant scored the winning run.\n\n===Game 7===\nThursday, October 17, 1991 (8:39PM EDT) at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''Atlanta'''|RoadAbr=ATL\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=1|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=4|RH=6|RE=1\n|Home=Pittsburgh|HomeAbr=PIT\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=0|HH=6|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[John Smoltz]] (2\u20130)|LP=[[John Smiley (baseball)|John Smiley]] (0\u20132)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Brian Hunter (first baseman)|Brian Hunter]] (1)|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe Braves scored three runs in the first inning on [[Ron Gant]]'s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third, followed by a [[Brian Hunter (first baseman)|Brian Hunter]] two-run home run, and never looked back. Twenty-game winner [[John Smiley (baseball)|John Smiley]] made the start, fared poorly, was yanked after two-thirds of an inning and lost to [[John Smoltz]], who shut out the Pirates. Although Bob Walk was masterful in middle relief, it was too little, too late, even though he pulled his groin trying to help his cause attempting to stretch a single into a double in the bottom of the seventh. Hunter's RBI double in the fifth with two on capped the scoring as the Braves won 4\u20130 and nabbed the pennant. After Atlanta had gone {{frac|26|2|3}} innings without scoring, the Pirates themselves went the final {{frac|22|1|3}} innings without scoring. That streak would reach 30 innings before [[Jos\u00e9 Lind]] snapped it with a home run in the eighth inning of Game 1 in the 1992 NLCS.\n\nAvery won the Series MVP award. Pitching 16{{frac|1|3}} innings, the Braves starter did not allow a run, giving up nine hits and walking four while striking out seventeen. Avery said, ''\"It's been the best time of my life.\"''\n\nThe Braves scored fourteen runs in the games Smiley pitched (Games 3 and 7), including nine off Smiley, but only five runs in the other five games combined. Smiley had been the Pirates' biggest winner in 1991, notching twenty victories for the only time in his career.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves' [[1991 World Series|World Series]] appearance was their first since [[1958 World Series|1958]], and their first since moving to Atlanta in 1966.  The Braves lost a memorable and dramatic seven-game series to the [[Minnesota Twins]].\n\n==Composite box==\n1991 NLCS '''(4\u20133): [[Atlanta Braves]]''' over [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[Atlanta Braves]]'''\n|R1=9|R2=1|R3=1|R4=0|R5=1|R6=1|R7=1|R8=3|R9=2|R10=0|RR=19|RH=53|RE=4\n|Home='''[[Pittsburgh Pirates]]'''\n|H1=2|H2=1|H3=2|H4=1|H5=2|H6=1|H7=1|H8=1|H9=0|H10=1|HR=12|HH=51|HE=6\n|TotalAttendance=369,443 |AveAttendance=52,778\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1991_NLCS.shtml 1991 NLCS at Baseball Reference]\n\n{{1991 MLB Playoffs navbox}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{NLCS}}\n{{Atlanta Braves}}\n{{Pittsburgh Pirates}}\n{{Major League Baseball on CBS}}\n{{Major League Baseball on CBS Radio}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:1991 Major League Baseball season|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:Atlanta Braves postseason]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Pirates postseason]]\n[[Category:1991 in sports in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:1991 in sports in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1991 in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:1990s in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:October 1991 sports events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toZane Smith(link changed toZane Smith (baseball); link changed toZane Smith (baseball); link changed toZane Smith (baseball); link changed toZane Smith (baseball)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_National_League_Championship_Series"}
