It was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 16 June 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Doctor Who UK airdate announced |work=News |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]] |date=27 February 2007 |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312164215/http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> It is the first of three episodes that form a linked narrative, followed by \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\". The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".

In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n\n===Cast Notes===\n\n* Since 2017, Jacobi has since reprised the role due to popular demand for several ''Doctor Who audio dramas'' for [[Big Finish Productions]] beginning with [[The War Master (audio drama series)|\"The War Master\"]].\n\n* [[John Simm]] reprised his role as the Master in the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s final story [[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|\"The End of Time\"]] and reprised the role again in [[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|\"World Enough and Time\"]] and [[The Doctor Falls|\"The Doctor Falls\"]], the finale of [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]], the final series to feature [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Michelle Gomez]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Missy]]\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]].

In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]].

This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n\n===Cast Notes===\n\n* Since 2017, Jacobi has since reprised the role due to popular demand for several Doctor Who audio dramas for Big Finish Productions beginning with [[The War Master (audio drama series)|\"The War Master\"]].\n\n* [[John Simm]] reprised his role as the Master in the Tenth Doctor's final story [[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|\"The End of Time\"]] and reprised the role again in [[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|\"World Enough and Time\"]] and [[The Doctor Falls|\"The Doctor Falls\"]], the finale of [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]], the final series to feature [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Michelle Gomez]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Missy]]\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

In the [[United States Congress]], the [[Vice President of the United States]] is the ''[[ex officio]]'' President of the [[United States Senate]].  In [[Massachusetts]], however, the President of the Senate is elected from and by the Senators. The President, therefore, typically comes from the majority party, and the President is then the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of that party.\n\nThe most recent President of the [[Massachusetts Senate]] was [[Harriette Chandler]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who served as acting President following Stan Rosenberg's decision in December 2017 to temporarily step down from his post while the Senate conducted investigations into allegations of sexual assault made against his husband, Bryon Hefner. Chandler moved from acting President to President of the Senate in February 2018.  She relinquished that post on 26 July 2018, and was succeeded by [[Karen Spilka]].

The new settlers cleared the woodland and cultivated the area for rice and sugar farming. Don \u00c1ngel built his first house with light materials at the northwest corner of the intersection of Sapang Balen and the road going towards the town of [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]].

Ten years later, on 11 February 1822, Don \u00c1ngel filed a petition for the township of Culiat to secede from San Fernando, but it was denied. This was followed by another petition within the same year, jointly signed by Don \u00c1ngel, his son-in-law, Mariano Henson, and the latter's father, Severino Henson. He donated 35 hectares for the construction of the first Catholic church, a convent and a primary school while Do\u00f1a Agustina Henson de Nepomuceno, the niece of who would become the first ''{{lang|es|gobernadorcillo}}'' of Angeles in 1830, Don Ciriaco de Miranda, gave land for the new public market. Don \u00c1ngel paid the complete amount required by law just for the secession of Culiat from San Fernando. There were only 160 taxpayers then but the law required that it should have at least 500 taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|title=General Tourist info Angeles City \u2013 Philippines|accessdate=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717020450/http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|archive-date=17 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLocated some {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Pampanga's capital, Culiat became a barrio of San Fernando for 33 years and on 8 December 1829, became a separate municipality. The newly-autonomous town was renamed \"{{lang|es|El Pueblo de los \u00c1ngeles}}\" in honor of its patron saints, the Holy Angels, and the name of its founder, Don \u00c1ngel, coinciding with the rise of new ''[[barangay|barrio]]s'' such as Santo Cristo (as the ''[[poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'' or town proper), Cutcut, Pampang and Pulong Anunas. The progressive barrios developed some new industries like a sugar mill and a wine distillery. The transition of Angeles from a jungle clearing to a barrio, to a town and finally to a city took 168 years and in all that time, it survived locusts' infestations, wars, epidemics, volcanic eruptions and typhoons to become one of the fast rising towns in the country.  When it received its first official municipal charter, the town contained some 661 people, 151 houses and an area of 38.65&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"TouristCenter\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.touristcenter.com.ph/philippines/information/angeles.html\n| title       = Tourist information and services on Angeles City Philippines\n| accessdate  = 2007-11-24\n| work        = Tourist Center\n| publisher   = Tourist Center Corporation Philippines\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015043441/http://www.touristcenter.com.ph/philippines/information/angeles.html| archivedate= 15 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"Andro\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~camiling/towns.htm\n| archive-url = https://archive.today/20070618132315/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~camiling/towns.htm\n| url-status    = dead\n| archive-date = 2007-06-18\n| title       = Towns and Barangays of Pampanga\n| accessdate  = 2007-11-24\n| last        = Camiling\n| first       = Alejandro S.\n|author2=Camiling, Teresita Z\n| work        = Andro's Kapampangan Page\n| publisher   = Andro Camiling\n| quote       = ... per the Year 2000 Census\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1899, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] transferred the seat of the [[First Philippine Republic]] to Angeles. It then became the site of celebrations for the first anniversary of Philippine independence, which was proclaimed a year earlier in [[Kawit, Cavite]]. Events included a parade, led by the youngest ever Filipino generals, [[Gregorio del Pilar]] and [[Manuel Tinio]], with General Aguinaldo viewing the proceedings from the Pamintuan Residence, which was the Presidential Palace from May to July 1899 (and later was the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|Central Bank of the Philippines]] office in Central Luzon, before its ownership passed to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]). Aguinaldo's sojourn was short, however, for in July of this same year he transferred his government to the province of [[Tarlac]] following Angeles' occupation by the American forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=341377|title=Punch-drunk to fitness|work=philstar.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\nOn 10 August 1899, U.S. forces began the attack on Angeles confident in capturing it in a few days. However, the Filipino Army defending the town refused to give in so easily and fiercely fought back and for three months, they battled the Americans in and around the town. It was only after the battle on 5 November 1899 that the town finally fell into American hands. The Battle of Angeles was considered to be the longest in the history of the [[Filipino-American War]] in Pampanga. This led to the establishment of an American camp in Barrio Talimundoc (in what is now Lourdes Sur), located next to the railroad station, in order to establish control over the central plains of Luzon. In January 1900, General [[Frederick D. Grant]] organized the first U.S. Civil Government in Angeles by appointing an ''alcalde'' or municipal mayor, beginning American rule over Angeles.<ref>[http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period Angeles City History Pt. 2 (American Period) | Angeles City Bars | Angeles City Hotels | Forums | Photos | Videos<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143500/http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, the [[United States Army]] studied relocating their post from Barrio Talimundoc to a fertile plain in Barrio [[Sapang Bato]], which supposedly had better grass for their horses. A year after that, U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed an executive order on 1 September, establishing {{convert|7700|acre|km2}} of land in Sapang Bato as [[Fort Stotsenburg]] (which later would expand to {{convert|156204|acre|km2}} in 1908 to become [[Clark Air Base]]). It was centered on what would in later years become Clark Air Base's parade ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkab.org/history/index.htm |title=Clark Air Base History |publisher=Clarkab.org |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Americans quickly commandeered Holy Rosary Parish Church and converted it into an army hospital, with the choir loft served as a dental clinic. The ''[[clergy house|convento]]'', which now houses Holy Family Academy, was the barracks for medical officers and enlisted men. The [[sacristy]] was the only portion where Angele\u00f1os could hear [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. When the Americans finally vacated the church in 1904 and relocated to Fort Stotsenburg, [[parish priest]] Rev. Vicente Lapus listed a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]638 for portions of the church destroyed, looted church items and treasures, and arrears on rentals.\n\n===World War II===\nHours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japan attacked the Philippines, targeting the American military presence, as well as the Philippine Army, and taking over the civilian government. During the Japanese occupation in the country, 57,000 Filipino and American [[prisoners of war]] passed the town of Angeles. They were forced to join the [[Bataan Death March]], going to [[Camp O'Donnell]] in [[Capas, Tarlac]]. Angele\u00f1os showed their sympathy by handing them food, milk, boiled eggs, rice cakes, cigarettes, and water. Angele\u00f1os followed them up to the train station in Dau railway station in [[Mabalacat]] to give moral and spiritual support, and even helped the escapees.\n\nWar historians considered the bombing of Fort Stotsenburg on 8 December 1941 at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. as one of the most destructive air raids in [[World War II]], because almost all the American war planes were wrecked on the ground. In thirty minutes, the air might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of America in the Far East was completely destroyed.\n\nOn the early morning of New Year's Day 1942, the first Japanese troops entered Angeles; they would occupy it until January 1945. During the Japanese invasion, another type of local government was set up on 22 January 1942. During the Japanese occupation, Clark Air Base then became a major center for staging Japanese air operations. Japanese aircraft flying out of Clark participated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], considered to be the largest naval battle of the Second World War and possibly the largest naval battle in history.<ref name=\"Morison1956\">{{cite book | chapter = Leyte, June&nbsp;1944 \u2013 January 1945 |title=[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] |volume=XII |last=Morison | first =Samuel E. |authorlink= |year=1956 |publisher=Little & Brown |location=Boston |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Woodward1947\">{{cite book |title=The Battle for Leyte Gulf |last=Woodward |first=C.

After three years of atrocities committed by Japanese forces, the town and the rest of the Philippines were finally liberated by the combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops in 1945. The building of the general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was situated in Angeles from January 1945 to June 1946, during and after World War II.\n\n===Independence and cityhood===\nAfter World War II, the Philippines gained independence from the United States on 4 July 1946, but then would be tied to a neo-colonial relationship. The \"Treaty of General Relations\" signed on independence day itself signified the Americans' withdrawal and surrender of possession, control and sovereignty over the Philippines, except the use of their bases. It was followed by the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement on 14 March 1947, allowing the U.S. to maintain territorial integrity and sovereignty over Clark Air Base and [[Subic Bay|Subic Naval Base]] for the next 44 years. Clark occupied 63,103 hectares and served as the tactical operational U.S. air force installation in the entire Southeast Asian region that had the capacity to accommodate the U.S. military transport planes, which served the entire Western Pacific.\n\nThrough the years, although Fort Stotsenburg continued to expand to become what is now known as Clark Air Base, Angeles, despite its proximity to the American camp, did not progress fast and remained fairly small until the end of World War II. It was finally inaugurated on 1 January 1964 as a chartered city under Republic Act No. 3700 and then it entered a period of tremendous growth that has resulted in its present position as the \"Premier City in Central Luzon.\" It was then Mayor Rafael del Rosario's brainchild that Angeles became a city. He gained the distinction of being the last municipal mayor of Angeles. He was assisted in the preparation of the City Chapter by Attorney Enrique Tayag, a prominent resident of the town. Congresswoman Juanita L. Nepomuceno of the first district of Pampanga sponsored the bill in Congress, which was approved by then President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], the ninth Philippine president and a native of the province of Pampanga.<ref name=\"ClarktonHotel\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.clarkton.com/angeles-city.htm\n |title       = Efren Reyes most Angeles City citizen nowadays\n |accessdate  = 2007-11-24\n |work        = Clarkton Hotel Angeles City Philippines\n |publisher   = Clarkton Hotels Inc.

This is in addition to the voting by the Philippine Senate in 1991 to no longer extend the [[Laurel\u2013Langley Agreement]], which allowed the presence of U.S. military forces on Philippine territory, thus ending the long chapter of Filipino-American relations in the history of Angeles.

From 1953 to 1991, the mean daily low was 73.6&nbsp;\u00b0F and the mean daily high was 88.1&nbsp;\u00b0F, with June being warmest and January and February being the coolest.  The average annual rainfall is 78.39&nbsp;inches.  Typhoons tend to approach from the east during the summer and fall.

Stotsenburg]], a captain of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Cavalry]], was the location of the permanent quarters of the American forces in [[Sapangbato|Sapang Bato, Angeles]]. It is also known as the \"Parade Ground,\" which served as a venue for many important celebrations by the Americans before the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement ended in 1991.\n\n;Salakot Arch: Salakot Arch is a landmark of Angeles.  From 1902 to 1979, Clark Air Base remained a U.S. territory, guaranteed by the Military Bases Agreement in 1947. In 1978, the Philippines, under the dispensation of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and the U.S. finally agreed to establish Philippine sovereignty over the U.S. bases and thus the Clark Air Base Command (CABCOM) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines came into being, following the signing of a revised Military Bases Agreement on 7 January 1979. To commemorate this unprecedented and bold event, the government constructed a special structure based upon the design of a ''salakot'' or native hat, which soon became a widely recognized symbol of this renewed Filipino spirit.\n\n[[File:FvfAngelesCityPampanga0985 44.JPG|thumb|The Pamintuan Mansion used to house the Central Bank of the Philippines in Region III.]]\n;Old Pamintuan Residence:Old Pamintuan Residence served as the seat of government of the First Philippine Republic under General Emilio Aguinaldo from May to July 1899 and the central headquarters for Major General [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], the father of General Douglas MacArthur.  It used to serve as municipal hall of Angeles and later the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] in Central Luzon. The National Historical Commission and the city government with the help of the embassy of France in the Philippines funded the restoration of the mansion into the present-day Museum of Philippine Social History.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.interaksyon.com/article/93949/france-funds-conversion-of-pamintuan-mansion-in-pampanga-into-museum-of-philippine-social-history|title = France funds conversion of Pamintuan Mansion in Pampanga into Museum of Philippine Social History|date = 25 August 2014|accessdate = 26 August 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120038/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/93949/france-funds-conversion-of-pamintuan-mansion-in-pampanga-into-museum-of-philippine-social-history|archive-date = 26 August 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n;Founders' Residence (''Bale Matua''): Located at the heart of Santo Rosario, it is the oldest building in the city.  It was built in 1824 by the city founder, Don \u00c1ngel Pantale\u00f3n de Miranda, and his wife, Do\u00f1a Rosalia de Jesus, and was inherited by their only daughter, Do\u00f1a Juana de Miranda de Henson.  This house, which is made of high stone and an ornate gate, nostalgically symbolizes the glorious past of Angeles amidst the overwhelming onslaughts of modernization.\n\n;Camalig: Camalig was built in 1840 by Don Ciriaco de Miranda, the first ''gobernadorcillo'' of Angeles, and was used as a grain storehouse along Santo Rosario Street.  It was restored in 1980 by Armando L. Nepomuceno and is now the site of Armando's Pizza and the historic Camalig Restaurant.\n\n;Post Office Building (''Deposito''): It is a building that was constructed in 1899 for the purpose of depositing religious statues and carriages of the Catholic Church, hence the name ''Deposito.''  It was also used as the headquarters of the 11th Film Exchange U.S. Army from 1946 to 1947 and was then used as a jailhouse for recalcitrant U.S. troops during the Philippine\u2013American War.  On 6 February 1967, the Angeles Post Office moved to this building.  It is now the site of Angeles Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Center.\n\n[[File:Santo Rosario 1.JPG|thumb|The Santo Rosario Church]]\n;Holy Rosary Parish Church (Santo Rosario Church): [[Holy Rosary Parish, Angeles|Holy Rosary Parish]] Church (Santo Rosario Church) was constructed from 1877 to 1896 by the \"Polo y Servicio\" labor system, a kind of forced labor imposed on Filipino peasants by the Spanish colonial government.  It was used as a military hospital by the U.S. Army from August 1899 to December 1900. Its backyard was the execution ground to the Spanish forces in shooting down Filipino rebels and suspects.\n\n;Holy Family Academy Building: Holy Family Academy Building was once a convent and was served as a military hospital of the U.S. Army in 1900.  It was later used as troop barracks, officers' quarters and arsenal by the Japanese Imperial Military Forces in the year of 1942.\n\n[[File:Bale Herencia.jpg|thumb|The Bale Herencia (Ancestral House) as of 2009]]\n;Bale Herencia (Ancestral House): Built in 1860, it is situated in Lakandula Street corner Santo Rosario Street.  It is a picturesque house with the unsavory reputation of having been built for the mistress of a parish priest. The current owners have leased the place to various restaurants, food stalls, and other businesses like salons and computer shops. The antique architecture, however, is still preserved.\n\n;Juan D. Nepomuceno Center for Kapampangan Studies: Houses a library, museum of archives and gallery, research center and theater, put up by the Holy Angel University in 2002 to preserve, study and promote Kapampangan history and culture. In 2012, the Museum of Kapampangan Arts was also opened in the university, housing some of National Artist Vicente Manansala's works and drafts.\n\n;Lily Hill: Lily Hill was a strategic observation post for monitoring Japanese movement in World War II. Remains of Japanese aircraft were found here at the end of the war. Along this hill can now be found Lily Hill Duty Free Store.\n\n;Bayanihan Park: Bayanihan Park (formerly Astro Park) is an ideal spot for sports and recreational activities having basketball and volleyball courts and huge space for jogging and other recreational activities.  This is where the famous and historical \"Salakot Arch\" is now located. It is being managed by SM City Clark.\n\n[[File:MuseumofAngelesjf3942 08.JPG|thumbnail|The Museum of Angeles]]\n;''Museo ning Angeles'' (Museum of Angeles): ''Museo ning Angeles'' (Museum of Angeles) is a vintage building located at the prime \"Santo Rosario Historic District\" across the Holy Rosary Church.  This edifice was constructed in 1922 and served as the ''Municipio del Pueblo'' or Town Hall until 1998. The Museum has become the venue of the city's cultural activities be it from the or government sector. From the time it opened in the year 1999, it has been a beehive of activity from exhibits, art classes, concerts, venue for performances and climax for traditional celebrations. In June 2012, the National Museum of the Philippines declared the Museo ning Angeles as an \"Important Cultural Property of the Philippines,\" the first cultural property to be given such a distinction. The museum is currently administered by Kuliat Foundation, Inc.\n:*Inside the museum is '''Balikdan''' (meaning \"to look back\") which is about understanding Angeles's past for the present. The sections begin with the establishment of Culiat in 1796 and finish with Mt. Pinatubo's fury in 1991.\n:*Also within the infrastructure is the '''Culinarium'''. Pampanga, most specifically Angeles, is known as the \"Culinary Capital of the Philippines.\" This is dedicated to the Kapampangan culinary arts and science that has emanated from the basic concept that the preparation of food is a heritage and a legacy worth preserving.\n:*'''Dioramic Scenes of Traditional Life in Pampanga''', which is depicted in ten tableaus, are scenes of traditional town and country life in Pampanga. These dioramas were created by fashion designer Beatriz 'Patis' Pamintuan Tesoro using her Nenita dolls dressed in the most intricately embroidered Filipiniana outfits, with amazing detailing not only on the clothes, but also in the accessories and background.\n[[File:Angeles Museum During Xmas Season.jpg|thumbnail|The Museum of Angeles and the Angeles City Public Library during the Christmas season]]\n;Reynaldo G. Alejandro Culinary Library: The Reynaldo G. Alejandro Culinary Library is dedicated to the memory of Mr. Reynaldo \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Gamboa Alejandro (1941\u20132009), who was a leading exponent of Filipino arts and culture. Some years before his untimely demise, Ronnie donated a part of his extensive library to the Culiat Foundation in support of its efforts to promote and preserve the Kapampangan culinary heritage.\n\n===Sex tourism===\nA consequence of the presence of U.S. bases in the country is the prostitution industry in the city.

The new settlers cleared the woodland and cultivated the area for rice and sugar farming. Don \u00c1ngel built his first house with light materials at the northwest corner of the intersection of Sapang Balen and the road going towards the town of [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]]. It was later donated to the [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic Church]] and became a cemetery called \"Campo Santong Matua\" (today the site of Nepomuceno Coliseum).<ref>[http://philippinestravelguide.net/visit/angeles/ Angeles City | Philippines Travel Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724005348/http://philippinestravelguide.net/visit/angeles/ |date=24 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 12 May 1812, the new settlers tried to make Culiat a self-governing town but the friars resisted the move, led by Fray Jos\u00e9 Pometa. Ten years later, on 11 February 1822, Don \u00c1ngel filed a petition for the township of Culiat to secede from San Fernando, but it was denied. This was followed by another petition within the same year, jointly signed by Don \u00c1ngel, his son-in-law, Mariano Henson, and the latter's father, Severino Henson. He donated 35 hectares for the construction of the first Catholic church, a convent and a primary school while Do\u00f1a Agustina Henson de Nepomuceno, the niece of who would become the first ''{{lang|es|gobernadorcillo}}'' of Angeles in 1830, Don Ciriaco de Miranda, gave land for the new public market. Don \u00c1ngel paid the complete amount required by law just for the secession of Culiat from San Fernando. There were only 160 taxpayers then but the law required that it should have at least 500 taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|title=General Tourist info Angeles City \u2013 Philippines|accessdate=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717020450/http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|archive-date=17 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLocated some {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Pampanga's capital, Culiat became a barrio of San Fernando for 33 years and on 8 December 1829, became a separate municipality. The newly-autonomous town was renamed \"{{lang|es|El Pueblo de los \u00c1ngeles}}\" in honor of its patron saints, the Holy Angels, and the name of its founder, Don \u00c1ngel, coinciding with the rise of new ''[[barangay|barrio]]s'' such as Santo Cristo (as the ''[[poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'' or town proper), Cutcut, Pampang and Pulong Anunas. The progressive barrios developed some new industries like a sugar mill and a wine distillery. The transition of Angeles from a jungle clearing to a barrio, to a town and finally to a city took 168 years and in all that time, it survived locusts' infestations, wars, epidemics, volcanic eruptions and typhoons to become one of the fast rising towns in the country.  When it received its first official municipal charter, the town contained some 661 people, 151 houses and an area of 38.65&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"TouristCenter\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.touristcenter.com.ph/philippines/information/angeles.html\n| title       = Tourist information and services on Angeles City Philippines\n| accessdate  = 2007-11-24\n| work        = Tourist Center\n| publisher   = Tourist Center Corporation Philippines\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015043441/http://www.touristcenter.com.ph/philippines/information/angeles.html| archivedate= 15 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"Andro\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~camiling/towns.htm\n| archive-url = https://archive.today/20070618132315/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~camiling/towns.htm\n| url-status    = dead\n| archive-date = 2007-06-18\n| title       = Towns and Barangays of Pampanga\n| accessdate  = 2007-11-24\n| last        = Camiling\n| first       = Alejandro S.\n|author2=Camiling, Teresita Z\n| work        = Andro's Kapampangan Page\n| publisher   = Andro Camiling\n| quote       = ... per the Year 2000 Census\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1899, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] transferred the seat of the [[First Philippine Republic]] to Angeles. It then became the site of celebrations for the first anniversary of Philippine independence, which was proclaimed a year earlier in [[Kawit, Cavite]]. Events included a parade, led by the youngest ever Filipino generals, [[Gregorio del Pilar]] and [[Manuel Tinio]], with General Aguinaldo viewing the proceedings from the Pamintuan Residence, which was the Presidential Palace from May to July 1899 (and later was the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|Central Bank of the Philippines]] office in Central Luzon, before its ownership passed to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]). Aguinaldo's sojourn was short, however, for in July of this same year he transferred his government to the province of [[Tarlac]] following Angeles' occupation by the American forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=341377|title=Punch-drunk to fitness|work=philstar.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\nOn 10 August 1899, U.S. forces began the attack on Angeles confident in capturing it in a few days. However, the Filipino Army defending the town refused to give in so easily and fiercely fought back and for three months, they battled the Americans in and around the town. It was only after the battle on 5 November 1899 that the town finally fell into American hands. The Battle of Angeles was considered to be the longest in the history of the [[Filipino-American War]] in Pampanga. This led to the establishment of an American camp in Barrio Talimundoc (in what is now Lourdes Sur), located next to the railroad station, in order to establish control over the central plains of Luzon. In January 1900, General [[Frederick D. Grant]] organized the first U.S. Civil Government in Angeles by appointing an ''alcalde'' or municipal mayor, beginning American rule over Angeles.<ref>[http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period Angeles City History Pt. 2 (American Period) | Angeles City Bars | Angeles City Hotels | Forums | Photos | Videos<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143500/http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, the [[United States Army]] studied relocating their post from Barrio Talimundoc to a fertile plain in Barrio [[Sapang Bato]], which supposedly had better grass for their horses. A year after that, U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed an executive order on 1 September, establishing {{convert|7700|acre|km2}} of land in Sapang Bato as [[Fort Stotsenburg]] (which later would expand to {{convert|156204|acre|km2}} in 1908 to become [[Clark Air Base]]). It was centered on what would in later years become Clark Air Base's parade ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkab.org/history/index.htm |title=Clark Air Base History |publisher=Clarkab.org |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Americans quickly commandeered Holy Rosary Parish Church and converted it into an army hospital, with the choir loft served as a dental clinic. The ''[[clergy house|convento]]'', which now houses Holy Family Academy, was the barracks for medical officers and enlisted men. The [[sacristy]] was the only portion where Angele\u00f1os could hear [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. When the Americans finally vacated the church in 1904 and relocated to Fort Stotsenburg, [[parish priest]] Rev. Vicente Lapus listed a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]638 for portions of the church destroyed, looted church items and treasures, and arrears on rentals.\n\n===World War II===\nHours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japan attacked the Philippines, targeting the American military presence, as well as the Philippine Army, and taking over the civilian government. During the Japanese occupation in the country, 57,000 Filipino and American [[prisoners of war]] passed the town of Angeles. They were forced to join the [[Bataan Death March]], going to [[Camp O'Donnell]] in [[Capas, Tarlac]]. Angele\u00f1os showed their sympathy by handing them food, milk, boiled eggs, rice cakes, cigarettes, and water. Angele\u00f1os followed them up to the train station in Dau railway station in [[Mabalacat]] to give moral and spiritual support, and even helped the escapees.\n\nWar historians considered the bombing of Fort Stotsenburg on 8 December 1941 at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. as one of the most destructive air raids in [[World War II]], because almost all the American war planes were wrecked on the ground. In thirty minutes, the air might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of America in the Far East was completely destroyed.\n\nOn the early morning of New Year's Day 1942, the first Japanese troops entered Angeles; they would occupy it until January 1945. During the Japanese invasion, another type of local government was set up on 22 January 1942. During the Japanese occupation, Clark Air Base then became a major center for staging Japanese air operations. Japanese aircraft flying out of Clark participated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], considered to be the largest naval battle of the Second World War and possibly the largest naval battle in history.<ref name=\"Morison1956\">{{cite book | chapter = Leyte, June&nbsp;1944 \u2013 January 1945 |title=[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] |volume=XII |last=Morison | first =Samuel E. |authorlink= |year=1956 |publisher=Little & Brown |location=Boston |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Woodward1947\">{{cite book |title=The Battle for Leyte Gulf |last=Woodward |first=C.

After three years of atrocities committed by Japanese forces, the town and the rest of the Philippines were finally liberated by the combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops in 1945. The building of the general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was situated in Angeles from January 1945 to June 1946, during and after World War II.\n\n===Independence and cityhood===\nAfter World War II, the Philippines gained independence from the United States on 4 July 1946, but then would be tied to a neo-colonial relationship. The \"Treaty of General Relations\" signed on independence day itself signified the Americans' withdrawal and surrender of possession, control and sovereignty over the Philippines, except the use of their bases. It was followed by the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement on 14 March 1947, allowing the U.S. to maintain territorial integrity and sovereignty over Clark Air Base and [[Subic Bay|Subic Naval Base]] for the next 44 years. Clark occupied 63,103 hectares and served as the tactical operational U.S. air force installation in the entire Southeast Asian region that had the capacity to accommodate the U.S. military transport planes, which served the entire Western Pacific.\n\nThrough the years, although Fort Stotsenburg continued to expand to become what is now known as Clark Air Base, Angeles, despite its proximity to the American camp, did not progress fast and remained fairly small until the end of World War II. It was finally inaugurated on 1 January 1964 as a chartered city under Republic Act No. 3700 and then it entered a period of tremendous growth that has resulted in its present position as the \"Premier City in Central Luzon.\" It was then Mayor Rafael del Rosario's brainchild that Angeles became a city.

It is also known as the \"Parade Ground,\" which served as a venue for many important celebrations by the Americans before the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement ended in 1991.\n\n;Salakot Arch: Salakot Arch is a landmark of Angeles.  From 1902 to 1979, Clark Air Base remained a U.S. territory, guaranteed by the Military Bases Agreement in 1947. In 1978, the Philippines, under the dispensation of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and the U.S. finally agreed to establish Philippine sovereignty over the U.S. bases and thus the Clark Air Base Command (CABCOM) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines came into being, following the signing of a revised Military Bases Agreement on 7 January 1979. To commemorate this unprecedented and bold event, the government constructed a special structure based upon the design of a ''salakot'' or native hat, which soon became a widely recognized symbol of this renewed Filipino spirit.\n\n[[File:FvfAngelesCityPampanga0985 44.JPG|thumb|The Pamintuan Mansion used to house the Central Bank of the Philippines in Region III.]]\n;Old Pamintuan Residence:Old Pamintuan Residence served as the seat of government of the First Philippine Republic under General Emilio Aguinaldo from May to July 1899 and the central headquarters for Major General [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], the father of General Douglas MacArthur.

It was built in 1824 by the city founder, Don \u00c1ngel Pantale\u00f3n de Miranda, and his wife, Do\u00f1a Rosalia de Jesus, and was inherited by their only daughter, Do\u00f1a Juana de Miranda de Henson.  This house, which is made of high stone and an ornate gate, nostalgically symbolizes the glorious past of Angeles amidst the overwhelming onslaughts of modernization.\n\n;Camalig: Camalig was built in 1840 by Don Ciriaco de Miranda, the first ''gobernadorcillo'' of Angeles, and was used as a grain storehouse along Santo Rosario Street.

Nepomuceno and is now the site of Armando's Pizza and the historic Camalig Restaurant.\n\n;Post Office Building (''Deposito''): It is a building that was constructed in 1899 for the purpose of depositing religious statues and carriages of the Catholic Church, hence the name ''Deposito.''  It was also used as the headquarters of the 11th Film Exchange U.S. Army from 1946 to 1947 and was then used as a jailhouse for recalcitrant U.S. troops during the Philippine\u2013American War.  On 6 February 1967, the Angeles Post Office moved to this building.  It is now the site of Angeles Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Center.\n\n[[File:Santo Rosario 1.JPG|thumb|The Santo Rosario Church]]\n;Holy Rosary Parish Church (Santo Rosario Church): [[Holy Rosary Parish, Angeles|Holy Rosary Parish]] Church (Santo Rosario Church) was constructed from 1877 to 1896 by the \"Polo y Servicio\" labor system, a kind of forced labor imposed on Filipino peasants by the Spanish colonial government.  It was used as a military hospital by the U.S. Army from August 1899 to December 1900. Its backyard was the execution ground to the Spanish forces in shooting down Filipino rebels and suspects.\n\n;Holy Family Academy Building: Holy Family Academy Building was once a convent and was served as a military hospital of the U.S. Army in 1900.

Remains of Japanese aircraft were found here at the end of the war. Along this hill can now be found Lily Hill Duty Free Store.\n\n;Bayanihan Park: Bayanihan Park (formerly Astro Park) is an ideal spot for sports and recreational activities having basketball and volleyball courts and huge space for jogging and other recreational activities.

It is being managed by SM City Clark.\n\n[[File:MuseumofAngelesjf3942 08.JPG|thumbnail|The Museum of Angeles]]\n;''Museo ning Angeles'' (Museum of Angeles): ''Museo ning Angeles'' (Museum of Angeles) is a vintage building located at the prime \"Santo Rosario Historic District\" across the Holy Rosary Church.  This edifice was constructed in 1922 and served as the ''Municipio del Pueblo'' or Town Hall until 1998. The Museum has become the venue of the city's cultural activities be it from the or government sector. From the time it opened in the year 1999, it has been a beehive of activity from exhibits, art classes, concerts, venue for performances and climax for traditional celebrations. In June 2012, the National Museum of the Philippines declared the Museo ning Angeles as an \"Important Cultural Property of the Philippines,\" the first cultural property to be given such a distinction. The museum is currently administered by Kuliat Foundation, Inc.\n:*Inside the museum is '''Balikdan''' (meaning \"to look back\") which is about understanding Angeles's past for the present. The sections begin with the establishment of Culiat in 1796 and finish with Mt. Pinatubo's fury in 1991.\n:*Also within the infrastructure is the '''Culinarium'''. Pampanga, most specifically Angeles, is known as the \"Culinary Capital of the Philippines.\" This is dedicated to the Kapampangan culinary arts and science that has emanated from the basic concept that the preparation of food is a heritage and a legacy worth preserving.\n:*'''Dioramic Scenes of Traditional Life in Pampanga''', which is depicted in ten tableaus, are scenes of traditional town and country life in Pampanga. These dioramas were created by fashion designer Beatriz 'Patis' Pamintuan Tesoro using her Nenita dolls dressed in the most intricately embroidered Filipiniana outfits, with amazing detailing not only on the clothes, but also in the accessories and background.\n[[File:Angeles Museum During Xmas Season.jpg|thumbnail|The Museum of Angeles and the Angeles City Public Library during the Christmas season]]\n;Reynaldo G.
