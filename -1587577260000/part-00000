He was the second son of the wind instrument maker Ernst Moritz Glier (1834\u20131896) from [[Saxony]] ([[Klingenthal]]), who emigrated to the [[Russian Empire]] and married J\u00f3zefa (Josephine) Korczak (1849\u20131935), the daughter of his master, from [[Warsaw]]. His original name, as given in his baptism certificate, was '''Reinhold Ernest Glier'''.<ref name=\"K. Gulinskaja 1986\">S. K. Gulinskaja: ''Reinhold Morizevich Glier'' Moscow \"Musika\", 1986, (russian)</ref> About 1900 he changed the spelling and pronunciation of his surname to Gli\u00e8re, which gave rise to the legend, stated by [[Leonid Sabaneyev]] for the first time (1927), of his French or [[Belgium|Belgian]] descent.<ref>Stanley D. Krebs: ''Soviet Composers and the Development of Soviet Music'', London, 1970</ref>\n\nHe entered the Kiev school of music in 1891, where he was taught violin by [[Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk]], among others. In 1894 Gli\u00e8re entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]] where he studied with [[Sergei Taneyev]] (counterpoint), [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]] (composition), [[Jan H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd]] (violin; he dedicated his Octet for Strings, Op. 5, to H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd), [[Anton Arensky]] and [[Georgi Conus]] (both [[harmony]]). He graduated in 1900, having composed a one-act [[opera]] ''Earth and Heaven'' (after [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]) and received a gold medal in composition.<ref name=\"K. Gulinskaja 1986\"/> In the following year Gli\u00e8re accepted a teaching post at the Moscow [[Gnessin State Musical College|Gnesin School of Music]]. Taneyev found two private pupils for him in 1902: [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] and the eleven-year-old [[Sergei Prokofiev]], whom Gli\u00e8re taught on Prokofiev's parental estate Sontsovka.<ref>Natalia Savkina: ''\"Prokofiev: His life and times\"'', Paganiniana Publications Inc., New Jersey, USA, 1984, {{ISBN|0-86622-021-6}}).</ref> Gli\u00e8re studied conducting with [[Oskar Fried]] in Berlin from 1905 to 1908. One of his co-students was [[Sergei Koussevitzky|Serge Koussevitzky]], who conducted the premiere of Gli\u00e8re's ''Symphony No. 2'', Op. 25, on 23 January 1908 in Berlin. Back in Moscow, Gli\u00e8re returned again to the Gnesin School. In the following years Gli\u00e8re composed the [[symphonic poem]] ''Sireny'', Op. 33 (1908), the programme symphony ''Ilya Muromets'', Op. 42 (1911) and the [[ballet]]-pantomime ''Chrizis'', Op. 65 (1912). In 1913 he gained an appointment to the school of music in Kiev, which was raised to the status of conservatory shortly after, as [[Kiev Conservatory]]. A year later he was appointed director. In Kiev he taught among others [[Levko Revutsky|Levko (Lev) Revoutski]], [[Borys Lyatoshynsky]] and Vladimir Dukelsky (who became well known in the West as [[Vernon Duke]]).\n\nIn 1920 Gli\u00e8re moved to the Moscow Conservatory where he (intermittently) taught until 1941. [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov|Boris Alexandrov]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[Alexander Davidenko]], [[Lev Knipper]] and [[Alexander Mosolov]] were some of his pupils from the Moscow era. For some years he held positions in the organization Proletkul't and worked with the [[People's Commissariat for Education]]. The theatre was in the centre of his work now. In 1923 Gli\u00e8re was invited by the [[Azerbaijan]] People's Commissariat of Education to come to [[Baku]] and compose the prototype of an Azerbaijani national opera. The result of his ethnographical research was the opera ''Shakh-Senem'', now considered the cornerstone of the Soviet-Azerbaijan national opera tradition. Here the musical legacy of the Russian classics from [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]] to [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] is combined with [[Folk music|folk song]] material and some symphonic orientalisms. In 1927, inspired by the ballerina [[Yekaterina Vasilyevna Geltzer]] (1876\u20131962), he wrote the music for the ballet ''Krasny mak'' (''[[The Red Poppy]]''), later revised, to avoid the connotation of [[opium]], as ''Krasny tsvetok'' (''The Red Flower'', 1955). ''The Red Poppy'' was praised \"as the first Soviet ballet on a revolutionary subject\". Perhaps this is his most famous work in Russia as well as abroad. One number from the score, his arrangement of a Russian folk ''[[chastushka]]'' song ''[[Yablochko]]'' (\"little apple\") consists of an introduction, a basso statement of the theme, and a series of increasingly frenetic variations ending with a powerful orchestral climax.  It is identified in the ballet score by its almost equally well-known name, the ''Russian Sailor's Dance''.  It is probably his best-known single piece, and is still heard at symphony concerts around the world, frequently as an encore.   The ballet-pantomime ''Chrizis'' was revised just after ''The Red Poppy'', in the late 1920s, followed by the popular ballet ''Comedians'' after [[Lope de Vega]] (1931, later re-written and renamed ''The Daughter from Castile'').\n\nAfter 1917 Gli\u00e8re never visited Western Europe, as many other Russian composers did. He gave concerts in [[Siberia]] and other remote areas of Russia instead. He was working in [[Uzbekistan]] as a \"musical development helper\" at the end of the 1930s. From this time emerged the \"drama with music\" ''Gyulsara'' and the opera ''Leyli va Medzhnun'', both composed with the Uzbek [[Talib Sadykov]] (1907\u20131957). From 1938 to 1948 Gli\u00e8re was Chairman of the Organization Committee of the [[Union of Soviet Composers|Soviet Composers Association]]. Before the revolution Gli\u00e8re had already been honoured three times with the [[State Prizes of the Soviet Republics|Glinka prize]]. During his last few years he was very often awarded: Azerbaijan (1934), the Russian Soviet Republic (1936), Uzbekistan (1937) and the USSR (1938) appointed him [[People's Artist of the USSR|Artist of the People]]. The title \"Doctor of Art Sciences\" was awarded to him in 1941. He won first degree [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prizes]]: in 1946 (''Concerto for Voice and Orchestra''), 1948 (''Fourth String Quartet''), and 1950 (''The Bronze Horseman'').\n\nAs Taneyev's pupil and an 'associated' member of the circle around the Petersburg publisher [[Mitrofan Belyayev]], it appeared Gli\u00e8re was destined to be a chamber musician. In 1902 Arensky wrote about the Sextet, Op. 1, \"one recognizes Taneyev easily as a model and this does praise Gli\u00e8re\". Unlike Taneyev, Gli\u00e8re felt more attracted to the national Russian tradition as he was taught by Rimsky-Korsakov's pupil Ippolitov-Ivanov. [[Alexander Glazunov]] even certified an \"obtrusively Russian style\" to Gli\u00e8re's 1st Symphony. The 3rd Symphony ''Ilya Muromets'' was a synthesis between national Russian tradition and impressionistic refinement. The premiere was in Moscow in 1912, and it resulted in the award of the Glinka Prize. The symphony depicts in four tableaux the adventures and death of the Russian hero [[Ilya Muromets]]. This work was widely performed, in Russia and abroad, and earned him worldwide renown. It became an item in the extensive repertoire of [[Leopold Stokowski]], who made, with Gli\u00e8re's approval, an abridged version, shortened to around the half the length of the original. Today's cult status of Ilya Muromets is based not least on the pure dimensions of the original 80-minute work, but ''Ilya Muromets'' demonstrates the high level of Gli\u00e8re's artistry. The work has a comparatively modern tonal language, massive [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] instrumentation and long lyrical lines.\n\nNotwithstanding his political engagement after the October revolution Gli\u00e8re kept out of the ideological ditch war between the [[Association for Contemporary Music]] (ASM) and the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians]] (RAPM) during the late 1920s. Gli\u00e8re concentrated primarily on composing monumental operas, ballets, and [[cantata]]s. His symphonic idiom, which combined broad [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] epics with cantabile lyricism, is governed by rich, colourful harmony, bright and well-balanced orchestral colours and perfect traditional forms. Obviously this secured his acceptance by Tsarist and Soviet authorities, at the same time creating resentment from many composers who suffered intensely under the Soviet regime. As the last genuine representative of the pre-revolutionary national Russian school, i.e. a 'living classic', Gli\u00e8re was immune to the standard reproach of \"formalism\" (mostly equivalent to \"modernity\" or \"bourgeois decadence\"). Thus the infamous events of 1936 and 1948 passed Gli\u00e8re by.\n\nGliere wrote concerti for [[Harp Concerto (Gli\u00e8re)|harp]] (Op. 74, 1938), coloratura soprano (Op. 82, 1943), cello (Op. 87, 1946, dedicated to [[Sviatoslav Knushevitsky]]), [[Horn Concerto (Gli\u00e8re)|horn]] (Op. 91, 1951, dedicated to [[Valery Polekh]]), and violin (Op. 100, 1956, unfinished, completed by [[Boris Lyatoshinsky]]). Nearly unexplored are Gli\u00e8re's educational compositions, his chamber works, piano pieces and songs from his time at the Moscow Gnesin School of Music.\n\nHe died in [[Moscow]] on 23 June 1956.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Three Glinka Awards (not [[Glinka State Prize of the RSFSR|Glinka Prizes]])\n:1905 \u2013 for the first sextet (nominated by Glazunov, Liadov, Balakirev)\n:1912 \u2013 for his symphonic poem \"Siren\"\n:1914 \u2013 for Third Symphony (\"Ilya of Murom\")\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] \u2013 a musical drama \"Gyulsary\"\n* 1938 \u2013 [[Order of the Badge of Honour]]\n* Three [[Orders of Lenin]]\n:1945 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 70th anniversary of\"\n:1950 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 75th anniversary of\"\n:1955 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 80th anniversary of\"\n* Three [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]s, first class\n:1946 \u2013 a concerto for coloratura soprano and orchestra\n:1948 \u2013 for the Fourth String Quartet.\n:1950 \u2013 for the ballet \"The Bronze Horseman\" (1949)\n* Twice [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR]] (1925 and 1927)\n* [[People's Artist of the Azerbaijani SSR]] (1934) \u2013 for \"special services to workers and the development of the new Turkic musical culture,\" for his years of work on the creation of the opera \"Shahsanam\")\n* [[People's Artist of RSFSR]] (1935)\n* [[People's Artist of the Uzbek SSR]] (1937) \u2013 for creation of the musical drama \"Gyulsary\".\n* [[People's Artist of USSR]] (1938)\n\n==List of works==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n<ref>Boris S.

He was the second son of the wind instrument maker Ernst Moritz Glier (1834\u20131896) from [[Saxony]] ([[Klingenthal]]), who emigrated to the [[Russian Empire]] and married J\u00f3zefa (Josephine) Korczak (1849\u20131935), the daughter of his master, from [[Warsaw]]. His original name, as given in his baptism certificate, was '''Reinhold Ernest Glier'''.<ref name=\"K. Gulinskaja 1986\">S. K. Gulinskaja: ''Reinhold Morizevich Glier'' Moscow \"Musika\", 1986, (russian)</ref> About 1900 he changed the spelling and pronunciation of his surname to Gli\u00e8re, which gave rise to the legend, stated by [[Leonid Sabaneyev]] for the first time (1927), of his French or [[Belgium|Belgian]] descent.<ref>Stanley D. Krebs: ''Soviet Composers and the Development of Soviet Music'', London, 1970</ref>\n\nHe entered the Kiev school of music in 1891, where he was taught violin by [[Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk]], among others. In 1894 Gli\u00e8re entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]] where he studied with [[Sergei Taneyev]] (counterpoint), [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]] (composition), [[Jan H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd]] (violin; he dedicated his Octet for Strings, Op. 5, to H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd), [[Anton Arensky]] and [[Georgi Conus]] (both [[harmony]]). He graduated in 1900, having composed a one-act [[opera]] ''Earth and Heaven'' (after [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]) and received a gold medal in composition.<ref name=\"K. Gulinskaja 1986\"/> In the following year Gli\u00e8re accepted a teaching post at the Moscow [[Gnessin State Musical College|Gnesin School of Music]]. Taneyev found two private pupils for him in 1902: [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] and the eleven-year-old [[Sergei Prokofiev]], whom Gli\u00e8re taught on Prokofiev's parental estate Sontsovka.<ref>Natalia Savkina: ''\"Prokofiev: His life and times\"'', Paganiniana Publications Inc., New Jersey, USA, 1984, {{ISBN|0-86622-021-6}}).</ref> Gli\u00e8re studied conducting with [[Oskar Fried]] in Berlin from 1905 to 1908. One of his co-students was [[Sergei Koussevitzky|Serge Koussevitzky]], who conducted the premiere of Gli\u00e8re's ''Symphony No. 2'', Op. 25, on 23 January 1908 in Berlin. Back in Moscow, Gli\u00e8re returned again to the Gnesin School. In the following years Gli\u00e8re composed the [[symphonic poem]] ''Sireny'', Op. 33 (1908), the programme symphony ''Ilya Muromets'', Op. 42 (1911) and the [[ballet]]-pantomime ''Chrizis'', Op. 65 (1912). In 1913 he gained an appointment to the school of music in Kiev, which was raised to the status of conservatory shortly after, as [[Kiev Conservatory]]. A year later he was appointed director. In Kiev he taught among others [[Levko Revutsky|Levko (Lev) Revoutski]], [[Borys Lyatoshynsky]] and Vladimir Dukelsky (who became well known in the West as [[Vernon Duke]]).\n\nIn 1920 Gli\u00e8re moved to the Moscow Conservatory where he (intermittently) taught until 1941. [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov|Boris Alexandrov]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[Alexander Davidenko]], [[Lev Knipper]] and [[Alexander Mosolov]] were some of his pupils from the Moscow era. For some years he held positions in the organization Proletkul't and worked with the [[People's Commissariat for Education]]. The theatre was in the centre of his work now. In 1923 Gli\u00e8re was invited by the [[Azerbaijan]] People's Commissariat of Education to come to [[Baku]] and compose the prototype of an Azerbaijani national opera. The result of his ethnographical research was the opera ''Shakh-Senem'', now considered the cornerstone of the Soviet-Azerbaijan national opera tradition. Here the musical legacy of the Russian classics from [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]] to [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] is combined with [[Folk music|folk song]] material and some symphonic orientalisms. In 1927, inspired by the ballerina [[Yekaterina Vasilyevna Geltzer]] (1876\u20131962), he wrote the music for the ballet ''Krasny mak'' (''[[The Red Poppy]]''), later revised, to avoid the connotation of [[opium]], as ''Krasny tsvetok'' (''The Red Flower'', 1955). ''The Red Poppy'' was praised \"as the first Soviet ballet on a revolutionary subject\". Perhaps this is his most famous work in Russia as well as abroad. One number from the score, his arrangement of a Russian folk ''[[chastushka]]'' song ''[[Yablochko]]'' (\"little apple\") consists of an introduction, a basso statement of the theme, and a series of increasingly frenetic variations ending with a powerful orchestral climax.  It is identified in the ballet score by its almost equally well-known name, the ''Russian Sailor's Dance''.  It is probably his best-known single piece, and is still heard at symphony concerts around the world, frequently as an encore.   The ballet-pantomime ''Chrizis'' was revised just after ''The Red Poppy'', in the late 1920s, followed by the popular ballet ''Comedians'' after [[Lope de Vega]] (1931, later re-written and renamed ''The Daughter from Castile'').\n\nAfter 1917 Gli\u00e8re never visited Western Europe, as many other Russian composers did. He gave concerts in [[Siberia]] and other remote areas of Russia instead. He was working in [[Uzbekistan]] as a \"musical development helper\" at the end of the 1930s. From this time emerged the \"drama with music\" ''Gyulsara'' and the opera ''Leyli va Medzhnun'', both composed with the Uzbek [[Talib Sadykov]] (1907\u20131957). From 1938 to 1948 Gli\u00e8re was Chairman of the Organization Committee of the [[Union of Soviet Composers|Soviet Composers Association]]. Before the revolution Gli\u00e8re had already been honoured three times with the [[State Prizes of the Soviet Republics|Glinka prize]]. During his last few years he was very often awarded: Azerbaijan (1934), the Russian Soviet Republic (1936), Uzbekistan (1937) and the USSR (1938) appointed him [[People's Artist of the USSR|Artist of the People]]. The title \"Doctor of Art Sciences\" was awarded to him in 1941. He won first degree [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prizes]]: in 1946 (''Concerto for Voice and Orchestra''), 1948 (''Fourth String Quartet''), and 1950 (''The Bronze Horseman'').\n\nAs Taneyev's pupil and an 'associated' member of the circle around the Petersburg publisher [[Mitrofan Belyayev]], it appeared Gli\u00e8re was destined to be a chamber musician. In 1902 Arensky wrote about the Sextet, Op. 1, \"one recognizes Taneyev easily as a model and this does praise Gli\u00e8re\". Unlike Taneyev, Gli\u00e8re felt more attracted to the national Russian tradition as he was taught by Rimsky-Korsakov's pupil Ippolitov-Ivanov. [[Alexander Glazunov]] even certified an \"obtrusively Russian style\" to Gli\u00e8re's 1st Symphony. The 3rd Symphony ''Ilya Muromets'' was a synthesis between national Russian tradition and impressionistic refinement. The premiere was in Moscow in 1912, and it resulted in the award of the Glinka Prize. The symphony depicts in four tableaux the adventures and death of the Russian hero [[Ilya Muromets]]. This work was widely performed, in Russia and abroad, and earned him worldwide renown. It became an item in the extensive repertoire of [[Leopold Stokowski]], who made, with Gli\u00e8re's approval, an abridged version, shortened to around the half the length of the original. Today's cult status of Ilya Muromets is based not least on the pure dimensions of the original 80-minute work, but ''Ilya Muromets'' demonstrates the high level of Gli\u00e8re's artistry. The work has a comparatively modern tonal language, massive [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] instrumentation and long lyrical lines.\n\nNotwithstanding his political engagement after the October revolution Gli\u00e8re kept out of the ideological ditch war between the [[Association for Contemporary Music]] (ASM) and the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians]] (RAPM) during the late 1920s. Gli\u00e8re concentrated primarily on composing monumental operas, ballets, and [[cantata]]s. His symphonic idiom, which combined broad [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] epics with cantabile lyricism, is governed by rich, colourful harmony, bright and well-balanced orchestral colours and perfect traditional forms. Obviously this secured his acceptance by Tsarist and Soviet authorities, at the same time creating resentment from many composers who suffered intensely under the Soviet regime. As the last genuine representative of the pre-revolutionary national Russian school, i.e. a 'living classic', Gli\u00e8re was immune to the standard reproach of \"formalism\" (mostly equivalent to \"modernity\" or \"bourgeois decadence\"). Thus the infamous events of 1936 and 1948 passed Gli\u00e8re by.\n\nGliere wrote concerti for [[Harp Concerto (Gli\u00e8re)|harp]] (Op. 74, 1938), coloratura soprano (Op. 82, 1943), cello (Op. 87, 1946, dedicated to [[Sviatoslav Knushevitsky]]), [[Horn Concerto (Gli\u00e8re)|horn]] (Op. 91, 1951, dedicated to [[Valery Polekh]]), and violin (Op. 100, 1956, unfinished, completed by [[Boris Lyatoshinsky]]). Nearly unexplored are Gli\u00e8re's educational compositions, his chamber works, piano pieces and songs from his time at the Moscow Gnesin School of Music.\n\nHe died in [[Moscow]] on 23 June 1956.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Three Glinka Awards (not [[Glinka State Prize of the RSFSR|Glinka Prizes]])\n:1905 \u2013 for the first sextet (nominated by Glazunov, Liadov, Balakirev)\n:1912 \u2013 for his symphonic poem \"Siren\"\n:1914 \u2013 for Third Symphony (\"Ilya of Murom\")\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] \u2013 a musical drama \"Gyulsary\"\n* 1938 \u2013 [[Order of the Badge of Honour]]\n* Three [[Orders of Lenin]]\n:1945 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 70th anniversary of\"\n:1950 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 75th anniversary of\"\n:1955 \u2013 \"for outstanding achievements in the field of music and to honor the 80th anniversary of\"\n* Three [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]s, first class\n:1946 \u2013 a concerto for coloratura soprano and orchestra\n:1948 \u2013 for the Fourth String Quartet.\n:1950 \u2013 for the ballet \"The Bronze Horseman\" (1949)\n* Twice [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR]] (1925 and 1927)\n* [[People's Artist of the Azerbaijani SSR]] (1934) \u2013 for \"special services to workers and the development of the new Turkic musical culture,\" for his years of work on the creation of the opera \"Shahsanam\")\n* [[People's Artist of RSFSR]] (1935)\n* [[People's Artist of the Uzbek SSR]] (1937) \u2013 for creation of the musical drama \"Gyulsary\".\n* [[People's Artist of USSR]] (1938)\n\n==List of works==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n<ref>Boris S.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. [[Monsoon]]), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the [[Red Sea]], where high rates of [[evaporation]], low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the [[Dead Sea]]. Historically, several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the \"Practical Salinity Scale\" where salinity was measured in \"practical salinity units (psu)\".

Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see [[Water cycle|Hydrologic cycle]]). Halley noted that most lakes that don't have ocean outlets (such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], see [[endorheic basin]]), have high salt content. Halley termed this process \"continental weathering\".\n\nHalley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt's other dominant ion, chloride, results from [[outgassing]] of chloride (as [[hydrochloric acid]]) with other gases from Earth's interior via [[volcano]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.\n\nOcean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/[[plate tectonics|tectonic]] system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include [[evaporite]] deposits, pore-water burial, and reactions with seafloor [[basalt]]s.<ref name=Pinet/>{{rp|133}}\n\n==Human impacts==\n[[Climate change]], rising atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing [[ocean acidification|acidity]], reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity.

A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations of 2% (in arguments to the contrary) is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration. This signals the [[kidney]] to excrete sodium, but seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood's sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with [[nerve]] conduction, ultimately producing fatal [[Non-epileptic seizure|seizure]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Survival skills|Survival manual]]s consistently advise against drinking seawater.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch29.pdf |chapter=29 |title=Shipboard Medicine |accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref> A summary of 163 [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]] voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not.

Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. [[Monsoon]]), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the [[Red Sea]], where high rates of [[evaporation]], low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the [[Dead Sea]].

Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see [[Water cycle|Hydrologic cycle]]). Halley noted that most lakes that don't have ocean outlets (such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], see [[endorheic basin]]), have high salt content. Halley termed this process \"continental weathering\".\n\nHalley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt's other dominant ion, chloride, results from [[outgassing]] of chloride (as [[hydrochloric acid]]) with other gases from Earth's interior via [[volcano]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.\n\nOcean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/[[plate tectonics|tectonic]] system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include [[evaporite]] deposits, pore-water burial, and reactions with seafloor [[basalt]]s.<ref name=Pinet/>{{rp|133}}\n\n==Human impacts==\n[[Climate change]], rising atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing [[ocean acidification|acidity]], reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity.

A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations of 2% (in arguments to the contrary) is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration. This signals the [[kidney]] to excrete sodium, but seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability.

Upper Canada included all of modern-day [[Southern Ontario]] and all those areas of [[Northern Ontario]] in the {{lang|fr|[[Pays d'en Haut]]}} which had formed part of [[New France]], essentially the watersheds of the [[Ottawa River]] or Lakes [[Lake Huron|Huron]] and [[Lake Superior|Superior]], excluding any lands within the watershed of [[Hudson Bay]]. The \"upper\" prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the [[Great Lakes]], mostly above the headwaters of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], contrasted with [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) to the northeast.\n\nIt was the primary destination of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist refugees]] and settlers from the United States after the [[American Revolution]], who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada. The province was characterized by its British way of life, including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law, rather than mixed as in [[Lower Canada]] or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]].<ref>http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/index.php</ref> The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/constitutional-act-1791|title=Constitutional Act 1791|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> In [[War of 1812|1812, war broke out]] between Great Britain and the United States, leading to several battles in Upper Canada. The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada, but the war ended with the situation unchanged.\n\nThe government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons, known as the \"[[Family Compact]]\", who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials. In 1837, an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system. Representative government would be established in the 1840s. Upper Canada existed from its establishment on 2 December 1791 to 10 February 1841, when it was united with adjacent Lower Canada to form the [[Province of Canada]].\n\n==Establishment==\n{{see also|Constitutional history of Canada}}\n[[File:Southern Ontario-mapped-2.jpg|thumb|324x324px|Map of Upper Canada's districts]]\nAs part of the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Seven Years' War]] global conflict and the [[French and Indian War]] in North America, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] retained control over the former [[New France]], which had been defeated in the French and Indian War. The British had won control after [[Fort Niagara]] had surrendered in 1759 and [[Montreal]] [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|capitulated]] in 1760, and the British under [[Robert Rogers (British Army officer)|Robert Rogers]] took formal control of the Great Lakes region in 1760.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=2}}</ref> [[Fort Michilimackinac]] was occupied by Roger's forces in 1761.\n\nThe territories of contemporary southern Ontario and southern Quebec were initially maintained as the single Province of Quebec, as it had been under the French. From 1763 to 1791, the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] maintained its French language, cultural behavioural expectations, practices and laws. The British passed the ''[[Quebec Act]]'' in 1774, which expanded the Quebec colony's authority to include part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] to the west (i.e., parts of southern [[Ontario]]), and other western territories south of the [[Great Lakes]] including much of what would become the United States' [[Northwest Territory]], including the modern states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Wisconsin]] and parts of [[Minnesota]].\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] ended in 1783, Britain retained control of the area north of the Ohio River. The official boundaries remained undefined until 1795 and the [[Jay Treaty]]. The British authorities encouraged the movement of people to this area from the United States, offering free land to encourage population growth. For settlers, the head of the family received {{convert|100|acres|ha}} and {{convert|50|acres|ha}} per family member, and soldiers received larger grants.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pp=5-6}}</ref> These settlers are known as [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and were primarily English-speaking Protestants. The first townships (Royal and Cataraqui) along the St. Lawrence and eastern Lake Ontario were laid out in 1784, populated mainly with decommissioned soldiers and their families.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=6}}</ref>\n\n\"Upper Canada\" became a political entity on 26 December 1791 with the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]'s passage of the ''[[Constitutional Act of 1791]]''. The act divided the Province of Quebec into Upper and [[Lower Canada]], but did not yet specify official borders for Upper Canada. The division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. The first lieutenant-governor was [[John Graves Simcoe]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/simcoe_john_graves_5E.html | title=Biography \u2013 SIMCOE, JOHN GRAVES \u2013 Volume V (1801-1820) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haut-Canada | title=Haut-Canada}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe 1795 Jay Treaty officially set the borders between British North America and the United States north to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. On 1 February 1796, the capital of Upper Canada was moved from Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), which was judged to be less vulnerable to attack by the US.\n\nThe Act of Union 1840, passed 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841, merged Upper Canada with Lower Canada to form the short-lived [[United Province of Canada]].\n\n==Government==\n\n===Provincial administration===\nUpper Canada's constitution was said to be \"the very image and transcript\" of the British constitution, and based on the principle of \"[[mixed monarchy]]\" \u2013 a balance of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy.<ref>{{harvp|McNairn|2000|pp=23\u201362}}</ref>\n\nThe Executive arm of government in the colony consisted of a [[Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada|lieutenant-governor]], his [[Executive Council of Upper Canada|executive council]], and the Officers of the Crown (equivalent to the [[Parliament of Canada#Officers|Officers of the Parliament of Canada]]): the [[Adjutant General]] of the Militia, the [[Attorney General of Ontario#List of Attorneys-General of Upper Canada|Attorney General]], the [[Auditor General of Ontario#Auditor General of Land Patents|Auditor General of Land Patents for Upper Canada]], the [[Auditor General]] (only one appointment ever made), [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry|Crown Lands Office]], [[Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (Ontario)|Indian Office]], [[Inspector General]], [[Queen's Printer for Ontario|Kings' Printer]], [[Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Ontario|Provincial Secretary & Registrar's Office]], [[Receiver General for Canada|Receiver General of Upper Canada]], [[Solicitor General of Ontario|Solicitor General]], & [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry|Surveyor General]].<ref>{{harvp|Armstrong|1985|pp=8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Executive Council of Upper Canada]] had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the Legislative Assembly but were usually members of the Legislative Council.<ref>{{harvp|Armstrong|1985|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Parliament===\n[[File:Third Parliament Buildings 1834.jpg|thumb|The third Parliament Building in York was built between 1829 and 1832 at [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]].]]\nThe Legislative branch of the government consisted of the [[Parliament of Upper Canada|parliament]] comprising [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada|legislative council]] and [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|legislative assembly]]. When the capital was first moved to Toronto from Newark (present-day [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) in 1796, the [[Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada]] were located at the corner of Parliament and Front Streets, in buildings that were burned by US forces in the War of 1812, rebuilt, then burned again by accident. The site was eventually abandoned for another, to the west.\n\nThe [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada]] was the upper house governing the province of Upper Canada. Although modelled after the British House of Lords, Upper Canada had no aristocracy. Members of the Legislative council, appointed for life, formed the core of the oligarchic group, the [[Family Compact]], that came to dominate government and economy in the province.\n\nThe [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] functioned as the lower house in the Parliament of Upper Canada. Its legislative power was subject to veto by the appointed Lieutenant Governor, Executive Council, and Legislative Council.\n\n===Local government===\nLocal government in the Province of Upper Canada was based on districts. In 1788, four districts were created:<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=12}}</ref>\n\n*[[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburgh District]], later \"Eastern\"\n*[[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg District]], later \"Midland\"\n*[[Home District|Nassau District]], later \"Home\"\n*[[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse District]], later \"Western\"\n\nThe name changes all took place in 1792.\n\nJustices of the Peace were appointed by the Lt. Governor. Any two justices meeting together could form the lowest level of the justice system, the Courts of Request. A [[Quarter Sessions|Court of Quarter Sessions]] was held four times a year in each district composed of all the resident justices. The Quarter Sessions met to oversee the administration of the district and deal with legal cases. They formed, in effect, the municipal government until an area was incorporated as either a Police Board or a City after 1834.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nAdditional districts were created from the existing districts as the population grew until 1849, when local government mainly based on [[county|counties]] came into effect. At that time, there were 20 districts; legislation to create a new Kent District was never completed. Up until 1841, the district officials were appointed by the lieutenant-governor, although usually with local input.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Family Compact===\n{{main|Family Compact}}\nThe '''Family Compact''' is the epithet applied to an oligarchic group of men who exercised most of the political and judicial power in Upper Canada from the 1810s to the 1840s. It was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy.<ref>{{harvp|Wallace|1915}}</ref> The uniting factors amongst the Compact were its loyalist tradition, hierarchical class structure and adherence to the established Anglican Church. Leaders such as [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Beverley Robinson]] and [[John Strachan]] proclaimed it an ideal government, especially as contrasted with the rowdy democracy in the nearby United States.<ref name=\"Canadian Encyclopedia\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Family Compact|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|first1=David|last1=Mills|first2=Daniel|last2=Panneton|orig-year=7 February 2006|date=20 March 2017|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/family-compact|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> The Family Compact emerged from the [[War of 1812]] and collapsed in the aftermath of the [[Rebellions of 1837]].\n{{Members of the Family Compact}}\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Some Members of the Family Compact\n| lines  = 4\n| width  = 120\n| height = 100\n|File:John Strachan.jpg|alt2=Bishop John Strachan|[[John Strachan|Bishop Strachan]], the acknowledged Anglican leader of the Family Compact\n|File:Sir_John_Beverley_Robinson.jpg|alt1=Sir John Beverley Robinson|[[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], acknowledged leader of the Family Compact, member of the Legislative Assembly and later the Legislative Council<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/robinson_john_beverley_9E.html | title=Biography \u2013 ROBINSON, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY \u2013 Volume IX (1861-1870) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n|File:William Henry Boulton.png|alt7=William Henry Boulton|[[William Henry Boulton]], 8th Mayor of Toronto and member of the Legislative Assembly<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/boulton_william_henry_10E.html | title=Biography \u2013 BOULTON, WILLIAM HENRY \u2013 Volume X (1871-1880) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n|File:ANMacNab.jpg|alt8=ANMacNab|Sir [[Allan Napier MacNab]], 1st Baronet of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada\n|File:Henry Sherwood.png|alt9=Henry Sherwood|[[Henry Sherwood]], 13th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Brockville\n}}\n\n===Reform movement===\n{{main|William Lyon Mackenzie|Reform movement (Upper Canada)}}\n\nThere were many outstanding individual reform politicians in Upper Canada, including [[Robert Randal]], [[Peter Perry]], [[Marshall Spring Bidwell]], William Ketchum and Dr. [[William Warren Baldwin]]; however, '''organised''' collective reform activity began with [[Robert Fleming Gourlay]]. Gourlay was a well-connected Scottish emigrant who arrived in 1817, hoping to encourage \"assisted emigration\" of the poor from Britain. He solicited information on the colony through township questionnaires, and soon became a critic of government mismanagement. When the local legislature ignored his call for an inquiry, he called for a petition to the British Parliament. He organised township meetings, and a provincial convention&nbsp;\u2013 which the government considered dangerous and seditious. Gourlay was tried in December 1818 under the 1804 Sedition Act and jailed for 8 months. He was banished from the province in August 1819. His expulsion made him a martyr in the reform community.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=93\u201399}}</ref>\n\nThe next wave of organised Reform activity emerged in the 1830s through the work of [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], [[James Lesslie (publisher)|James Lesslie]], [[John Rolph (politician)|John Rolph]], [[William John O'Grady]] and Dr [[Thomas David Morrison|Thomas Morrison]], all of Toronto. They were critical to introducing the British Political Unions to Upper Canada. Political Unions were not parties. The unions organised petitions to Parliament.\n\nThe Upper Canada Central Political Union was organised in 1832\u201333 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in 1836) while [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was in England. This union collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie's unjust expulsion from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact.<ref>{{harvp|Wilton|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}</ref>\n[[File:Second market in York (Toronto).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Second market in York (Toronto)]]\nThis union was reorganised as the Canadian Alliance Society (1835). It shared a large meeting space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]]. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the platform (such as secret ballot & universal suffrage) of the [[Owenite]] National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement in England.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pp=181\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society (1836), when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W. Baldwin. After the disastrous 1836 elections, it took the final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was the Toronto Political Union that called for a Constitutional Convention in July 1837, and began organising local \"Vigilance Committees\" to elect delegates. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion of 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=192\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n{{Members of the Reform Movement (Upper Canada)}}\n\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Members of the Reform Movement\n| lines  = 4\n| width  = 120\n| height = 100\n|File:RobertGourlay3862.JPG|[[Robert Fleming Gourlay]]\n|File:WilliamLyonMackenzie.jpeg|[[William Lyon Mackenzie]]\n|File:Thomas David Morrison.png|Dr [[Thomas David Morrison|Thomas D.

Mackenzie in December 1837. Long term grievances included antagonism between Later Loyalists and British Loyalists, political corruption, the collapse of the international financial system and the resultant economic distress, and a growing republican sentiment. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Rebellion]] in [[Lower Canada]] (present day [[Quebec]]) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) \u2013 mainly through the support of the [[Hunters' Lodges]], a secret anti-British, American militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes. They launched the Patriot War in 1838\u201339.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greer|first=Allan|title=1837\u201338: Rebellion Reconsidered|journal=Canadian Historical Review|year=1995|volume=LXVII|issue=1|pages=1\u201330|doi=10.3138/chr-076-01-01 }}</ref>\n\n[[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|John Lambton, Lord Durham]]'s support for \"[[responsible government]]\" undercut the Tories and gradually led the public to reject what it viewed as poor administration, unfair land and education policies, and inadequate attention to urgent transportation needs. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham's report]] led to the administrative unification of Upper and Lower Canada as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Responsible government did not occur until the late 1840s under [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]].<ref>{{harvp|Careless|1967|pp=113\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Sydenham and the Union of the Canadas===\n{{wikisource|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\n{{main|Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Province of Canada}}\n\nAfter the Rebellions, the new governor, [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham]], proved an exemplary [[Utilitarian]], despite his aristocratic pretensions. This combination of free trade and aristocratic pretensions needs to be underscored; although a liberal capitalist, Sydenham was no radical democrat. Sydenham approached the task of implementing those aspects of Durham's report that the colonial office approved of, municipal reform, and the union of the Canadas, with a \"campaign of state violence and coercive institutional innovation&nbsp;... empowered not just by the British state but also by his [[Benthamite]] certainties.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=The Liberal Order Framework: A prospectus for a reconnaissance of Canadian History|journal=Canadian Historical Review|year=2000|volume=81|issue=4|pages=616\u2013678|doi=10.3138/chr.81.4.616 }}</ref> Like governors Bond Head before him, and Metcalfe after, he was to turn to the [[Orange Order]] for often violent support. It was Sydenham who played a critical role in transforming Compact Tories into Conservatives.\n\nSydenham introduced a vast expansion of the state apparatus through the introduction of municipal government. Areas not already governed through civic corporations or police boards would be governed through centrally controlled District Councils with authority over roads, schools, and local policing. A strengthened Executive Council would further usurp much of the elected assembly's legislative role, leaving elected politician's to simply review the administration's legislative program and budgets.\n\n==Settlement==\n\n===First Nations dispossession and reserves===\n{{main|First Nations in Ontario|Anishinaabe|Iroquois}}\n\nThe First Nations occupying the territory that was to become Upper Canada were:\n\n*'''Anishinaabe''' or '''Anishinabe'''\u2014or more properly (plural) '''Anishinaabeg''' or '''Anishinabek'''.

Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the [[Mississaugas]].

First, the cash-strapped Crown government in Canada could pay and reward the services and loyalty of the \"United Empire Loyalists\" who, originated outside of Canada, without encumbrance of debt by being awarded with small portions of land (under {{convert|200|acre|ha|disp=or|sigfig=1}}) with the proviso that it be settled by those to which it was granted; Second, portions would be reserved for the future use of the Crown and the clergy that did not require settlement by which to gain control. Lt. Governor Simcoe saw this as the mechanism by which an aristocracy might be created,<ref>{{harvp|Gates|1968|p=}}</ref> and that compact settlement could be avoided with the grants of large tracts of land to those Loyalists not required to settle on it as the means of gaining control.\n\n====Assisted immigration====\n{{main|Calton weavers|Petworth Emigration Scheme}}\n\nThe '''Calton weavers''' were a community of handweavers established in the community of [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]], then in [[Lanarkshire]] just outside [[Glasgow]], Scotland in the 18th century.<ref>Calton is now within Glasgow itself.</ref> In the early 19th century, many of the weavers emigrated to Canada, settling in [[Carleton Place, Ontario|Carleton Place]] and other communities in eastern [[Ontario]], where they continued their trade.<ref name=campey>{{harvp|Campey|2005|p=52ff}}</ref>\n\nIn 1825, 1,878 [[Irish Immigrants]] from the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] arrived in the community of Scott's Plains. The British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish families to Upper Canada in 1822. The scheme was managed by [[Peter Robinson (1785\u20131838)|Peter Robinson]], a member of the Family Compact and brother of the Attorney General. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour.\n\n====Talbot settlement====\n{{main|Talbot settlement}}\n\n[[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Thomas Talbot]] emigrated in 1791, where he became personal secretary to [[John Graves Simcoe]], Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Talbot convinced the government to allow him to implement a land settlement scheme of {{convert|5000|acre|ha|sigfig=1}} in Elgin County in the townships of Dunwich and Aldborough in 1803.<ref>{{harvp|Humber|1991|p=193}}</ref> According to his government agreement, he was entitled to {{convert|200|acre|ha|sigfig=1}} for every settler who received {{convert|50|acre|ha}}; in this way he gained an estate of {{convert|20000|acre|ha|sigfig=1}}. Talbot's administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers' names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, erasing their entry. Talbot's abuse of power was a contributing factor in the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=142\u2013144}}</ref>\n\n===Crown and clergy reserves===\n{{main|Clergy reserve|Clergy Corporation}}\n\nThe Crown reserves, one seventh of all lands granted, were to provide the provincial executive with an independent source of revenue not under the control of the elected Assembly. The clergy reserves, also one seventh of all lands granted in the province, were created \"for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy\" in lieu of tithes. The revenue from the lease of these lands was claimed by the Rev. [[John Strachan]] on behalf of the [[Church of England]]. These reserves were directly administered by the Crown; which, in turn, came under increasing political pressure from other Protestant bodies. The Reserve lands were to be a focal point of dissent within the Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=171\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe Clergy Corporation was incorporated in 1819 to manage the clergy reserves. After the Rev. [[John Strachan]] was appointed to the Executive Council, the advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor, in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England's autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. Although all clergymen in the Church of England were members of the body corporate, the act prepared in 1819 by Strachan's former student, Attorney General [[John Beverly Robinson]], also appointed the Inspector General and the Surveyor General to the board, and made a quorum of three for meetings; these two public officers also sat on the Legislative Council with Strachan. These three were usually members of the Family Compact.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=George A.|title=The Political and Administrative History of the Upper Canada Clergy Reserves, 1790\u20131855|year=1959|publisher=PhD Thesis, Dept. of History, University of Toronto|location=Toronto|pages=133ff}}</ref>\n\nThe clergy reserves were not the only types of landed endowment for the Anglican Church and clergy.

The Upper Canadian state ended its policy of granting land to \"unofficial\" settlers and implemented a broad plan of revenue-generating sales. The Crown replaced its old policy of land grants to ordinary settlers in newly opened districts with land sales by auction. It also passed legislation that allowed the auctioning of previously granted land for payment of back-taxes.<ref name=Schrauwers2010>{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=The Gentlemanly Order & the Politics of Production in the Transition to Capitalism in the Home District, Upper Canada|journal=Labour/Le Travail|year=Spring 2010|volume=65|issue=1|pages=26\u201331|jstor=20798984}}</ref>\n\n===Canada Company===\n{{main|Canada Company}}\n[[File:Canada Company Office 1834.jpg|thumbnail|left|Canada Company Office, 1834]]\n{{rquote|right|The greater portion of British emigrants, arriving in Canada without funds and the most exalted ideas of the value and productiveness of land, purchase extensively on credit...

The Lieutenant Governor increasingly found himself depending upon the customs duties shared with, but collected in Lower Canada for revenue; after a dispute with the lower province on the relative proportions to be allocated to each, these duties were withheld, forcing the Lieutenant Governor to search for new sources of revenue. The Canada Company was created as a means of generating government revenue that was not under the control of the elected Assembly, thereby granting the Lt. Governor greater independence from local voters.\n\nThe plan for the Canada Company was promoted by the province's Attorney General, [[John Beverly Robinson]], then studying law at Lincoln's Inn in London. The Lt. Governor's financial crisis led to a quick adoption of Robinson's scheme to sell the Crown reserves to a new land company which would provide the provincial government with annual payments of between \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000. The Canada Company was chartered in London in 1826; after three years of mismanagement by [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]], the company hired [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]] and [[Thomas Mercer Jones]] to manage the company's Upper Canadian business. Jones was to manage the \"[[Huron Tract]],\" and Allan to sell the Crown reserves already surveyed in other districts.<ref>{{harvp|Lee|2004|pp=98\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Canada Company, \"the poorest individual can here procure for himself and family a valuable tract; which, with a little labour, he can soon convert into a comfortable home, such as he could probably never attain in any other country&nbsp;\u2013 all his own!\" However, recent studies have suggested that a minimum of \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 plus the cost of land was required to start a new farm in the bush.

However, due to the lack of a detailed breakdown, it is difficult to count each group, and this may be considered abuse of statistics. An idea of the ethnic breakdown can be had if one considers the religious census of 1842, which is helpfully provided below: Roman Catholics were 15% of the population, and adherents to this religion were, at the time, mainly drawn from the Irish and the French settlers. The Roman Catholic faith also numbered some votaries from amongst the Scottish settlers.

Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1668, and [[Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]] in 1701. Southern Ontario was part of the ''Pays d'en-haut'' (Upper Country) of [[New France]], and later part of the province of Quebec until Quebec was split into Upper and [[Lower Canada]] in 1791. The first wave of settlement in the Detroit/Windsor area came in the 18th century during the French regime. A second wave came in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the areas of Eastern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. In the [[Ottawa Valley]], in particular, some families have moved back and forth across the Ottawa River for generations (the river is the border between Ontario and Quebec). In the city of [[Ottawa]] some areas such as Vanier and Orleans have a rich Franco-heritage where families often have members on both sides of the [[Ottawa River]].\n\n====Loyalists/Later Loyalists====\n{{main|United Empire Loyalist|Expulsion of the Loyalists}}\n\nAfter an initial group of about 7,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of \"late-Loyalists\" arrived in the late 1790s and were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown to obtain land if they came from the US. Their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. Following the War of 1812, the colonial government under Lt. Governor Gore took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. The tensions between the Loyalists and late Loyalists erupted in the \"Alien Question\" crisis in 1820\u201321 when the Bidwells (Barnabas and his son Marshall) sought election to the provincial assembly. They faced opponents who claimed they could not hold elective office because of their American citizenship. If the Bidwells were aliens so were the majority of the province. The issue was not resolved until 1828 when the Colonial government retroactively granted them citizenship.\n\n====Freed slaves====\nThe [[Act Against Slavery]] passed in Upper Canada on 9 July 1793. The 1793 \"Act against Slavery\" forbade the importation of any additional slaves and freed children. It did not grant freedom to adult slaves\u2014they were finally freed [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|by the British Parliament in 1833]]. As a consequence, many Canadian slaves fled south to New England and New York, where slavery was no longer legal. Many American slaves who had escaped from the South via the [[Underground Railroad]] or fleeing from the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] in the Ohio Valley came north to Ontario, a good portion settling on land lots and began farming.<ref>Cooper, Afua, \"Acts of Resistance: Black Men and Women Engage Slavery in Upper Canada, 1793\u20131803,\" ''Ontario History,'' Spring 2007, Vol. 99 Issue 1, pp 5\u201317</ref> It is estimated that thousands of escaped slaves entered Upper Canada from the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/underground-railroad|title=Underground Railroad|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====British====\n{{see also|Great Migration of Canada}}\nThe [[Great Migration of Canada|Great Migration from Britain]] from 1815 to 1850 has been numbered at 800,000.

Governor, Sir [[John Graves Simcoe]], sought to make the Church of England the [[Established Church]] of the province. To that end, he created the clergy reserves, the revenues of which were to support the church. The clergy reserves proved to be a long-term political issue, as other denominations, particularly the [[Church of Scotland]] (Presbyterians) sought a proportional share of the revenues. The Church of England was never numerically dominant in the province, as it was in England, especially in the early years when most of the American born Later Loyalists arrived. The growth of the Church of England depended largely on later British emigration for growth.\n\nThe Church was led by the Rev. [[John Strachan]] (1778\u20131867), a pillar of the [[Family Compact]]. Strachan was part of the oligarchic ruling class of the province, and besides leading the Church of England, also sat on the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, helped found the [[Bank of Upper Canada]], [[Upper Canada College]], and the [[University of Toronto]].\n\n====Catholic Church====\n{{main|Roman Catholicism in Canada|Alexander Macdonell (bishop)}}\n\nFather Alexander Macdonell was a Scottish Catholic priest who formed his evicted clan into '''''The Glengarry Fencibles''''' regiment, of which he served as chaplain. He was the first Catholic [[Royal Army Chaplains' Department|chaplain in the British Army]] since the [[Reformation]]. When the regiment was disbanded, Rev. Macdonell appealed to the government to grant its members a tract of land in Canada, and, in 1804, {{convert|160,000|acre|sigfig=1}} were provided in what is now [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]], Canada.\nIn 1815, he began his service as the first Roman Catholic Bishop at St. Raphael's Church in the Highlands of Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Parish of St. Raphael Glengarry Emigration of 1786 Bishop Alexander Macdonell 1762\u20131840 |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_STU/Plaque_Stormont44.html |website=ontarioplaques.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref> In 1819, he was appointed [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Upper Canada, which in 1826 was erected into a suffragan [[Diocese|bishopric]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Archdiocese of Quebec]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/multiculturalism|title=Multiculturalism|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921/ | title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

O'Grady, like Macdonell, had served as an army chaplain (to [[Connell James Baldwin]]'s soldiers in [[Brazil]]). O'Grady followed Baldwin to [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore Township]] in 1828. From January 1829 he was pastor of St. Paul's church in [[York, Upper Canada|York]]. Tensions between the Scottish and Irish came to a head when O'Grady was defrocked, in part for his activities in the Reform movement. He went on to edit a Reform newspaper in Toronto, the ''Canadian Correspondent''.\n\n====Ryerson and the Methodists====\n{{main|Egerton Ryerson|Methodist Episcopal Church}}\n\nThe undisputed leader of the highly fractious Methodists in Upper Canada was Egerton Ryerson, editor of their newspaper, ''[[The Christian Guardian]]''. Ryerson (1803\u20131882) was an itinerant minister&nbsp;\u2013 or circuit rider&nbsp;\u2013 in the Niagara area for the Methodist Episcopal Church&nbsp;\u2013 an American branch of Methodism. As British immigration increased, Methodism in Upper Canada was torn between those with ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the British [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]]. Ryerson used the ''Christian Guardian'' to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest.\n\n====Presbyterians====\n{{main|Presbyterian Church in Canada}}\n\nThe earliest Presbyterian ministers in Upper Canada came from various denominations based in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. The \"Presbytery of the Canadas\" was formed in 1818 primarily by Scottish [[Associate Presbyterian Church|Associate Presbyterian]] missionaries, yet independently of their mother denomination in the hope of including Presbyterian ministers of all stripes in Upper and Lower Canada.  Although successfully including members from Irish Associate, and American Presbyterian and Reformed denominations, the growing group of missionaries belonging to the Church of Scotland remained separate. Instead, in 1831, they formed their own \"Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in Connection with the Established Church of Scotland\". That same year the \"Presbytery of the Canadas\", having grown and been re-organized, became the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\". In its continued pursuit for Presbyterian unity (and a share of government funding from the clergy reserves for established churches) the United Synod sought a union with the Church of Scotland synod which it finally joined in 1840. However, some ministers had left the United Synod prior to this merger (including, notably, Rev. James Harris, Rev. William Jenkins, and Rev. Daniel Eastman). In the 1832 new Secessionist missionaries began to arrive, belonging to \"The United Associate Synod in Scotland\" (after 1847, the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]). Committed to the voluntarist principle of rejecting government funding they decided against joining the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\" and on Christmas Day 1834 formed the \"Missionary Presbytery of the Canadas\". Although this new presbytery was formed at Rev. James Harris's church in Toronto, he and his congregation remained independent from it. However, the voluntarist, Rev. Jenkins and his congregation in Richmond Hill joined the Missionary Presbytery a few years later. Rev. Eastman had left the United Synod in 1833 to form the \"Niagara Presbytery\" of the Presbyterian Church in the USA. After this presbytery dissolved following the Rebellion of 1837, he rejoined the United Synod which then joined the Church of Scotland. Outside of these four Presbyterian denominations, only two others gained a foothold in the province. The small \"Stamford Presbytery\" of the American Secessionist tradition was formed in 1835 in the Niagara region, and the Scottish Reformed Presbyterian or \"Covenanter\" tradition was represented in the province to an even lesser extent. Despite the numerous denominations, by the late 1830s, the Church of Scotland was the main expression of Presbyterianism in Upper Canada.\n\n====Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers, and Children of Peace====\n[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Sharon Temple]], built by the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]]]]\n{{main|Mennonite|Society of Friends (Upper Canada)|The Children of Peace}}\n\nThese groups of later Loyalists were proportionately larger in the early decades of the province's settlement. The Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers and Children of Peace are the traditional Peace churches. The Mennonites and [[Tunkers]] were generally German-speaking and immigrated as Later Loyalists from Pennsylvania. Many of their descendants continue to speak a form of [[German language|German]] called [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]. The Quakers (Society of Friends) immigrated from New York, the New England States and Pennsylvania. The Children of Peace were founded during the War of 1812 after a schism in the Society of Friends in York County.<ref>{{harvp|Reaman|1957|pp=40\u2013124}}</ref> A further schism occurred in 1828, leaving two branches, \"Orthodox\" Quakers and \"Hicksite\" Quakers.\n\n===Poverty===\n{{see also|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}\nIn the decade ending in 1837, the population of Upper Canada doubled, to 397,489, fed in large part by erratic spurts of displaced paupers, the \"surplus population\" of the British Isles. Historian Rainer Baehre estimated that between 1831 and 1835 a bare minimum of one-fifth of all emigrants to the province arrived totally destitute, forwarded by their parishes in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baehre|first=Rainer|title=Pauper Emigration to Upper Canada in the 1830s|journal=Historie Sociale/Social History|year=1981|volume=XIV|issue=28 |pages=340}}</ref> The pauper immigrants arriving in Toronto were the excess agricultural workers and artisans whose growing ranks sent the cost of parish-based poor relief in England spiralling; a financial crisis that generated frenetic public debate and the overhaul of the [[Poor Laws]] in 1834. \"Assisted emigration,\" a second solution to the problem touted by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Colonial Office, Robert Wilmot Horton, would remove them permanently from the parish poor rolls.\n\nThe roots of Wilmot-Horton's \"assisted emigration\" policies began in April 1820, in the middle of an [[Radical War|insurrection in Glasgow]], where a young, already twice bankrupted [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was setting sail for Canada on a ship called Psyche. After the week-long violence, the rebellion was easily crushed; the participants were driven less by treason than distress. In a city of 147,000 people without a regular parish system of poor relief, between ten and fifteen thousand were destitute. The Prime Minister agreed to provide free transportation from Quebec to Upper Canada, a {{convert|100|acre|adj=on}} land grant, and a year's supply of provisions to any of the rebellious weavers who could pay their own way to Quebec. In all, in 1820 and 1821, a private charity helped 2,716 Lanarkshire and Glasgow emigrants to Upper Canada to take up their free grants, primarily in the [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] area.<ref>{{harvp|Johnston|1972|pp=51\u201354}}</ref> A second project was the [[Petworth Emigration Scheme|Petworth Emigration Committee]] organised by the Reverend Thomas Sockett, who chartered ships and sent emigrants from England to Canada in each of the six years between 1832 and 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Cameron|Maude|2000|p=}}</ref> This area in the south of England was terrorised by the [[Captain Swing|Captain Swing Riots]], a series of clandestine attacks on large farmers who refused relief to unemployed agricultural workers. The area hardest hit&nbsp;\u2013 Kent&nbsp;\u2013 was the area where [[Sir Francis Bond Head]], later Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836, was the [[Poor Law Commissioner|Assistant Poor Law Commissioner]]. One of his jobs was to force the unemployed into \"Houses of Industry.\"\n\n==Trade, monetary policy, and financial institutions==\n\n===Corporations===\n{{main|Corporations (Upper Canada)}}\nThere were two types of corporate actors at work in the Upper Canadian economy: the legislatively [[chartered companies]] and the unregulated [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]]. The joint stock company was popular in building public works, since it should be for general public benefit, as the benefit would otherwise be sacrificed to legislated monopolies with exclusive privileges. or lie dormant. An example of the legislated monopoly is found in the [[Bank of Upper Canada]]. However, the benefit of the joint-stock shareholders, as the risk takers, was whole and entire; and the general public benefitted only indirectly. As late as 1849, even the moderate reform politician [[Robert Baldwin]] was to complain that \"unless a stop were made to it, there would be nothing but corporations from one end of the country to the other.\" Radical reformers, like [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], who opposed all \"legislated monopolies,\" saw joint stock associations as the only protection against \"the whole property of the country... being tied up as an irredeemable appendage to incorporated institutions, and put beyond the reach of individual possession.\"<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|page=21}}</ref> As a result, most of the joint-stock companies formed in this period were created by [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|political reformers]] who objected to the legislated monopolies granted to members of the [[Family Compact]].\n\n===Currency and banking===\n\n====Currency====\n{{see also|Coinage of Upper Canada}}\n\nThe government of Upper Canada never issued a provincial currency. A variety of coins, mainly of French, Spanish, English and American origin circulated. The government used the Halifax standard, where one pound Halifax equalled four Spanish dollars. One [[pound sterling]] equalled \u00a31 2s 2\u00bed (until 1820), and \u00a31 2s 6\u00bdd Halifax pounds after 1820.\n\nPaper currency was issued primarily by the Bank of Upper Canada, although with the diversification of the banking system, each bank would issue its own distinctive notes.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1993|pp=245247}}</ref>\n\n====Bank of Upper Canada====\n{{main|Bank of Upper Canada}}\n[[File:Bank of Upper Canada.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Bank of Upper Canada, Toronto]]\nThe Bank of Upper Canada was \"captured\" from Kingston merchants by the York elite at the instigation of [[John Strachan]] in 1821, with the assistance of [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]], a Toronto merchant and Executive Councillor. York was too small to warrant such an institution as indicated by the inability of its promoters to raise even the minimal 10% of the \u00a3200,000 authorised capital required for start-up. It succeeded where the Bank of Kingston had failed only because it had the political influence to have this minimum reduced by half, and because the provincial government subscribed for two thousand of its eight thousand shares. The administration appointed four of the bank's fifteen directors that, as with the [[Clergy Corporation]], made for a tight bond between the nominally private company and the state. Forty-four men served as bank directors during the 1830s; eleven of them were executive councillors, fifteen of them were legislative councillors, and thirteen were magistrates in Toronto. More importantly, all 11 men who had ever sat on the Executive Council also sat on the board of the Bank at one time or another. 10 of these men also sat on the Legislative Council. The overlapping membership on the boards of the Bank of Upper Canada and on the Executive and Legislative Councils served to integrate the economic and political activities of church, state, and the \"financial sector.\" These overlapping memberships reinforced the oligarchic nature of power in the colony and allowed the administration to operate without any effective elective check. The Bank of Upper Canada was a political sore point for the [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reformers]] throughout the 1830s.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2010|pages=22\u201326}}</ref>\n\n====Bank wars: the Scottish joint-stock banks====\n{{main|Bank of the People}}\nThe difference between the chartered banks and the joint-stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint-stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The formation of new joint-stock banks blossomed in 1835 in the aftermath of a parliamentary report by Dr [[Charles Duncombe (Upper Canada Rebellion)|Charles Duncombe]], which established their legality here. Duncombe's report drew in large part on an increasingly dominant banking orthodoxy in the United Kingdom which challenged the English system of chartered banks. Duncombe's Select Committee on Currency offered a template for the creation of joint-stock banks based on several successful British banks. Within weeks two Devonshire businessmen, Capt. George Truscott and John Cleveland Green, established the \"Farmer's Bank\" in Toronto. The only other successful bank established under this law was \"[[Bank of the People|The Bank of the People]]\" which was set up by Toronto's Reformers. The Bank of the People provided the loan that allowed [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] to establish the newspaper The Constitution in 1836 in the lead up to the Rebellion of 1837. Mackenzie wrote at the time: \"Archdeacon Strachan's bank (the old one)&nbsp;... serve the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer's acres under the harrow of the storekeeper.

It was during this period that the three largest pre-war merchants who imported directly from Britain retired from business as a result; Quetton St. George in 1815, [[Alexander Wood (merchant)|Alexander Wood]] in 1821, and [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]] in 1822. Toronto and Kingston then underwent a boom in the number of increasingly specialised shops and wholesalers.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|page=107}}</ref> The Toronto wholesale firm of [[Isaac Buchanan]] and Company were one of the largest of the new wholesalers. Isaac Buchanan was a Scots merchant in Toronto, in partnership with his brother Peter, who remained in Glasgow to manage the British end of the firm. They established their business in Toronto in 1835, having bought out Isaac's previous partners, William Guild and Co., who had established themselves in Toronto in 1832. As a wholesale firm, the Buchanan's had invested more than \u00a310,000 in their business.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1979|p=28}}</ref>\n\nAnother of those new wholesale businesses was the [[Farmers' Storehouse Company]]. The Farmers Storehouse Company was formed in the Home District and is probably Canada's first [[Farmers' cooperatives|Farmers' Cooperative]]. The Storehouse expedited the sale of farmer's wheat to Montreal, and provided them with cheaper consumer goods.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=102\u2013106}}</ref>\n\n====Wheat and grains====\n{{main|Agriculture in Upper Canada|Corn Laws}}\nUpper Canada was in the unenviable position of having few exports with which to pay for all its imported manufactured needs. For the vast majority of those who settled in rural areas, debt could be paid off only through the sale of wheat and flour; yet, throughout much of the 1820s, the price of wheat went through periodic cycles of boom and bust depending upon the British markets that ultimately provided the credit upon which the farmer lived.\nIn the decade 1830\u201339, exports of wheat averaged less than \u00a31 per person a year (less than \u00a36 per household), and in the 1820s just half that.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1993|p=75}}</ref>\n\nGiven the small amounts of saleable wheat and flour, and the rarity of cash, some have questioned how market oriented these early farmers were. Instead of depending on the market to meet their needs, many of these farmers depended on networks of shared resources and cooperative marketing. For example, rather than hire labour, they met their labour needs through \"work bees.\" such farmers are said to be 'subsistence oriented' and not to respond to market cues; rather, they engage in a [[moral economy]] seeking 'subsistence insurance' and a '[[just price]]'. [[The Children of Peace]] in the village of Hope (now [[Sharon, Ontario|Sharon]]) are a well documented example. They were the most prosperous agricultural community in [[Canada West]] by 1851.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=41\u201350}}</ref>\n\n====Timber====\n{{main|Ottawa River timber trade}}\n\nThe Ottawa River timber trade resulted from Napoleon's 1806 [[Continental Blockade]] in Europe. The United Kingdom required a new source of timber for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the UK's application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The trade in squared timber lasted until the 1850s. The transportation of raw timber by means of [[Timber rafting|floating]] down the Ottawa River was proved possible in 1806 by [[Philemon Wright]].<ref>{{harvp|Woods|1980|p=89}}</ref> Squared timber would be assembled into [[timber rafting|large rafts]] which held living quarters for men on their six-week journey to [[Quebec City]], which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe timber trade was Upper and [[Lower Canada]]'s major industry in terms of employment and value of the product.<ref>{{harvp|Greening|1961|pp=111}}</ref> The largest supplier of square red and white pine to the British market was the [[Ottawa River]]<ref>{{harvp|Greening|1961|p=111}}</ref> and the [[Ottawa Valley]].

The present-day canal is marked in pale grey]]\n\n===Canal system===\n[[File:Engraving of Rideau Canal locks.jpg|thumb|The [[Rideau Canal]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with [[Parliament Hill]] and the old \"Union Station\" visible in the background]]\n{{main|First Welland Canal|Rideau Canal|Desjardins Canal}}\n\nThe early nineteenth century was the age of canals. The [[Erie Canal]], stretching from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York, threatened to divert all of the grain and other trade on the upper Great Lakes through the [[Hudson River]] to New York city after its completion in 1825. Upper Canadians sought to build a similar system that would tie this trade to the [[St Lawrence River]] and [[Montreal]].\n\n====Rideau Canal====\n\nThe Rideau Canal's purpose was military and hence was paid for by the British and not the local treasury. It was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston. The objective was to bypass the [[St. Lawrence River]] bordering New York; a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to an attack. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the [[Ottawa River]] to [[Bytown]] (now [[Ottawa]]), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. Because the Rideau Canal was easier to navigate than the St. Lawrence River due to the series of rapids between Montreal and Kingston, it became a busy commercial artery from Montreal to the Great Lakes. The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John By]] of the [[Royal Engineers]]. The work started in 1826, and was completed 6 years later in 1832 at a cost of \u00a3822,000.\n\n====Welland Canal====\n\nThe Welland Canal was created to directly link Lake Erie with Lake Ontario, bypassing Niagara Falls and the Erie Canal. It was the idea of [[William Hamilton Merritt]] who owned a sawmill, grist mill and store on the [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. The Legislature authorised the joint-stock Welland Canal Company on 19 January 1824, with a capitalisation of $150,000, and Merritt as the agent. The canal was officially opened exactly five years later on 30 November 1829. However, the original route to Lake Erie followed the Welland and Niagara Rivers and was difficult and slow to navigate. The Welland Canal Company obtained a loan of 50,000 pounds from the Province of Upper Canada in March 1831 to cut a canal directly to Gravelly Bay (now [[Port Colborne, Ontario|Port Colborne]]) as the new Lake Erie terminus for the canal.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=153\u2013160}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the canal was finished in 1837, it had cost the province \u00a3425,000 in loans and stock subscriptions. The Company was supposed to have been a private one using private capital; but the province had little private capital available, hence most of the original funds came from New York. To keep the canal in Upper Canadian hands, the province had passed a law barring Americans from the company's directorate. The company was thus controlled by the Family Compact, even though they had few shares. By 1834, it was clear the canal would never make money and that the province would be on the hook for the large loans; the canal and the canal company thus became a political issue, as local farmers argued the huge expense would ultimately only benefit American farmers in the west and the merchants who transported their grain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aitken|first=Hugh G.T.|title=Yates and McIntyre: Lottery Managers|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1953|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36\u201357|doi=10.1017/S0022050700070030}}</ref>\n\n====Desjardins Canal====\nThe '''Desjardins Canal''', named after its promoter Pierre Desjardins, was built to give [[Dundas, Ontario]], easier access to [[Burlington Bay]] and [[Lake Ontario]]. Access to Lake Ontario from Dundas was made difficult by the topography of the area, which included a natural sand and gravel barrier, across Burlington Bay which allowed only boats with a shallow draft through. In 1823 a canal was dug through the sandbar. In 1826 the passage was completed, allowing schooners to sail to neighbouring [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. Hamilton then became a major port and quickly expanded as a centre of trade and commerce. In 1826 a group of Dundas businessmen incorporated to compete with Hamilton and increase the value of their real estate holdings. The project to build Desjardins Canal continued for ten years, from 1827 to 1837, and required constant infusions of money from the province. In 1837, the year it opened, the company's income was \u00a36,000, of which \u00a35,000 was from a government loan and \u00a3166 was received from canal tolls.\n\n===Lake traffic: steamships===\n\n{{main|Great Lakes passenger steamers}}\nThere is disagreement as to whether the Canadian-built {{ship|PS|Frontenac||2}} ({{convert|170|ft|m|disp=comma}}), launched on 7 September 1816, at Ernestown, Ontario or the US-built ''Ontario'' ({{convert|110|ft|m|disp=comma}}), launched in the spring of 1817 at Sacketts Harbor, New York, was the first steamboat on the Great Lakes.

The road was further extended eastward with new capital of [[York, Upper Canada|York]] in 1795. his road was eventually known as [[Ontario Highway 5|Dundas Road]].\n\nA second route was known as '''Lakeshore Road or York Road''' which was built from York to [[Trent River (Ontario)|Trent River]] from 1799 to 1900 and later extended eastwards to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in 1817. This road was later renamed as [[Ontario Highway 2|Kingston Road]].\n\n==United States relations==\n\n===War of 1812 (1812\u20131815)===\n[[File:Push on, brave York volunteers.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the death of [[Isaac Brock]]]]\nDuring the [[War of 1812]] with the United States, Upper Canada was the chief target of the Americans, since it was weakly defended and populated largely by American immigrants. However, division in the United States over the war, a lackluster American militia, the incompetence of American military commanders, and swift and decisive action by the British commander, Sir [[Isaac Brock]], kept Upper Canada part of British North America.\n\nDetroit was captured by the British on 6 August 1812. The [[Michigan Territory]] was held under British control until it was abandoned in 1813. The Americans won the decisive [[Battle of Lake Erie]] (10 September 1813) and forced the British to retreat from the western areas. On the retreat they were intercepted at the [[Battle of the Thames]] (5 October 1813) and destroyed in a major American victory that killed [[Tecumseh]] and broke the power of Britain's Indian allies.<ref>Young, Bennett Henderson, ''The Battle of the Thames: In Which Kentuckians Defeated the British, French and Indians, 5 October 1813.'' Louisville, Ky.: Morton, 1903.</ref>\n\nMajor battles fought on territory in Upper Canada included:\n\n*[[Battle of Queenston Heights]], 13 October 1812\n*Burning and [[Battle of York]], 27 April 1813\n*[[Battle of Fort George]], 27 May 1813\n*[[Battle of Stoney Creek]], 5 June 1813\n*[[Battle of Beaver Dams]], 24 June 1813\n*[[Battle of Lake Erie]], 10 September 1813\n*[[Battle of the Thames]], 5 October 1813\n*[[Battle of Crysler's Farm]], 11 November 1813\n*Burning of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Newark]], 10 December 1813\n*[[Battle of Chippawa]], 5 July 1814\n*[[Battle of Lundy's Lane]], 25 July 1814\n\nMany other battles were fought in American territory bordering Upper Canada, including the [[Northwest Territory]] (most in modern-day Michigan), [[upstate New York]] and naval battles in the Great Lakes.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Ghent]] (ratified in 1815) ended the war and restored the [[status quo ante bellum]].\n\n===1837 Rebellion and Patriot War===\n{{Main|Rebellions of 1837\u20131838|Upper Canada Rebellion|Patriot War}}\n\nMackenzie, Duncombe, [[John Rolph (politician)|John Rolph]] and 200 supporters fled to [[Navy Island]] in the [[Niagara River]], where they declared themselves the [[Republic of Canada]] on 13 December. They obtained supplies from supporters in the United States, resulting in British reprisals (see [[Caroline affair]]). This incident has been used to establish the principle of \"anticipatory self-defense\" in international politics, which holds that it may be justified only in cases in which the \"necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation\". This formulation is part of the [[Caroline test|''Caroline'' test]]. The ''Caroline'' affair is also now invoked frequently in the course of the dispute around [[preemptive strike]] (or [[Preemptive war|preemption]] doctrine).\n\nOn 13 January 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States where he was arrested and charged under the [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Act]].<ref>{{cite DCB |title=McKenzie, William Lyon |first1=Frederick H. |last1=Armstrong |first2=Ronald J. |last2=Stagg |volume=9 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackenzie_william_lyon_9E.html}}</ref> The Neutrality Act of 1794 made it illegal for an American to wage war against any country at peace with the United States.

In 1837, an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system. Representative government would be established in the 1840s.

The British had won control after [[Fort Niagara]] had surrendered in 1759 and [[Montreal]] [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|capitulated]] in 1760, and the British under [[Robert Rogers (British Army officer)|Robert Rogers]] took formal control of the Great Lakes region in 1760.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=2}}</ref> [[Fort Michilimackinac]] was occupied by Roger's forces in 1761.\n\nThe territories of contemporary southern Ontario and southern Quebec were initially maintained as the single Province of Quebec, as it had been under the French. From 1763 to 1791, the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] maintained its French language, cultural behavioural expectations, practices and laws. The British passed the ''[[Quebec Act]]'' in 1774, which expanded the Quebec colony's authority to include part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] to the west (i.e., parts of southern [[Ontario]]), and other western territories south of the [[Great Lakes]] including much of what would become the United States' [[Northwest Territory]], including the modern states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Wisconsin]] and parts of [[Minnesota]].\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] ended in 1783, Britain retained control of the area north of the Ohio River. The official boundaries remained undefined until 1795 and the [[Jay Treaty]]. The British authorities encouraged the movement of people to this area from the United States, offering free land to encourage population growth. For settlers, the head of the family received {{convert|100|acres|ha}} and {{convert|50|acres|ha}} per family member, and soldiers received larger grants.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pp=5-6}}</ref> These settlers are known as [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and were primarily English-speaking Protestants. The first townships (Royal and Cataraqui) along the St. Lawrence and eastern Lake Ontario were laid out in 1784, populated mainly with decommissioned soldiers and their families.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=6}}</ref>\n\n\"Upper Canada\" became a political entity on 26 December 1791 with the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]'s passage of the ''[[Constitutional Act of 1791]]''. The act divided the Province of Quebec into Upper and [[Lower Canada]], but did not yet specify official borders for Upper Canada. The division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. The first lieutenant-governor was [[John Graves Simcoe]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/simcoe_john_graves_5E.html | title=Biography \u2013 SIMCOE, JOHN GRAVES \u2013 Volume V (1801-1820) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haut-Canada | title=Haut-Canada}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe 1795 Jay Treaty officially set the borders between British North America and the United States north to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. On 1 February 1796, the capital of Upper Canada was moved from Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), which was judged to be less vulnerable to attack by the US.\n\nThe Act of Union 1840, passed 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841, merged Upper Canada with Lower Canada to form the short-lived [[United Province of Canada]].\n\n==Government==\n\n===Provincial administration===\nUpper Canada's constitution was said to be \"the very image and transcript\" of the British constitution, and based on the principle of \"[[mixed monarchy]]\" \u2013 a balance of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy.<ref>{{harvp|McNairn|2000|pp=23\u201362}}</ref>\n\nThe Executive arm of government in the colony consisted of a [[Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada|lieutenant-governor]], his [[Executive Council of Upper Canada|executive council]], and the Officers of the Crown (equivalent to the [[Parliament of Canada#Officers|Officers of the Parliament of Canada]]): the [[Adjutant General]] of the Militia, the [[Attorney General of Ontario#List of Attorneys-General of Upper Canada|Attorney General]], the [[Auditor General of Ontario#Auditor General of Land Patents|Auditor General of Land Patents for Upper Canada]], the [[Auditor General]] (only one appointment ever made), [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry|Crown Lands Office]], [[Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (Ontario)|Indian Office]], [[Inspector General]], [[Queen's Printer for Ontario|Kings' Printer]], [[Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Ontario|Provincial Secretary & Registrar's Office]], [[Receiver General for Canada|Receiver General of Upper Canada]], [[Solicitor General of Ontario|Solicitor General]], & [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry|Surveyor General]].<ref>{{harvp|Armstrong|1985|pp=8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Executive Council of Upper Canada]] had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the Legislative Assembly but were usually members of the Legislative Council.<ref>{{harvp|Armstrong|1985|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Parliament===\n[[File:Third Parliament Buildings 1834.jpg|thumb|The third Parliament Building in York was built between 1829 and 1832 at [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]].]]\nThe Legislative branch of the government consisted of the [[Parliament of Upper Canada|parliament]] comprising [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada|legislative council]] and [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|legislative assembly]]. When the capital was first moved to Toronto from Newark (present-day [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) in 1796, the [[Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada]] were located at the corner of Parliament and Front Streets, in buildings that were burned by US forces in the War of 1812, rebuilt, then burned again by accident. The site was eventually abandoned for another, to the west.\n\nThe [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada]] was the upper house governing the province of Upper Canada. Although modelled after the British House of Lords, Upper Canada had no aristocracy. Members of the Legislative council, appointed for life, formed the core of the oligarchic group, the [[Family Compact]], that came to dominate government and economy in the province.\n\nThe [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] functioned as the lower house in the Parliament of Upper Canada. Its legislative power was subject to veto by the appointed Lieutenant Governor, Executive Council, and Legislative Council.\n\n===Local government===\nLocal government in the Province of Upper Canada was based on districts. In 1788, four districts were created:<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|p=12}}</ref>\n\n*[[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburgh District]], later \"Eastern\"\n*[[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg District]], later \"Midland\"\n*[[Home District|Nassau District]], later \"Home\"\n*[[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse District]], later \"Western\"\n\nThe name changes all took place in 1792.\n\nJustices of the Peace were appointed by the Lt. Governor. Any two justices meeting together could form the lowest level of the justice system, the Courts of Request. A [[Quarter Sessions|Court of Quarter Sessions]] was held four times a year in each district composed of all the resident justices. The Quarter Sessions met to oversee the administration of the district and deal with legal cases. They formed, in effect, the municipal government until an area was incorporated as either a Police Board or a City after 1834.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nAdditional districts were created from the existing districts as the population grew until 1849, when local government mainly based on [[county|counties]] came into effect. At that time, there were 20 districts; legislation to create a new Kent District was never completed. Up until 1841, the district officials were appointed by the lieutenant-governor, although usually with local input.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Family Compact===\n{{main|Family Compact}}\nThe '''Family Compact''' is the epithet applied to an oligarchic group of men who exercised most of the political and judicial power in Upper Canada from the 1810s to the 1840s. It was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy.<ref>{{harvp|Wallace|1915}}</ref> The uniting factors amongst the Compact were its loyalist tradition, hierarchical class structure and adherence to the established Anglican Church. Leaders such as [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Beverley Robinson]] and [[John Strachan]] proclaimed it an ideal government, especially as contrasted with the rowdy democracy in the nearby United States.<ref name=\"Canadian Encyclopedia\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Family Compact|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|first1=David|last1=Mills|first2=Daniel|last2=Panneton|orig-year=7 February 2006|date=20 March 2017|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/family-compact|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> The Family Compact emerged from the [[War of 1812]] and collapsed in the aftermath of the [[Rebellions of 1837]].\n{{Members of the Family Compact}}\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Some Members of the Family Compact\n| lines  = 4\n| width  = 120\n| height = 100\n|File:John Strachan.jpg|alt2=Bishop John Strachan|[[John Strachan|Bishop Strachan]], the acknowledged Anglican leader of the Family Compact\n|File:Sir_John_Beverley_Robinson.jpg|alt1=Sir John Beverley Robinson|[[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], acknowledged leader of the Family Compact, member of the Legislative Assembly and later the Legislative Council<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/robinson_john_beverley_9E.html | title=Biography \u2013 ROBINSON, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY \u2013 Volume IX (1861-1870) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n|File:William Henry Boulton.png|alt7=William Henry Boulton|[[William Henry Boulton]], 8th Mayor of Toronto and member of the Legislative Assembly<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/boulton_william_henry_10E.html | title=Biography \u2013 BOULTON, WILLIAM HENRY \u2013 Volume X (1871-1880) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n|File:ANMacNab.jpg|alt8=ANMacNab|Sir [[Allan Napier MacNab]], 1st Baronet of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada\n|File:Henry Sherwood.png|alt9=Henry Sherwood|[[Henry Sherwood]], 13th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Brockville\n}}\n\n===Reform movement===\n{{main|William Lyon Mackenzie|Reform movement (Upper Canada)}}\n\nThere were many outstanding individual reform politicians in Upper Canada, including [[Robert Randal]], [[Peter Perry]], [[Marshall Spring Bidwell]], William Ketchum and Dr. [[William Warren Baldwin]]; however, '''organised''' collective reform activity began with [[Robert Fleming Gourlay]]. Gourlay was a well-connected Scottish emigrant who arrived in 1817, hoping to encourage \"assisted emigration\" of the poor from Britain. He solicited information on the colony through township questionnaires, and soon became a critic of government mismanagement. When the local legislature ignored his call for an inquiry, he called for a petition to the British Parliament. He organised township meetings, and a provincial convention&nbsp;\u2013 which the government considered dangerous and seditious. Gourlay was tried in December 1818 under the 1804 Sedition Act and jailed for 8 months. He was banished from the province in August 1819. His expulsion made him a martyr in the reform community.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=93\u201399}}</ref>\n\nThe next wave of organised Reform activity emerged in the 1830s through the work of [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], [[James Lesslie (publisher)|James Lesslie]], [[John Rolph (politician)|John Rolph]], [[William John O'Grady]] and Dr [[Thomas David Morrison|Thomas Morrison]], all of Toronto. They were critical to introducing the British Political Unions to Upper Canada. Political Unions were not parties. The unions organised petitions to Parliament.\n\nThe Upper Canada Central Political Union was organised in 1832\u201333 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in 1836) while [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was in England. This union collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie's unjust expulsion from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact.<ref>{{harvp|Wilton|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}</ref>\n[[File:Second market in York (Toronto).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Second market in York (Toronto)]]\nThis union was reorganised as the Canadian Alliance Society (1835). It shared a large meeting space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]]. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the platform (such as secret ballot & universal suffrage) of the [[Owenite]] National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement in England.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pp=181\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society (1836), when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W. Baldwin. After the disastrous 1836 elections, it took the final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was the Toronto Political Union that called for a Constitutional Convention in July 1837, and began organising local \"Vigilance Committees\" to elect delegates. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion of 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=192\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n{{Members of the Reform Movement (Upper Canada)}}\n\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Members of the Reform Movement\n| lines  = 4\n| width  = 120\n| height = 100\n|File:RobertGourlay3862.JPG|[[Robert Fleming Gourlay]]\n|File:WilliamLyonMackenzie.jpeg|[[William Lyon Mackenzie]]\n|File:Thomas David Morrison.png|Dr [[Thomas David Morrison|Thomas D.

Mackenzie in December 1837. Long term grievances included antagonism between Later Loyalists and British Loyalists, political corruption, the collapse of the international financial system and the resultant economic distress, and a growing republican sentiment. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Rebellion]] in [[Lower Canada]] (present day [[Quebec]]) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) \u2013 mainly through the support of the [[Hunters' Lodges]], a secret anti-British, American militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes. They launched the Patriot War in 1838\u201339.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greer|first=Allan|title=1837\u201338: Rebellion Reconsidered|journal=Canadian Historical Review|year=1995|volume=LXVII|issue=1|pages=1\u201330|doi=10.3138/chr-076-01-01 }}</ref>\n\n[[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|John Lambton, Lord Durham]]'s support for \"[[responsible government]]\" undercut the Tories and gradually led the public to reject what it viewed as poor administration, unfair land and education policies, and inadequate attention to urgent transportation needs. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham's report]] led to the administrative unification of Upper and Lower Canada as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Responsible government did not occur until the late 1840s under [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]].<ref>{{harvp|Careless|1967|pp=113\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Sydenham and the Union of the Canadas===\n{{wikisource|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\n{{main|Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Province of Canada}}\n\nAfter the Rebellions, the new governor, [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham]], proved an exemplary [[Utilitarian]], despite his aristocratic pretensions. This combination of free trade and aristocratic pretensions needs to be underscored; although a liberal capitalist, Sydenham was no radical democrat. Sydenham approached the task of implementing those aspects of Durham's report that the colonial office approved of, municipal reform, and the union of the Canadas, with a \"campaign of state violence and coercive institutional innovation&nbsp;... empowered not just by the British state but also by his [[Benthamite]] certainties.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=The Liberal Order Framework: A prospectus for a reconnaissance of Canadian History|journal=Canadian Historical Review|year=2000|volume=81|issue=4|pages=616\u2013678|doi=10.3138/chr.81.4.616 }}</ref> Like governors Bond Head before him, and Metcalfe after, he was to turn to the [[Orange Order]] for often violent support. It was Sydenham who played a critical role in transforming Compact Tories into Conservatives.\n\nSydenham introduced a vast expansion of the state apparatus through the introduction of municipal government. Areas not already governed through civic corporations or police boards would be governed through centrally controlled District Councils with authority over roads, schools, and local policing. A strengthened Executive Council would further usurp much of the elected assembly's legislative role, leaving elected politician's to simply review the administration's legislative program and budgets.\n\n==Settlement==\n\n===First Nations dispossession and reserves===\n{{main|First Nations in Ontario|Anishinaabe|Iroquois}}\n\nThe First Nations occupying the territory that was to become Upper Canada were:\n\n*'''Anishinaabe''' or '''Anishinabe'''\u2014or more properly (plural) '''Anishinaabeg''' or '''Anishinabek'''. The plural form of the word is the [[endonym|autonym]] often used by the [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odawa]], [[Ojibwa|Ojibwe]], and [[Algonquin people]]s.\n* The '''Iroquois''', also known as the '''Haudenosaunee''' or the \"People of the [[Longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|Longhouse]]\",<ref name=\"English, 1999\">Haudenosaunee is {{IPAc-en|h|\u0254\u02d0|d|\u025b|n|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|n|i\u02d0}} in English, ''Akun\u0119hsy\u0119\u0300ni\u02c0'' in [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]] (Rudes, B., ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999), and ''Rotinonsionni'' in [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]].</ref>\n\nPrior to the creation of Upper Canada in 1791 much land had already been ceded by the First Nations to the Crown in accordance with the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] most of the First Nations supported the British. After the Americans [[Sullivan Expedition|launched a campaign]] that burned the villages of the Iroquois in New York State in 1779<ref>{{harvp|Mintz|1999|p=}}</ref> the refugees fled to Fort Niagara and other British posts, and remained permanently in Canada.[[Image:Province of Quebec 1774.gif|thumb|280px|The [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] in 1774]]Land was granted to these allied Six Nations who had served on the British side during the American Revolution by the [[Haldimand Proclamation]] (1784). Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the [[Mississaugas]]. The nature of the grant has been under [[Grand River land dispute|dispute]].\n\n===Loyalists and the land grant system===\n{{main|United Empire Loyalist}}\n[[File:Province of Upper-Canada land deed.jpg|thumb|An 1824 land deed for Upper Canada]]\nCrown land policy to 1825 was multi-fold in the use of a \"free\" resource that had value to people who themselves may have little or no money for its purchase and for the price of settling upon it to support themselves and a create a new society. First, the cash-strapped Crown government in Canada could pay and reward the services and loyalty of the \"United Empire Loyalists\" who, originated outside of Canada, without encumbrance of debt by being awarded with small portions of land (under {{convert|200|acre|ha|disp=or|sigfig=1}}) with the proviso that it be settled by those to which it was granted; Second, portions would be reserved for the future use of the Crown and the clergy that did not require settlement by which to gain control. Lt. Governor Simcoe saw this as the mechanism by which an aristocracy might be created,<ref>{{harvp|Gates|1968|p=}}</ref> and that compact settlement could be avoided with the grants of large tracts of land to those Loyalists not required to settle on it as the means of gaining control.\n\n====Assisted immigration====\n{{main|Calton weavers|Petworth Emigration Scheme}}\n\nThe '''Calton weavers''' were a community of handweavers established in the community of [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]], then in [[Lanarkshire]] just outside [[Glasgow]], Scotland in the 18th century.<ref>Calton is now within Glasgow itself.</ref> In the early 19th century, many of the weavers emigrated to Canada, settling in [[Carleton Place, Ontario|Carleton Place]] and other communities in eastern [[Ontario]], where they continued their trade.<ref name=campey>{{harvp|Campey|2005|p=52ff}}</ref>\n\nIn 1825, 1,878 [[Irish Immigrants]] from the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] arrived in the community of Scott's Plains. The British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish families to Upper Canada in 1822. The scheme was managed by [[Peter Robinson (1785\u20131838)|Peter Robinson]], a member of the Family Compact and brother of the Attorney General. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour.\n\n====Talbot settlement====\n{{main|Talbot settlement}}\n\n[[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Thomas Talbot]] emigrated in 1791, where he became personal secretary to [[John Graves Simcoe]], Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Talbot convinced the government to allow him to implement a land settlement scheme of {{convert|5000|acre|ha|sigfig=1}} in Elgin County in the townships of Dunwich and Aldborough in 1803.<ref>{{harvp|Humber|1991|p=193}}</ref> According to his government agreement, he was entitled to {{convert|200|acre|ha|sigfig=1}} for every settler who received {{convert|50|acre|ha}}; in this way he gained an estate of {{convert|20000|acre|ha|sigfig=1}}. Talbot's administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers' names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, erasing their entry. Talbot's abuse of power was a contributing factor in the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=142\u2013144}}</ref>\n\n===Crown and clergy reserves===\n{{main|Clergy reserve|Clergy Corporation}}\n\nThe Crown reserves, one seventh of all lands granted, were to provide the provincial executive with an independent source of revenue not under the control of the elected Assembly. The clergy reserves, also one seventh of all lands granted in the province, were created \"for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy\" in lieu of tithes. The revenue from the lease of these lands was claimed by the Rev. [[John Strachan]] on behalf of the [[Church of England]]. These reserves were directly administered by the Crown; which, in turn, came under increasing political pressure from other Protestant bodies. The Reserve lands were to be a focal point of dissent within the Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=171\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe Clergy Corporation was incorporated in 1819 to manage the clergy reserves. After the Rev. [[John Strachan]] was appointed to the Executive Council, the advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor, in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England's autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. Although all clergymen in the Church of England were members of the body corporate, the act prepared in 1819 by Strachan's former student, Attorney General [[John Beverly Robinson]], also appointed the Inspector General and the Surveyor General to the board, and made a quorum of three for meetings; these two public officers also sat on the Legislative Council with Strachan.

The Upper Canadian state ended its policy of granting land to \"unofficial\" settlers and implemented a broad plan of revenue-generating sales. The Crown replaced its old policy of land grants to ordinary settlers in newly opened districts with land sales by auction. It also passed legislation that allowed the auctioning of previously granted land for payment of back-taxes.<ref name=Schrauwers2010>{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=The Gentlemanly Order & the Politics of Production in the Transition to Capitalism in the Home District, Upper Canada|journal=Labour/Le Travail|year=Spring 2010|volume=65|issue=1|pages=26\u201331|jstor=20798984}}</ref>\n\n===Canada Company===\n{{main|Canada Company}}\n[[File:Canada Company Office 1834.jpg|thumbnail|left|Canada Company Office, 1834]]\n{{rquote|right|The greater portion of British emigrants, arriving in Canada without funds and the most exalted ideas of the value and productiveness of land, purchase extensively on credit...

The Lieutenant Governor increasingly found himself depending upon the customs duties shared with, but collected in Lower Canada for revenue; after a dispute with the lower province on the relative proportions to be allocated to each, these duties were withheld, forcing the Lieutenant Governor to search for new sources of revenue. The Canada Company was created as a means of generating government revenue that was not under the control of the elected Assembly, thereby granting the Lt. Governor greater independence from local voters.\n\nThe plan for the Canada Company was promoted by the province's Attorney General, [[John Beverly Robinson]], then studying law at Lincoln's Inn in London. The Lt. Governor's financial crisis led to a quick adoption of Robinson's scheme to sell the Crown reserves to a new land company which would provide the provincial government with annual payments of between \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000. The Canada Company was chartered in London in 1826; after three years of mismanagement by [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]], the company hired [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]] and [[Thomas Mercer Jones]] to manage the company's Upper Canadian business. Jones was to manage the \"[[Huron Tract]],\" and Allan to sell the Crown reserves already surveyed in other districts.<ref>{{harvp|Lee|2004|pp=98\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Canada Company, \"the poorest individual can here procure for himself and family a valuable tract; which, with a little labour, he can soon convert into a comfortable home, such as he could probably never attain in any other country&nbsp;\u2013 all his own!\" However, recent studies have suggested that a minimum of \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 plus the cost of land was required to start a new farm in the bush.

However, due to the lack of a detailed breakdown, it is difficult to count each group, and this may be considered abuse of statistics. An idea of the ethnic breakdown can be had if one considers the religious census of 1842, which is helpfully provided below: Roman Catholics were 15% of the population, and adherents to this religion were, at the time, mainly drawn from the Irish and the French settlers. The Roman Catholic faith also numbered some votaries from amongst the Scottish settlers.

Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1668, and [[Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]] in 1701. Southern Ontario was part of the ''Pays d'en-haut'' (Upper Country) of [[New France]], and later part of the province of Quebec until Quebec was split into Upper and [[Lower Canada]] in 1791. The first wave of settlement in the Detroit/Windsor area came in the 18th century during the French regime. A second wave came in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the areas of Eastern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. In the [[Ottawa Valley]], in particular, some families have moved back and forth across the Ottawa River for generations (the river is the border between Ontario and Quebec). In the city of [[Ottawa]] some areas such as Vanier and Orleans have a rich Franco-heritage where families often have members on both sides of the [[Ottawa River]].\n\n====Loyalists/Later Loyalists====\n{{main|United Empire Loyalist|Expulsion of the Loyalists}}\n\nAfter an initial group of about 7,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of \"late-Loyalists\" arrived in the late 1790s and were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown to obtain land if they came from the US. Their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. Following the War of 1812, the colonial government under Lt. Governor Gore took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. The tensions between the Loyalists and late Loyalists erupted in the \"Alien Question\" crisis in 1820\u201321 when the Bidwells (Barnabas and his son Marshall) sought election to the provincial assembly. They faced opponents who claimed they could not hold elective office because of their American citizenship. If the Bidwells were aliens so were the majority of the province. The issue was not resolved until 1828 when the Colonial government retroactively granted them citizenship.\n\n====Freed slaves====\nThe [[Act Against Slavery]] passed in Upper Canada on 9 July 1793. The 1793 \"Act against Slavery\" forbade the importation of any additional slaves and freed children. It did not grant freedom to adult slaves\u2014they were finally freed [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|by the British Parliament in 1833]]. As a consequence, many Canadian slaves fled south to New England and New York, where slavery was no longer legal. Many American slaves who had escaped from the South via the [[Underground Railroad]] or fleeing from the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] in the Ohio Valley came north to Ontario, a good portion settling on land lots and began farming.<ref>Cooper, Afua, \"Acts of Resistance: Black Men and Women Engage Slavery in Upper Canada, 1793\u20131803,\" ''Ontario History,'' Spring 2007, Vol. 99 Issue 1, pp 5\u201317</ref> It is estimated that thousands of escaped slaves entered Upper Canada from the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/underground-railroad|title=Underground Railroad|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====British====\n{{see also|Great Migration of Canada}}\nThe [[Great Migration of Canada|Great Migration from Britain]] from 1815 to 1850 has been numbered at 800,000.

Governor, Sir [[John Graves Simcoe]], sought to make the Church of England the [[Established Church]] of the province. To that end, he created the clergy reserves, the revenues of which were to support the church. The clergy reserves proved to be a long-term political issue, as other denominations, particularly the [[Church of Scotland]] (Presbyterians) sought a proportional share of the revenues. The Church of England was never numerically dominant in the province, as it was in England, especially in the early years when most of the American born Later Loyalists arrived. The growth of the Church of England depended largely on later British emigration for growth.\n\nThe Church was led by the Rev. [[John Strachan]] (1778\u20131867), a pillar of the [[Family Compact]]. Strachan was part of the oligarchic ruling class of the province, and besides leading the Church of England, also sat on the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, helped found the [[Bank of Upper Canada]], [[Upper Canada College]], and the [[University of Toronto]].\n\n====Catholic Church====\n{{main|Roman Catholicism in Canada|Alexander Macdonell (bishop)}}\n\nFather Alexander Macdonell was a Scottish Catholic priest who formed his evicted clan into '''''The Glengarry Fencibles''''' regiment, of which he served as chaplain. He was the first Catholic [[Royal Army Chaplains' Department|chaplain in the British Army]] since the [[Reformation]]. When the regiment was disbanded, Rev. Macdonell appealed to the government to grant its members a tract of land in Canada, and, in 1804, {{convert|160,000|acre|sigfig=1}} were provided in what is now [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]], Canada.\nIn 1815, he began his service as the first Roman Catholic Bishop at St. Raphael's Church in the Highlands of Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Parish of St. Raphael Glengarry Emigration of 1786 Bishop Alexander Macdonell 1762\u20131840 |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_STU/Plaque_Stormont44.html |website=ontarioplaques.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref> In 1819, he was appointed [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Upper Canada, which in 1826 was erected into a suffragan [[Diocese|bishopric]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Archdiocese of Quebec]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/multiculturalism|title=Multiculturalism|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921/ | title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

O'Grady, like Macdonell, had served as an army chaplain (to [[Connell James Baldwin]]'s soldiers in [[Brazil]]). O'Grady followed Baldwin to [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore Township]] in 1828. From January 1829 he was pastor of St. Paul's church in [[York, Upper Canada|York]]. Tensions between the Scottish and Irish came to a head when O'Grady was defrocked, in part for his activities in the Reform movement. He went on to edit a Reform newspaper in Toronto, the ''Canadian Correspondent''.\n\n====Ryerson and the Methodists====\n{{main|Egerton Ryerson|Methodist Episcopal Church}}\n\nThe undisputed leader of the highly fractious Methodists in Upper Canada was Egerton Ryerson, editor of their newspaper, ''[[The Christian Guardian]]''. Ryerson (1803\u20131882) was an itinerant minister&nbsp;\u2013 or circuit rider&nbsp;\u2013 in the Niagara area for the Methodist Episcopal Church&nbsp;\u2013 an American branch of Methodism. As British immigration increased, Methodism in Upper Canada was torn between those with ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the British [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]]. Ryerson used the ''Christian Guardian'' to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest.\n\n====Presbyterians====\n{{main|Presbyterian Church in Canada}}\n\nThe earliest Presbyterian ministers in Upper Canada came from various denominations based in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. The \"Presbytery of the Canadas\" was formed in 1818 primarily by Scottish [[Associate Presbyterian Church|Associate Presbyterian]] missionaries, yet independently of their mother denomination in the hope of including Presbyterian ministers of all stripes in Upper and Lower Canada.  Although successfully including members from Irish Associate, and American Presbyterian and Reformed denominations, the growing group of missionaries belonging to the Church of Scotland remained separate. Instead, in 1831, they formed their own \"Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in Connection with the Established Church of Scotland\". That same year the \"Presbytery of the Canadas\", having grown and been re-organized, became the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\". In its continued pursuit for Presbyterian unity (and a share of government funding from the clergy reserves for established churches) the United Synod sought a union with the Church of Scotland synod which it finally joined in 1840. However, some ministers had left the United Synod prior to this merger (including, notably, Rev. James Harris, Rev. William Jenkins, and Rev. Daniel Eastman). In the 1832 new Secessionist missionaries began to arrive, belonging to \"The United Associate Synod in Scotland\" (after 1847, the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]). Committed to the voluntarist principle of rejecting government funding they decided against joining the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\" and on Christmas Day 1834 formed the \"Missionary Presbytery of the Canadas\". Although this new presbytery was formed at Rev. James Harris's church in Toronto, he and his congregation remained independent from it. However, the voluntarist, Rev. Jenkins and his congregation in Richmond Hill joined the Missionary Presbytery a few years later. Rev. Eastman had left the United Synod in 1833 to form the \"Niagara Presbytery\" of the Presbyterian Church in the USA. After this presbytery dissolved following the Rebellion of 1837, he rejoined the United Synod which then joined the Church of Scotland. Outside of these four Presbyterian denominations, only two others gained a foothold in the province. The small \"Stamford Presbytery\" of the American Secessionist tradition was formed in 1835 in the Niagara region, and the Scottish Reformed Presbyterian or \"Covenanter\" tradition was represented in the province to an even lesser extent. Despite the numerous denominations, by the late 1830s, the Church of Scotland was the main expression of Presbyterianism in Upper Canada.\n\n====Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers, and Children of Peace====\n[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Sharon Temple]], built by the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]]]]\n{{main|Mennonite|Society of Friends (Upper Canada)|The Children of Peace}}\n\nThese groups of later Loyalists were proportionately larger in the early decades of the province's settlement. The Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers and Children of Peace are the traditional Peace churches. The Mennonites and [[Tunkers]] were generally German-speaking and immigrated as Later Loyalists from Pennsylvania. Many of their descendants continue to speak a form of [[German language|German]] called [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]. The Quakers (Society of Friends) immigrated from New York, the New England States and Pennsylvania. The Children of Peace were founded during the War of 1812 after a schism in the Society of Friends in York County.<ref>{{harvp|Reaman|1957|pp=40\u2013124}}</ref> A further schism occurred in 1828, leaving two branches, \"Orthodox\" Quakers and \"Hicksite\" Quakers.\n\n===Poverty===\n{{see also|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}\nIn the decade ending in 1837, the population of Upper Canada doubled, to 397,489, fed in large part by erratic spurts of displaced paupers, the \"surplus population\" of the British Isles. Historian Rainer Baehre estimated that between 1831 and 1835 a bare minimum of one-fifth of all emigrants to the province arrived totally destitute, forwarded by their parishes in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baehre|first=Rainer|title=Pauper Emigration to Upper Canada in the 1830s|journal=Historie Sociale/Social History|year=1981|volume=XIV|issue=28 |pages=340}}</ref> The pauper immigrants arriving in Toronto were the excess agricultural workers and artisans whose growing ranks sent the cost of parish-based poor relief in England spiralling; a financial crisis that generated frenetic public debate and the overhaul of the [[Poor Laws]] in 1834. \"Assisted emigration,\" a second solution to the problem touted by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Colonial Office, Robert Wilmot Horton, would remove them permanently from the parish poor rolls.\n\nThe roots of Wilmot-Horton's \"assisted emigration\" policies began in April 1820, in the middle of an [[Radical War|insurrection in Glasgow]], where a young, already twice bankrupted [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was setting sail for Canada on a ship called Psyche. After the week-long violence, the rebellion was easily crushed; the participants were driven less by treason than distress. In a city of 147,000 people without a regular parish system of poor relief, between ten and fifteen thousand were destitute. The Prime Minister agreed to provide free transportation from Quebec to Upper Canada, a {{convert|100|acre|adj=on}} land grant, and a year's supply of provisions to any of the rebellious weavers who could pay their own way to Quebec. In all, in 1820 and 1821, a private charity helped 2,716 Lanarkshire and Glasgow emigrants to Upper Canada to take up their free grants, primarily in the [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] area.<ref>{{harvp|Johnston|1972|pp=51\u201354}}</ref> A second project was the [[Petworth Emigration Scheme|Petworth Emigration Committee]] organised by the Reverend Thomas Sockett, who chartered ships and sent emigrants from England to Canada in each of the six years between 1832 and 1837.<ref>{{harvp|Cameron|Maude|2000|p=}}</ref> This area in the south of England was terrorised by the [[Captain Swing|Captain Swing Riots]], a series of clandestine attacks on large farmers who refused relief to unemployed agricultural workers. The area hardest hit&nbsp;\u2013 Kent&nbsp;\u2013 was the area where [[Sir Francis Bond Head]], later Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836, was the [[Poor Law Commissioner|Assistant Poor Law Commissioner]]. One of his jobs was to force the unemployed into \"Houses of Industry.\"\n\n==Trade, monetary policy, and financial institutions==\n\n===Corporations===\n{{main|Corporations (Upper Canada)}}\nThere were two types of corporate actors at work in the Upper Canadian economy: the legislatively [[chartered companies]] and the unregulated [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]]. The joint stock company was popular in building public works, since it should be for general public benefit, as the benefit would otherwise be sacrificed to legislated monopolies with exclusive privileges. or lie dormant. An example of the legislated monopoly is found in the [[Bank of Upper Canada]]. However, the benefit of the joint-stock shareholders, as the risk takers, was whole and entire; and the general public benefitted only indirectly. As late as 1849, even the moderate reform politician [[Robert Baldwin]] was to complain that \"unless a stop were made to it, there would be nothing but corporations from one end of the country to the other.\" Radical reformers, like [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], who opposed all \"legislated monopolies,\" saw joint stock associations as the only protection against \"the whole property of the country... being tied up as an irredeemable appendage to incorporated institutions, and put beyond the reach of individual possession.\"<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|page=21}}</ref> As a result, most of the joint-stock companies formed in this period were created by [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|political reformers]] who objected to the legislated monopolies granted to members of the [[Family Compact]].\n\n===Currency and banking===\n\n====Currency====\n{{see also|Coinage of Upper Canada}}\n\nThe government of Upper Canada never issued a provincial currency. A variety of coins, mainly of French, Spanish, English and American origin circulated. The government used the Halifax standard, where one pound Halifax equalled four Spanish dollars. One [[pound sterling]] equalled \u00a31 2s 2\u00bed (until 1820), and \u00a31 2s 6\u00bdd Halifax pounds after 1820.\n\nPaper currency was issued primarily by the Bank of Upper Canada, although with the diversification of the banking system, each bank would issue its own distinctive notes.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1993|pp=245247}}</ref>\n\n====Bank of Upper Canada====\n{{main|Bank of Upper Canada}}\n[[File:Bank of Upper Canada.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Bank of Upper Canada, Toronto]]\nThe Bank of Upper Canada was \"captured\" from Kingston merchants by the York elite at the instigation of [[John Strachan]] in 1821, with the assistance of [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]], a Toronto merchant and Executive Councillor. York was too small to warrant such an institution as indicated by the inability of its promoters to raise even the minimal 10% of the \u00a3200,000 authorised capital required for start-up. It succeeded where the Bank of Kingston had failed only because it had the political influence to have this minimum reduced by half, and because the provincial government subscribed for two thousand of its eight thousand shares. The administration appointed four of the bank's fifteen directors that, as with the [[Clergy Corporation]], made for a tight bond between the nominally private company and the state. Forty-four men served as bank directors during the 1830s; eleven of them were executive councillors, fifteen of them were legislative councillors, and thirteen were magistrates in Toronto. More importantly, all 11 men who had ever sat on the Executive Council also sat on the board of the Bank at one time or another. 10 of these men also sat on the Legislative Council. The overlapping membership on the boards of the Bank of Upper Canada and on the Executive and Legislative Councils served to integrate the economic and political activities of church, state, and the \"financial sector.\" These overlapping memberships reinforced the oligarchic nature of power in the colony and allowed the administration to operate without any effective elective check. The Bank of Upper Canada was a political sore point for the [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reformers]] throughout the 1830s.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2010|pages=22\u201326}}</ref>\n\n====Bank wars: the Scottish joint-stock banks====\n{{main|Bank of the People}}\nThe difference between the chartered banks and the joint-stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint-stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The formation of new joint-stock banks blossomed in 1835 in the aftermath of a parliamentary report by Dr [[Charles Duncombe (Upper Canada Rebellion)|Charles Duncombe]], which established their legality here. Duncombe's report drew in large part on an increasingly dominant banking orthodoxy in the United Kingdom which challenged the English system of chartered banks. Duncombe's Select Committee on Currency offered a template for the creation of joint-stock banks based on several successful British banks. Within weeks two Devonshire businessmen, Capt. George Truscott and John Cleveland Green, established the \"Farmer's Bank\" in Toronto. The only other successful bank established under this law was \"[[Bank of the People|The Bank of the People]]\" which was set up by Toronto's Reformers. The Bank of the People provided the loan that allowed [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] to establish the newspaper The Constitution in 1836 in the lead up to the Rebellion of 1837. Mackenzie wrote at the time: \"Archdeacon Strachan's bank (the old one)&nbsp;... serve the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer's acres under the harrow of the storekeeper.

It was during this period that the three largest pre-war merchants who imported directly from Britain retired from business as a result; Quetton St. George in 1815, [[Alexander Wood (merchant)|Alexander Wood]] in 1821, and [[William Allan (banker)|William Allan]] in 1822. Toronto and Kingston then underwent a boom in the number of increasingly specialised shops and wholesalers.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|page=107}}</ref> The Toronto wholesale firm of [[Isaac Buchanan]] and Company were one of the largest of the new wholesalers. Isaac Buchanan was a Scots merchant in Toronto, in partnership with his brother Peter, who remained in Glasgow to manage the British end of the firm. They established their business in Toronto in 1835, having bought out Isaac's previous partners, William Guild and Co., who had established themselves in Toronto in 1832. As a wholesale firm, the Buchanan's had invested more than \u00a310,000 in their business.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1979|p=28}}</ref>\n\nAnother of those new wholesale businesses was the [[Farmers' Storehouse Company]]. The Farmers Storehouse Company was formed in the Home District and is probably Canada's first [[Farmers' cooperatives|Farmers' Cooperative]]. The Storehouse expedited the sale of farmer's wheat to Montreal, and provided them with cheaper consumer goods.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=102\u2013106}}</ref>\n\n====Wheat and grains====\n{{main|Agriculture in Upper Canada|Corn Laws}}\nUpper Canada was in the unenviable position of having few exports with which to pay for all its imported manufactured needs. For the vast majority of those who settled in rural areas, debt could be paid off only through the sale of wheat and flour; yet, throughout much of the 1820s, the price of wheat went through periodic cycles of boom and bust depending upon the British markets that ultimately provided the credit upon which the farmer lived.\nIn the decade 1830\u201339, exports of wheat averaged less than \u00a31 per person a year (less than \u00a36 per household), and in the 1820s just half that.<ref>{{harvp|McCalla|1993|p=75}}</ref>\n\nGiven the small amounts of saleable wheat and flour, and the rarity of cash, some have questioned how market oriented these early farmers were. Instead of depending on the market to meet their needs, many of these farmers depended on networks of shared resources and cooperative marketing. For example, rather than hire labour, they met their labour needs through \"work bees.\" such farmers are said to be 'subsistence oriented' and not to respond to market cues; rather, they engage in a [[moral economy]] seeking 'subsistence insurance' and a '[[just price]]'. [[The Children of Peace]] in the village of Hope (now [[Sharon, Ontario|Sharon]]) are a well documented example. They were the most prosperous agricultural community in [[Canada West]] by 1851.<ref>{{harvp|Schrauwers|2009|pages=41\u201350}}</ref>\n\n====Timber====\n{{main|Ottawa River timber trade}}\n\nThe Ottawa River timber trade resulted from Napoleon's 1806 [[Continental Blockade]] in Europe. The United Kingdom required a new source of timber for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the UK's application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The trade in squared timber lasted until the 1850s. The transportation of raw timber by means of [[Timber rafting|floating]] down the Ottawa River was proved possible in 1806 by [[Philemon Wright]].<ref>{{harvp|Woods|1980|p=89}}</ref> Squared timber would be assembled into [[timber rafting|large rafts]] which held living quarters for men on their six-week journey to [[Quebec City]], which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe timber trade was Upper and [[Lower Canada]]'s major industry in terms of employment and value of the product.<ref>{{harvp|Greening|1961|pp=111}}</ref> The largest supplier of square red and white pine to the British market was the [[Ottawa River]]<ref>{{harvp|Greening|1961|p=111}}</ref> and the [[Ottawa Valley]].

The [[Erie Canal]], stretching from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York, threatened to divert all of the grain and other trade on the upper Great Lakes through the [[Hudson River]] to New York city after its completion in 1825. Upper Canadians sought to build a similar system that would tie this trade to the [[St Lawrence River]] and [[Montreal]].\n\n====Rideau Canal====\n\nThe Rideau Canal's purpose was military and hence was paid for by the British and not the local treasury. It was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston. The objective was to bypass the [[St. Lawrence River]] bordering New York; a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to an attack. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the [[Ottawa River]] to [[Bytown]] (now [[Ottawa]]), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. Because the Rideau Canal was easier to navigate than the St. Lawrence River due to the series of rapids between Montreal and Kingston, it became a busy commercial artery from Montreal to the Great Lakes. The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John By]] of the [[Royal Engineers]]. The work started in 1826, and was completed 6 years later in 1832 at a cost of \u00a3822,000.\n\n====Welland Canal====\n\nThe Welland Canal was created to directly link Lake Erie with Lake Ontario, bypassing Niagara Falls and the Erie Canal. It was the idea of [[William Hamilton Merritt]] who owned a sawmill, grist mill and store on the [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. The Legislature authorised the joint-stock Welland Canal Company on 19 January 1824, with a capitalisation of $150,000, and Merritt as the agent. The canal was officially opened exactly five years later on 30 November 1829. However, the original route to Lake Erie followed the Welland and Niagara Rivers and was difficult and slow to navigate. The Welland Canal Company obtained a loan of 50,000 pounds from the Province of Upper Canada in March 1831 to cut a canal directly to Gravelly Bay (now [[Port Colborne, Ontario|Port Colborne]]) as the new Lake Erie terminus for the canal.<ref>{{harvp|Craig|1963|pages=153\u2013160}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the canal was finished in 1837, it had cost the province \u00a3425,000 in loans and stock subscriptions. The Company was supposed to have been a private one using private capital; but the province had little private capital available, hence most of the original funds came from New York. To keep the canal in Upper Canadian hands, the province had passed a law barring Americans from the company's directorate. The company was thus controlled by the Family Compact, even though they had few shares. By 1834, it was clear the canal would never make money and that the province would be on the hook for the large loans; the canal and the canal company thus became a political issue, as local farmers argued the huge expense would ultimately only benefit American farmers in the west and the merchants who transported their grain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aitken|first=Hugh G.T.|title=Yates and McIntyre: Lottery Managers|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1953|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36\u201357|doi=10.1017/S0022050700070030}}</ref>\n\n====Desjardins Canal====\nThe '''Desjardins Canal''', named after its promoter Pierre Desjardins, was built to give [[Dundas, Ontario]], easier access to [[Burlington Bay]] and [[Lake Ontario]]. Access to Lake Ontario from Dundas was made difficult by the topography of the area, which included a natural sand and gravel barrier, across Burlington Bay which allowed only boats with a shallow draft through. In 1823 a canal was dug through the sandbar. In 1826 the passage was completed, allowing schooners to sail to neighbouring [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. Hamilton then became a major port and quickly expanded as a centre of trade and commerce. In 1826 a group of Dundas businessmen incorporated to compete with Hamilton and increase the value of their real estate holdings. The project to build Desjardins Canal continued for ten years, from 1827 to 1837, and required constant infusions of money from the province. In 1837, the year it opened, the company's income was \u00a36,000, of which \u00a35,000 was from a government loan and \u00a3166 was received from canal tolls.\n\n===Lake traffic: steamships===\n\n{{main|Great Lakes passenger steamers}}\nThere is disagreement as to whether the Canadian-built {{ship|PS|Frontenac||2}} ({{convert|170|ft|m|disp=comma}}), launched on 7 September 1816, at Ernestown, Ontario or the US-built ''Ontario'' ({{convert|110|ft|m|disp=comma}}), launched in the spring of 1817 at Sacketts Harbor, New York, was the first steamboat on the Great Lakes.

The white-dominated state legislature in the 1880s passed four laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] and many poor whites, particularly due to the requirement of payment of a [[poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in order to register to vote. This reduced the competitiveness of the Republican Party in the state for more than six decades, and thus it effectively held political power only in eastern Tennessee.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

As of 2009, it was estimated that the total minority fraction of the population had grown to almost 20% of the total, with Hispanic population at 5.58%, African-American population at 12.09%, and Asian population at 2.66% of the total.<ref>[http://www.rutherfordchamber.org/economic-development/shared/demographics/rutherford-co-demog.pdf Rutherford County Pop-Facts: Demographic Snapshot Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107122127/http://www.rutherfordchamber.org/economic-development/shared/demographics/rutherford-co-demog.pdf |date=2007-11-07 }} from the Rutherford Chamber of Commerce</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\nThe Board of County Commissioners, the county legislative body, consists of 21 members elected for four-year terms from [[single-member districts]] based on roughly equal populations. The county mayor is the chief executive officer and is elected from the county [[at-large]].\n\n===Political parties===\nThis area of the state was predominately Democratic following the [[American Civil War]], but the significant minority of African Americans joined the Republican Party. The white-dominated state legislature in the 1880s passed four laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] and many poor whites, particularly due to the requirement of payment of a [[poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in order to register to vote. This reduced the competitiveness of the Republican Party in the state for more than six decades, and thus it effectively held political power only in eastern Tennessee.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
