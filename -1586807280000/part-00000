{"title_page": "La Junta Indians", "text_new": "'''La Junta Indians''' is a collective name for the various Indians living in the area known as ''La Junta de los Rios'' (\"the confluence of the rivers\": the [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Conchos River]]) on the borders of present-day West [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]].  In 1535 [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca]] recorded visiting these peoples while making his way to a Spanish settlement. They cultivated crops in the river floodplains, as well as gathering indigenous plants and catching fish from the rivers. They were part of an extensive trading network in the region.  As a crossroads, the area attracted people of different tribes.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the Spanish set up missions in the area and the Native Americans gradually lost their tribal identifications. After suffering severe population losses through [[infectious disease]], the Spanish [[slave trade]], and attacks by raiding [[Apache]] and [[Comanche]], the La Junta Indians disappeared. Some intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population of Mexico; others merged with the Apache and Comanche; still others departed to work on Spanish haciendas and in silver mines.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Rio Grande and the Conchos River unite near the present-day cities of [[Presidio, Texas]], and [[Ojinaga, Mexico]].  The Conchos is more than twice as large as the Rio Grande, but below the confluence the river is known as the Rio Grande.  The area was named ''La Junta'' by Spanish explorers for the confluence, or junction, of rivers.  A mile-wide floodplain extends from La Junta 35 miles upstream to Ruidosa and 18 miles downstream to Redford on the Rio Grande; it extends up the Rio Conchos 30 miles to Cuchillo Parado.  The floodplain supports a thick growth of reeds, mesquite, willows, and groves of cottonwood trees.\n\n[[File:Conchos_basin_map.png|thumb|right|200px|La Junta is located at the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande. The Conchos River is the larger of the two.]]\n\nTwo terraces rise 20 and 60 feet above the floodplain. Only desert vegetation grows on the terraces. The La Junta Indians lived on the terraces and used the floodplain for agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering wild foods. Rugged mountains ring the river valley and terraces.<ref>Kelley, J. Charles, \"The Historic Indian Pueblos of La Junta de Los Rios,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Vol. 27, No, 4, Oct 1952, 258-260</ref>  \nLa Junta is near the center of the [[Chihuahua Desert]] and receives an average of 10.8&nbsp;inches (270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually.

Settled village life, with agriculture supplementing traditional hunting and gathering, began by 1200 A.D.<ref name=\"Junta\">[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/index.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Villagers of the Chihuahuan Desert Rivers\"], ''Texas Beyond History,'' 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref> Archaeologists suggest that La Junta was settled as an expansion southeastward of the Jornada [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] culture and people who lived around present-day [[El Paso, Texas]], 200 miles up the Rio Grande.  It may also have been influenced by [[Casas Grandes]], a notable prehistoric Indian civilization of the late 14th century located 200 miles west in present-day Mexico. Its people built complex communities with multi-story buildings and used highly developed irrigation systems to support agriculture.\n   \nBased on recent research of architectural styles and mortuary practices, scholars believe that the people of La Junta may have been indigenous to the area.  Between 1450 and 1500 many of the Jornada Mogollon settlements in western Texas were abandoned, possibly because of drought that made agriculture infeasible. The inhabitants possibly reverted to a hunter-gatherer culture that has left few traces in the archaeological record. The settlements at La Junta apparently survived the drought, although changes in the types of dwellings occurred and distinctive, locally produced pottery became common\u2014or more common.<ref>Miller, Myles R. and Kenmotsu, Nancy A. \"Prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas,\" In Perttula, Timothy, ''The Prehistory of Texas''.  College Station: Texas A & M U Press, 2004, pp. 258-260</ref>\n\nThe architectural styles of the houses and mortuary practices differ from the Mogollon. Most of the pottery at La Junta from prehistoric times is Jornada Mogollon, but archeologists believe that it was imported by trading rather than locally produced.  La Junta eventually produced its own distinct style of pottery, although perhaps not until about 1500 A.D.  The La Junta people, although influenced by the Mogollon culture, may have been a different linguistic and ethnic group.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/reconsidered.html \"La Junta de los Rios: La Junta Reconsidered\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref>\n\nResearch on bones and teeth indicates that the La Junta people continued to be dependent on hunting and gathering even after they became settled villagers and adopted agriculture. Researchers were surprised to learn that the peoples received less than 25 percent of their subsistence from maize; the rest came from game and wild foods. This is in contrast to typical agricultural cultures in which people received the majority of nutrition from cultivated crops.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/insights.html \"La Junta de los Rios: New Insights\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29,2010</ref>\n\nLittle of their language, or languages, was recorded; scholars have not agreed on the language of the La Junta people. The most common guess is that they spoke [[Uto-Aztecan]], but [[Kiowa\u2013Tanoan]] and [[Athapaskan]] ([[Apache]]) have also been suggested.  As the La Junta people lived at a crossroads in the desert, they may have been different ethnic groups who spoke multiple languages. For instance, the nomadic [[Jumano Indians|Jumano]] were frequent visitors and trading partners; they may also have been part-time residents of the area and were known to be ethnically distinct from the full-time villagers.<ref>Riley, Carroll L. ''The Frontier People: The Greater Southwest in the Protohistoric Period''. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1987, p. 297-298</ref>\n\nGiven the limited amount of land suitable for agriculture and the austere environment, scholars estimate a population of 3,000 or 4,000 people at La Junta.  But, the Spanish explorer [[Antonio de Espejo]] estimated the area's population at more than 10,000. The modern scholar Howard G. Applegate has calculated that the resources were sufficient to support such a population,<ref>Applegate, Howard G. \"The Demography of La Junta de los Rios del Norte y Conchos,\" ''The Journal of Big Bend Studies,'' Vol IV, 1972, pp. 43-73</ref> but others disagree. The population during the year probably varied, as many of the Indians were semi-nomadic. The Spanish referred to the various peoples at La Junta as Amotomancos, Otomoacos, Abriaches, Julimes, and Patarabueyes. They were sometimes collectively called Jumano, although that name may more properly apply to the nomadic [[bison|buffalo]] hunters who also frequented La Junta.<ref>Riley (1987), \"The Frontier People\", pp. 293-296</ref>\n\n==Spanish encounters==\n[[File:Expedition Cabeza de Vaca Karte.png|thumb|left|500px|Cabeza de Vaca's route. La Junta is the area of the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande.]]\n\nThe Spanish castaway Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca probably passed through or near La Junta in 1535 on his way to a Spanish settlement.  He reported encountering \"the people of the cows\" and said they were \"people with the best bodies that we saw and the greatest liveliness.\"<ref>Kreiger, Alex D. ''We Came Naked and Barefoot: The Journey of Cabeza de Vaca across North America''. Austin: U of TX Press, 2002, pp. 86-87</ref> These were likely the Jumano, buffalo-hunting Indians who lived further north and east along the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and [[Concho River|Concho]] rivers, and traded and wintered in the La Junta region. Cabeza de Vaca described the area as well populated and agricultural, although with little good land.  The Indians had not planted corn for the previous two years because of drought.  Cabeza De Vaca noted that they put hot stones in gourds to cook their food. They were not described as using pottery; like other nomadic peoples, they found it too heavy to be easily carried.  (The Indians did not adopt horses from the Spanish until the 17th century.)<ref>Kreiger (2002), \"We Came Naked\", pp. 86-87</ref>\n\nIn the 1580s, two small Spanish expeditions, that of [[Chamuscado and Rodriguez Expedition|Chamuscado and Rodriguez]] and the later [[Antonio de Espejo]], passed through La Junta.  They reported that the men were \"handsome\" and the women \"beautiful,\" although \"naked and barbarous people.\"<ref>Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, ''The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580-1594.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1996, pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>  The Indians lived in low, flat-roofed houses; grew corn, squash and beans; and hunted and fished along the river.  They gave the Spaniards well-tanned deer and buffalo skins. The expeditions' descriptions of La Junta indicated a more settled agricultural people than those described 50 years earlier by Cabeza de Vaca.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), ''Rediscovery of New Mexico'', pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>\n\nThey wrote that the houses at La Junta resembled \n\n<blockquote>those of the Mexicans ... The natives built them square. They put up forked posts and in those they place rounded timbers the thickness of a man's thigh. Then they add stakes and plaster them with mud. Close to the houses they have granaries built of willow ... where they keep their provisions and harvest of mesquite and other things.<ref name=\"Riley 1997\">Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 301</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis type of house is called a ''[[jacal]]''.

Agriculture under such conditions is risky; the people also depended on gathering wild foods such as mesquite, prickly pears, and agaves. They caught catfish in the rivers. Some of the La Junta Indians journeyed to the [[Great Plains]] 150 or more miles northeast to hunt buffalo or trade for buffalo meat with the nomadic Jumano.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 298-300</ref>\n\nThe Spanish found the Rio Grande Valley well-populated north to present-day [[El Paso, Texas]].  Beyond there, they encountered no people until the [[Pueblo]] settlements fifteen days' travel upriver from El Paso. Above La Junta they encountered peoples later called the [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]] and [[Manso Indians]].  They seem to have been less agricultural and more nomadic than the people of La Junta.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), \"Rediscovery of New Mexico\", pp. 216-220</ref>\n\nBased on the development of their weapons and shields, warfare between the La Junta Indians and their neighbors seemed common.  Spanish explorers described composite bows strengthened with buffalo sinews and \"excellent shields\" of buffalo hide.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", p. 306</ref>\n\nSlave raids at La Junta by the Spanish may have begun as early as 1563; at about the same time that [[Apache]] Indians began raiding from the north. The Spanish transported captured La Junta Indians to work as laborers in the silver mines of [[Parral, Chihuahua]].<ref>\"Texas Beyond History\", http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/encounters.html, accessed 25 February 2015</ref>\n\n== Later history ==\nAfter the Spanish found shorter routes to travel north to their colonies in New Mexico, they bypassed La Junta.  It became a quiet backwater of little interest except to slavers and priests. In the 17th century, the accumulated losses due to Eurasian [[infectious diseases]], and Apache and Spanish raids caused the population to diminish.\n \nIn 1683, [[Juan Sabeata]], a Jumano, re-ignited Spanish interest in La Junta. He appealed to the governor in El Paso to send priests to the area, saying that the Indians wanted to become Christian. Sabeata also asked the Spanish to help the La Junta to defend against the Apache.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jumanos.html?id=P1-s3oSudIIC Hickerson, Nancy Parrott.

The Spanish appointed Sabeata as governor and La Junta became temporarily prominent as a regional trade center, but Sabeata could not gain Spanish assistance to combat the Apache.\n\nWhen the Indians all over northern Mexico revolted in 1689 to protest the continuing [[slave trade]], the missions in La Junta were closed.  The Spanish tried to reestablish a foothold there; a party visited in 1715, when they found the population had declined to 2,100.  They did not build a fort and mission until 1760. By this time the La Junta Indians had further declined in number. Many of the survivors soon left the area, discouraged by the harshness of Spanish rule, continuing Apache raids, and a new threat from the [[Comanche]], who had moved south from [[Colorado]].  Some La Junta Indians were forcibly transported to work in the silver mines of Parral; others intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population; and still others joined their former enemies, the Apache and the Comanche.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.netjunta/frontier.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Spanish Frontier\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, Accessed Nov 30, 2010</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:La Junta Indians}}\n[[Category:Native American tribes in Texas]]\n[[Category:Indigenous peoples in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Native American history of Texas]]\n[[Category:Archaeology of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "'''La Junta Indians''' is a collective name for the various Indians living in the area known as ''La Junta de los Rios'' (\"the confluence of the rivers\": the [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Conchos River]]) on the borders of present-day West [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]].

Barnett's grandson, Doug Barnett, gives the date 1884. He writes: \"In February 1883 he travelled north in a buckboard with four horses as far as the Red Deer River. The only source of supplies was by a wagon train running every week or so between Calgary and Edmonton. Ed came across a couple of drifters and the three of them built a log cabin by the Red Deer River where they remained over the winter of 1883-84. They survived the winter on a diet of rabbit and flour until spring brought a welcome addition of ducks and geese from the south. Barnett was still looking for a good place to start ranching and farming. He therefore moved farther north in the summer of 1884, across the Blindman River to the area where Lacombe stands today.\" See [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed+Barnett%3A+from+mountie+to+rancher.-a0167508634 Barnett, Doug.

Along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail, he established a \"[[stopping house]]\" for travelers on a land grant given to him for serving his service in the NWMP.
