Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing. Someday the Gascon will get caught.\"<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 135</ref> Subsequently, Bernadotte pursued, conjointly with Soult and [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] (known as the \"Pursuit of the Three Marshals\"), Prussian general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher's]] Corps to [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], where his troops stormed the Prussian defenses, taking the city<ref>Barton, D.

Bernadotte, struggling desperately to prevent his men from sacking, was given six horses from the Council of L\u00fcbeck as their appreciation.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). pp. 198\u201399</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 132\u201337</ref> He also treated captured Swedish soldiers with courtesy and allowed them to return to their home country. The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 172\u201376</ref> Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians. Bernadotte moved West as ordered, pursued by Bennigsen where he ably defeated the numerically superior Russian vanguard at [[Battle of Mohrungen|Mohrungen]] (25 January 1807).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Due to the capture of a courier carrying the Emperor's latest orders, Bernadotte was not informed of a change of strategy to move East toward the rest of the French Army. As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 178\u201383</ref> Due to this near fatal wound, Bernadotte was invalided to the rear and missed the remainder of the Polish Campaign.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Tilsit]], in 1808, as well-liked governor of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic towns]], where he once again proved his administrative and diplomatic abilities,<ref>Barton, pp. 197\u2013201</ref> he was to direct the expedition against Sweden, via the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands, but the plan came to naught because of the want of transports and the defection of the [[Division of the North|Spanish contingent]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Pursuant to the projected invasion of Sweden, and by virtue of Denmark becoming an ally of France in 1808, Bernadotte found himself de facto head of a French occupation of Denmark. However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing. Someday the Gascon will get caught.\"<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 135</ref> Subsequently, Bernadotte pursued, conjointly with Soult and [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] (known as the \"Pursuit of the Three Marshals\"), Prussian general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher's]] Corps to [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], where his troops stormed the Prussian defenses, taking the city<ref>Barton, D.

The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Directed by [[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] and written by [[Michael Mitnick]], the film stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Edison, [[Michael Shannon]] as Westinghouse, [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]], alongside [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Tuppence Middleton]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]] and [[Damien Molony]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] also serve as executive producers.\n\nAnnounced in May 2012, Gomez-Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2017.\n\nCo-produced by [[Harvey Weinstein]] and originally to be distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]], the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]]. It was eventually bought by [[Lantern Entertainment]] (the successor of TWC), who then sold the domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a [[final cut privilege]] clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez-Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1880 and [[Thomas Edison]] has unveiled his electric lightbulb and has decided on [[Direct Current]] (DC) which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight but it is limited in range and expensive. [[George Westinghouse]], a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove [[Alternating Current]] (AC) is the better technology as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Brilliant inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse.\n\nEdison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind the technical merits of AC. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high-voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck with personal tragedy when his friend [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]] dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \"[[The Phonograph]]\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily [[electrocution|electrocutes]] animals, and secretly works to help the creators of execution by [[electric chair]], despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is [[William Kemmler]], and newspapers label the event as \"Far Worse Than Hanging\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical [[AC motor]]. Edison is increasingly marginalized and [[J. P. Morgan]] merges Edison Electric into [[General Electric]]. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. [[Samuel Insull]] presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The abundantly lit fair is revealed. Westinghouse was successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention ([[Thomas Edison#Motion pictures|Motion Pictures]]) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[George Westinghouse]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]]\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Marguerite Erskine Walker\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]]\n* [[Simon Manyonda]] as [[Lewis Latimer]]\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]]\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as [[Thomas Edison#Marriages and children|Mary Stilwell Edison]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/memorial/5814 |title=Mary Stilwell Edison (1855 - 1884)|publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[J.

After the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein]] came to light, work on the film ceased as The Weinstein Company would eventually sell off the rights.

Directed by [[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] and written by [[Michael Mitnick]], the film stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Edison, [[Michael Shannon]] as Westinghouse, [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]], alongside [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Tuppence Middleton]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]] and [[Damien Molony]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] also serve as executive producers.\n\nAnnounced in May 2012, Gomez-Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2017.\n\nCo-produced by [[Harvey Weinstein]] and originally to be distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]], the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]]. It was eventually bought by [[Lantern Entertainment]] (the successor of TWC), who then sold the domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a [[final cut privilege]] clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez-Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1880 and [[Thomas Edison]] has unveiled his electric lightbulb and has decided on [[Direct Current]] (DC) which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight but it is limited in range and expensive. [[George Westinghouse]] a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove [[Alternating Current]] (AC) is the better technology as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Brilliant inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse.\n\nEdison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind the technical merits of AC. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high-voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck with personal tragedy when his friend [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]] dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \"[[The Phonograph]]\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily [[electrocution|electrocutes]] animals, and secretly works to help the creators of execution by [[electric chair]], despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is [[William Kemmler]], and newspapers label the event as \"Far Worse Than Hanging\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical [[AC motor]]. Edison is increasingly marginalized and [[J. P. Morgan]] merges Edison Electric into [[General Electric]]. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. [[Samuel Insull]] presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The abundantly lit fair is revealed. Westinghouse was successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention ([[Thomas Edison#Motion pictures|Motion Pictures]]) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[George Westinghouse]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]]\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Marguerite Erskine Walker\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]]\n* [[Simon Manyonda]] as [[Lewis Latimer]]\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]]\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as [[Thomas Edison#Marriages and children|Mary Stilwell Edison]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/memorial/5814 |title=Mary Stilwell Edison (1855 - 1884)|publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[J.

Thanks to a clause in executive producer Martin Scorsese's contract, he had to approve all final cuts of the film, which resulted in Gomez-Rejon's being able to raise $1 million to complete post-production, as well as do one day of reshoots in England with Cumberbatch, Middleton and Hoult, rounding out their characters.<ref name=\"BIreshoots\">{{Cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-last-harvey-weinstein-movie-the-current-war-2019-10 |title= From Harvey Weinstein's 'bullying' demands to Martin Scorsese's last-minute rescue: Inside the resurrection of 'The Current War' |author= Jason Guerrasio |work= [[Business Insider]] |date= October 22, 2019 |accessdate= October 23, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released by [[The Weinstein Company]] on December 22, 2017,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/mary-magdalene-release-date-current-war-wind-river-premieres-1202046002/|title=\u2018Mary Magdalene\u2019, \u2018Current War\u2019 & \u2018Wind River\u2019 Get 2017 Release Dates From Weinstein|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=March 17, 2017|access-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref> and then rescheduled for November 24, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.angelikafilmcenter.com/nyc/film/the-current-war|title=The Current War|website=[[Angelika Film Center]]|access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref> It had its world premiere at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2017-lineup-announced-1024123|title=Toronto: Jennifer Lawrence's 'Mother!,' George Clooney's 'Suburbicon' Among 2017 Festival Lineup|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|date=July 25, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref> It was pulled from release following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse allegations]] that arose against [[Harvey Weinstein]], then co-head of the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/the-current-war-2018-release-date-change-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-1202185845/|title=Weinstein Co.

{"title_page": "History of Australia", "text_new": "{{short description|date=August 2014}}\n{{History of Australia}}\n{{Culture of Australia}}\n\nThe '''history of Australia''' Australia is the best country u ever heard of! is the history of the area and people of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] with its preceding [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] and colonial societies. [[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] in 1606. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, [[Torres Strait]] islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain and returned with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in Sydney), [[New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

Bowerman]]\n\nAfter the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half, named New South Wales, under the [[Administration (government)|administration]] of the colonial government in Sydney, and a western half named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory. ''An Historical Narrative of the Discovery of New Holland and New South Wales'', published in November 1786, contained \"A General Chart of New Holland, including New South Wales & Botany Bay, with The Adjacent Countries, and New Discovered Islands\", which showed all the territory claimed under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales.<ref>Robert J.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Despite the growing calls for unification, loyalties to the British Empire remained strong. At a Federation Conference banquet in 1890, Henry Parkes spoke of blood-kinship linking the colonies to Britain and a \"race\" for whom \"the purpose of settling new countries has never had its equal on the face of the earth\"<ref>Henry Parkes cited in D.M.

The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. Western Australia voted to join in July 1900. The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' was passed by the British parliament on 5 July 1900 and given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Queen Victoria]] on 9 July 1900.<ref>R.

From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. The first [[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the [[Protectionist Party]] over the [[Free Trade Party]] with the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) polling third.

As noted by the historian [[Ross McMullin]], \"In the national sphere Labor had taken the Protectionists as far in the direction of progressive legislation as possible.\" In New South Wales, Frank McDonnell dominated the agitation for the early closing of shops, which was achieved with the passage of the Factories and Shops Act of 1900, while also securing the extension of the grammar school scholarship system. In Western Australia, Forrest introduced a conciliation and arbitration bill in 1900 which brought trade unions into the state's social fabric for the first time. In addition, WA Labor scored another victory with the passage of legislation which extended workers' compensation.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close.

The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

Troubled by Britain's failure to increase defences at Singapore, Menzies was cautious in committing troops to Europe. By the end of June 1940, [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and the Low Countries had fallen to [[Nazi Germany]]. Britain stood alone with its [[dominion]]s. Menzies called for \"all-out war\", increasing federal powers and introducing conscription. Menzies' minority government came to rely on just two independents after the [[1940 Australian federal election|1940 election]].\n\nIn January 1941, Menzies flew to Britain to discuss the weakness of Singapore's defences. Arriving in London during [[The Blitz]], Menzies was invited into [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[United Kingdom coalition government (1940\u20131945)|British War Cabinet]] for the duration of his visit. Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek]] and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Unable to secure their support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as Prime Minister.

Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of General MacArthur, who became \"Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific\". Curtin had thus presided over a fundamental shift in Australia's foreign policy. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] in 1606. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, [[Torres Strait]] islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain and returned with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in Sydney), [[New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Gibb (1982) pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryParkes Melbourne.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Sir Henry Parkes delivering the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, 1 March 1890]]\n\nIn 1890, representatives of the six colonies and New Zealand had met in Melbourne and called for the union of the colonies and for the colonial legislatures to nominate representatives to attend a constitutional convention. The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. Western Australia voted to join in July 1900. The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' was passed by the British parliament on 5 July 1900 and given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Queen Victoria]] on 9 July 1900.<ref>R.

From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. The first [[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the [[Protectionist Party]] over the [[Free Trade Party]] with the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) polling third.

In Western Australia, Forrest introduced a conciliation and arbitration bill in 1900 which brought trade unions into the state's social fabric for the first time.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

Troubled by Britain's failure to increase defences at Singapore, Menzies was cautious in committing troops to Europe. By the end of June 1940, [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and the Low Countries had fallen to [[Nazi Germany]]. Britain stood alone with its [[dominion]]s. Menzies called for \"all-out war\", increasing federal powers and introducing conscription. Menzies' minority government came to rely on just two independents after the [[1940 Australian federal election|1940 election]].\n\nIn January 1941, Menzies flew to Britain to discuss the weakness of Singapore's defences. Arriving in London during [[The Blitz]], Menzies was invited into [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[United Kingdom coalition government (1940\u20131945)|British War Cabinet]] for the duration of his visit. Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek]] and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Unable to secure their support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as Prime Minister.

Churchill wanted them diverted to Burma, but Curtin refused, and anxiously awaited their return to Australia. US President [[Franklin D.

Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of General MacArthur, who became \"Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific\". Curtin had thus presided over a fundamental shift in Australia's foreign policy. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing.

The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 172\u201376</ref> Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians. Bernadotte moved West as ordered, pursued by Bennigsen where he ably defeated the numerically superior Russian vanguard at [[Battle of Mohrungen|Mohrungen]] (25 January 1807).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Due to the capture of a courier carrying the Emperor's latest orders, Bernadotte was not informed of a change of strategy to move East toward the rest of the French Army. As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing. Someday the Gascon will get caught.\"<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 135</ref> Subsequently, Bernadotte pursued, conjointly with Soult and [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] (known as the \"Pursuit of the Three Marshals\"), Prussian general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher's]] Corps to [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], where his troops stormed the Prussian defenses, taking the city<ref>Barton, D.

The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Europe]]. Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018; [[Athens]], the nation's capital, is its largest city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nSituated on the southern tip of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, [[North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, the [[Sea of Crete|Cretan Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[list of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring many [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}. The country consists of nine [[Geographic regions of Greece|traditional geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]].\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]], being the birthplace of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Western literature]], [[historiography]], [[political science]], major [[History of science in classical antiquity|scientific]] and [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] principles, [[Drama|Western drama]] and the [[Olympic Games]]. From the eighth century B.C., the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as ''poleis'' (singular ''[[polis]]''), which spanned the entire [[Mediterranean region]] and the [[Black Sea]]. [[Philip of Macedon]] united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC, with his son [[Alexander the Great]] rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. Greece was annexed by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in the second century B.C., becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], which adopted the Greek language and culture. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], which emerged in the first century A.D., helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox World]]. After falling under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern [[nation state]] in 1830 following a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]]. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\nGreece is a [[unitary parliamentary republic]] and [[developed country]] with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], a high [[quality of life]], and a very high [[Human Development Index|standard of living]]. Its economy is the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest]] in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

This is the source of the English alternate name ''Hellas'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u025b|l|\u0259|s}}), which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today. The Greek adjectival form {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''ellinikos'') is sometimes also translated as ''Hellenic'' and is often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official name of the Greek state, the ''Hellenic Republic'' ({{lang|el|\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}, pronounced {{IPA-el|elini\u02c8ci \u00f0imokra\u02c8ti.a|}}).

Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.\n\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the [[regions of ancient Greece|Hellenic lands]] under Ottoman rule. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|prolonged revolt in 1866\u20131869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.\n\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]].

The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]], is under planning.\n\nOther important projects that are currently underway, include the construction of the [[Thessaloniki Metro]].\n\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run [[Attiki Odos|A6 (Attiki Odos)]] motorway network and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system.\n\nMost of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]].\n\nRailway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/[[commuter rail]] connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around Athens, towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]; and around Patras.

Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.\n\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]]. The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Koine Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.\n\nThe [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]){{Sfn | Trudgill | 2000}} and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.\n\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece.

There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries. Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery.

There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 25\u201364 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is lower than the OECD average of 486.

Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]]. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]].\n\n[[Ancient Greek sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.<ref name=Gurewitsch>{{cite journal|last=Gurewitsch |first= Matthew |date=July 2008 |title= True Colors |journal= Smithsonian |pages= 66\u201371 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors.html}}</ref>\n\nThe art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \"abstract\", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. The [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] was the artistic expression of [[Macedonian Renaissance]], a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867\u20131056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.\n\nPost Byzantine art schools include the [[Cretan School]] and [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]. The first artistic movement in the [[Greek Kingdom]] can be considered the [[Greek academic art of the 19th century]] (''Munich School''). Notable modern Greek painters include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Theodoros Vryzakis]], [[Nikiforos Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]], [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] and [[Yannis Tsarouchis]], while some notable sculptors are [[Pavlos Prosalentis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Yannoulis Chalepas]].\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{See also|Ancient Greek architecture|Byzantine architecture|Modern Greek architecture}}\n[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Towerhouses of [[Mani peninsula]]]]\n\nThe architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (''Hellenes''), whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Aegean Islands]] and their [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]], for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods.\n\nByzantine architecture is the [[architecture]] promoted by the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]], dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] traditions that followed its collapse.\n\nAfter the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.<ref>\u03a0\u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03ae\u03c2, \u00ab\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2. \u039f \u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, \u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2\u00bb, \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf: \u03a3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc, \u03a0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4. \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 1976, \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb.158</ref>\n\nTwo special genres can be considered the [[Cycladic architecture]], featuring white-coloured houses, in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Epirotic architecture]] in the region of [[Epirus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travelaway.me/cycladic-architecture/|title=23 Best Examples of Cycladic Architecture|date=23 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greeka.com/epirus/architecture/|title=Architecture of Epirus, Greece - Greeka.com|website=Greekacom}}</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]].

The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed.

Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.\n\nOf the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.\n\n[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment ([[Diafotismos]]), writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] prepared with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821\u20131830).\n\nLeading figures of modern Greek literature include [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P.

The first philosophers are called \"Presocratics,\" which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.\n\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.\n\n[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy|accessdate= 23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].\n\nOn the eve of the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Gemistus Pletho]] tried to restore the use of the term \"Hellene\" and advocated the return to the [[Olympian Gods]] of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek Byzantine scholars]] who fled to western Europe contributed to the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, \"enlightenment\", \"illumination\") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].\n\nOther modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and [[Christos Yannaras]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Music of Greece}}\n[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cretan]] dancers of [[Greek folk music|traditional folk music]]]]\n[[File:Rembetes Karaiskaki 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rebetiko|Rebetes]] in Karaiskaki, [[Piraeus]] (1933). Left [[Markos Vamvakaris]] with [[bouzouki]].]]\n\nGreek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.\n\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.\n\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] (''Demotiko'') which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.\n\n[[File:Mikis2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Mikis Theodorakis]] is one of the most popular and significant Greek songwriters]]\n\nThe [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kant\u00e1dhes]] (\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870\u20131930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.\n\n[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[la\u00efk\u00f3]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].\n\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.\n\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include also [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|dictatorship of the Colonels]], the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a [[concentration camp]],<ref name=\"Hischak2015\">{{cite book|author=Thomas S.

Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick pur\u00e9e of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or ros\u00e9 wine sealed with pine resin) and [[Sesame seed candy|pasteli]] (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.\n\nSome sweet desserts include [[melomakarona]], [[diples]] and [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use \"sweet\" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s in stews.\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Greek cinema}}\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films began. ''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''\u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03bb\u03cc\u03b7''), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.

[[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.|Iraklis]] have also seen significant success in European competitions, having been three times runners-up of the [[CEV Champions League]].\n\nIn handball, [[AC Diomidis Argous]] is the only Greek club to have won a [[EHF Challenge Cup|European Cup]].\n\nApart from these, [[cricket]] is relatively popular in [[Corfu]].\n\n=== Mythology ===\n{{Main|Greek mythology}}\nThe numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.\n\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to his sister, [[Hera]]. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]], and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n[[File:Virgin Mary procession, Chora of Naxos, 118916.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Procession in honor of the Assumption of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (15 August)]]\n\nAccording to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non-school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''[[Greek Independence Day]]''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''[[Dormition of the Mother of God|Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin]]''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\" parallel to \"[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]\", or a \"Liberation Day\". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.\n\nNotable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|script-title=el:\u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03bb|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival \u2013 Profile|language=el|accessdate=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Greece|Ancient Greece}}\n* [[Outline of Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n* [[Index of Greece-related articles]]{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Main|Bibliography of Greece}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* \"Minorities in Greece&nbsp;\u2013 Historical Issues and New Perspectives\".

Europe]]. Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018; [[Athens]], the nation's capital, is its largest city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nSituated on the southern tip of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, [[North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, the [[Sea of Crete|Cretan Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[list of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring many [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}. The country consists of nine [[Geographic regions of Greece|traditional geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]].\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]], being the birthplace of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Western literature]], [[historiography]], [[political science]], major [[History of science in classical antiquity|scientific]] and [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] principles, [[Drama|Western drama]] and the [[Olympic Games]]. From the eighth century B.C., the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as ''poleis'' (singular ''[[polis]]''), which spanned the entire [[Mediterranean region]] and the [[Black Sea]]. [[Philip of Macedon]] united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC, with his son [[Alexander the Great]] rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. Greece was annexed by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in the second century B.C., becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], which adopted the Greek language and culture. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], which emerged in the first century A.D., helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox World]]. After falling under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern [[nation state]] in 1830 following a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]]. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\nGreece is a [[unitary parliamentary republic]] and [[developed country]] with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], a high [[quality of life]], and a very high [[Human Development Index|standard of living]]. Its economy is the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest]] in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

This is the source of the English alternate name ''Hellas'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u025b|l|\u0259|s}}), which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today.

Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.\n\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the [[regions of ancient Greece|Hellenic lands]] under Ottoman rule. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|prolonged revolt in 1866\u20131869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.\n\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]].

Under the junta, civil rights were suspended, political repression was intensified, and human rights abuses, including state-sanctioned torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on 17 November 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] and established brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as the new junta strongman.

The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]], is under planning.\n\nOther important projects that are currently underway, include the construction of the [[Thessaloniki Metro]].\n\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run [[Attiki Odos|A6 (Attiki Odos)]] motorway network and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system.\n\nMost of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]].\n\nRailway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/[[commuter rail]] connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around Athens, towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]; and around Patras. A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} network is underway.

Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.\n\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]]. The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Koine Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.\n\nThe [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]){{Sfn | Trudgill | 2000}} and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.\n\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece.

There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries. Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery.

There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 25\u201364 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is lower than the OECD average of 486.

Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]]. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]].\n\n[[Ancient Greek sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.<ref name=Gurewitsch>{{cite journal|last=Gurewitsch |first= Matthew |date=July 2008 |title= True Colors |journal= Smithsonian |pages= 66\u201371 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors.html}}</ref>\n\nThe art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \"abstract\", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. The [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] was the artistic expression of [[Macedonian Renaissance]], a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867\u20131056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.\n\nPost Byzantine art schools include the [[Cretan School]] and [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]. The first artistic movement in the [[Greek Kingdom]] can be considered the [[Greek academic art of the 19th century]] (''Munich School''). Notable modern Greek painters include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Theodoros Vryzakis]], [[Nikiforos Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]], [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] and [[Yannis Tsarouchis]], while some notable sculptors are [[Pavlos Prosalentis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Yannoulis Chalepas]].\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{See also|Ancient Greek architecture|Byzantine architecture|Modern Greek architecture}}\n[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Towerhouses of [[Mani peninsula]]]]\n\nThe architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (''Hellenes''), whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Aegean Islands]] and their [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]], for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods.\n\nByzantine architecture is the [[architecture]] promoted by the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]], dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] traditions that followed its collapse.\n\nAfter the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it.

Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.\n\nOf the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.\n\n[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment ([[Diafotismos]]), writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] prepared with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821\u20131830).\n\nLeading figures of modern Greek literature include [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P.

The first philosophers are called \"Presocratics,\" which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.\n\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.\n\n[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy|accessdate= 23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].\n\nOn the eve of the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Gemistus Pletho]] tried to restore the use of the term \"Hellene\" and advocated the return to the [[Olympian Gods]] of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek Byzantine scholars]] who fled to western Europe contributed to the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, \"enlightenment\", \"illumination\") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].\n\nOther modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and [[Christos Yannaras]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Music of Greece}}\n[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cretan]] dancers of [[Greek folk music|traditional folk music]]]]\n[[File:Rembetes Karaiskaki 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rebetiko|Rebetes]] in Karaiskaki, [[Piraeus]] (1933). Left [[Markos Vamvakaris]] with [[bouzouki]].]]\n\nGreek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.\n\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.\n\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] (''Demotiko'') which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.\n\n[[File:Mikis2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Mikis Theodorakis]] is one of the most popular and significant Greek songwriters]]\n\nThe [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kant\u00e1dhes]] (\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870\u20131930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.\n\n[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[la\u00efk\u00f3]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].\n\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.\n\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include also [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|dictatorship of the Colonels]], the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a [[concentration camp]],<ref name=\"Hischak2015\">{{cite book|author=Thomas S.

''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this.

[[Finos Film]] also contributed in this period with movies such as ''\u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1, \u03a6\u03c4\u03ce\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf'', ''[[Madalena (film)|Madalena]]'', ''[[I theia ap' to Chicago]]'', ''\u03a4\u03bf \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf \u03b2\u03b3\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf'' and many more.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThere are also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora, such as the Greek-French [[Costa-Gavras]] and the Greek-Americans [[Elia Kazan]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Alexander Payne]].\n\nMore recently [[Yorgos Lanthimos]] (film and stage director, producer, and screenwriter) has received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for his work, including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] for ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'' (2009), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''[[The Lobster]]'' (2015), and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''[[The Favourite]]'' (2018).\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sports in Greece}}\n[[File:Louis entering Kallimarmaron at the 1896 Athens Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Spyridon Louis]] entering the [[Panathenaic Stadium]] at the end of the marathon; [[1896 Summer Olympics]].]]\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Angelos Charisteas]] scoring Greece's winning goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final]]]]\n\nGreece is the birthplace of the [[ancient Olympic Games]], first recorded in 776 BC in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and hosted the modern [[Olympic Games]] twice, the inaugural [[1896 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.\n\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to his sister, [[Hera]]. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]], and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n[[File:Virgin Mary procession, Chora of Naxos, 118916.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Procession in honor of the Assumption of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (15 August)]]\n\nAccording to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non-school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''[[Greek Independence Day]]''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''[[Dormition of the Mother of God|Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin]]''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\" parallel to \"[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]\", or a \"Liberation Day\". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.\n\nNotable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|script-title=el:\u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03bb|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival \u2013 Profile|language=el|accessdate=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Greece|Ancient Greece}}\n* [[Outline of Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n* [[Index of Greece-related articles]]{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Main|Bibliography of Greece}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* \"Minorities in Greece&nbsp;\u2013 Historical Issues and New Perspectives\".
