Bristol Port owns both Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Docks. The '''Port of Bristol Authority''' was the commercial title of the Bristol City, Avonmouth, Portishead and Royal Portbury Docks when they were operated by [[Politics of Bristol|Bristol City Council]], which ceased trade when the Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Docks were leased to '''The Bristol Port Company''' in 1991.\n\n==History==\n{{For|more information on the history of the different dock complexes|Bristol Harbour|Avonmouth Docks|Portishead, Somerset|Royal Portbury Dock}}\n\nThe Port of Bristol grew up on the banks of the Rivers [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]], at their confluence upstream of the [[Avon Gorge]] which connects the city with the [[Bristol Channel]]. This part of the port was known as the Bristol City Docks, and is now more usually known as [[Bristol Harbour]]. The Avon and Frome are small, shallow rivers incapable in themselves of accommodating ocean-going ships, even those of the age of sail, as can still be seen by inspecting the branch of the Avon known as the [[New Cut (Bristol)|New Cut]] at low tide. The harbour depended on the extreme tides (14 metres) experienced in the Bristol Channel. Ships that wished to enter the harbour waited for the tide to begin to rise and floated up the river, through the [[Avon Gorge]], and into the harbour on the tide. Ships leaving the harbour set out at the high tide, and floated down to the sea with the ebbing tide. In the 1800s the harbour was enclosed by [[canal lock|locks]], together with a diversion of the River Avon, resulting in its alternative name of the ''Floating Harbour'', the Float, taken from the fact that the ships were able to float at all times, rather than resting in the mud at low tide, as had previously been the case.\n\nShipping Masters appointed under the [[Merchant Shipping Act]] included Henry Hellier Peters.<ref name=\"gazette 1862\">{{cite news | url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/22671/pages/4912/ | title=Notice of Adjudications and First Meeting of Creditors. | work=[[The London Gazette]] | date=14 October 1862 | accessdate=18 December 2012 | pages=4912}}</ref><ref name=\"MITCHELL1859\">{{cite book|author=WILLIAM MITCHELL|title=THE COMMERCIAL CODE OF SIGNALS FOR THE USE OF ALL NATIONS, WITH THE BRITISH VOCABULARY|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ukNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA8|accessdate=18 December 2012|year=1859|page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe navigation of the Avon Gorge always presented a challenge, and became more and more difficult as ships got larger.

A small splinter group, the  [[Pedro Le\u00f3n Arboleda Movement]], named after a deceased 1975 commander, had  been created in 1979.\n\nThe EPL declared a 1984 cease-fire together with several other guerrilla  groups that began and maintained negotiations with the government.

The main development work continued to be done by a small team at Sussex University until 1998, while marketing, sales, and support (except for UK academic users, who dealt directly with the Sussex team) was done by SDL and its successors. SDL, later named [SD], then [SD-Scion] then [http://www.eds.com EDS] (now [[Hewlett Packard]] Enterprise Services) marketed Poplog after EDS took over [[SD-Scicon]], until 1991.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/business/company-news-electronic-data-wins-in-offer-for-sd-scicon.html</ref> At that time a management buy-out produced a spin-off company Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), to sell and support Poplog in collaboration with Sussex University, who retained the rights to the name 'Poplog' and were responsible for the core software development while it was a commercial product. In 1992 ISL and Sussex University won a \"Smart Award\" in recognition of Poplog sales worth $5M.<ref>http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/jpg/smart-poplog-5million.jpg</ref>\nISL and its clients used Poplog for a number of development projects, especially ISL's data-mining system Clementine, mostly implemented in POP-11, using powerful graphical tools implemented also in POP-11 running on the [[X Window System]]. Clementine was so successful that in 1998 ISL was bought by [http://www.spss.com/ SPSS Inc] who had been selling the statistics and data-mining package [[SPSS]] for which they needed a better graphical interface suited to expert and non-expert users. SPSS did not wish to sell and support Poplog as such, so Poplog then became available as a free [[Open-source software|open source]] software package<ref>[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html The Free Poplog Portal]</ref>, hosted at the [[University of Birmingham]], which had also been involved in development after 1991. Later [[IBM]] bought SPSS and Clementine is now marketed and supported as [[SPSS Modeler]].<ref>[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/1999-AISBQ-TheStoryofClementine.pdf Khabaza, Tom. (1999). The Story of Clementine]</ref>\n\n==Supported languages==\nPoplog's core language is [[POP-11]]. It is used to implement the other languages, all of them [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]], with an integrated common editor. In the Linux/Unix versions, POP-11 provides support for 2-D graphics via [[X Window System|X]].\n\nPoplog supports incrementally compiled versions of [[Common Lisp]], [[POP-11]], [[Prolog]], and [[Standard ML]]. A separate package implemented by [[Robin Popplestone]] supports a version of [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].\n\nPoplog has been used both for academic research and teaching in artificial intelligence and also to develop several commercial products, apart from Clementine. In 1992, ISL and Sussex University won an ICP Million Dollar award in recognition of Poplog exceeding sales of US$5 million.<ref>[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/internal/bulletin/downloads/1990-1999/1992/May/19920520.pdf See page 3 of the May 20 1992 Sussex University Bulletin]</ref>\n\n==Platforms==\nPOP-11 was at first implemented on a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] computer in 1976, and was ported to [[VAX]]/[[OpenVMS|VMS]] in 1980. It became Poplog around 1982. Although the first commercial sales were for VAX/VMS, from the mid-1980s, the main Poplog development work was done on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] computers running [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], although several different versions were sold, including versions for [[HP-UX]] and a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] version of Poplog for [[DEC Alpha]] running [[Tru64 UNIX|Digital UNIX]]. After about 1999, when Poplog became available as free, open source, most development work was done on the Linux version, including porting to 64-bit Linux. A partial port to [[Mac OS X]] on [[PowerPC]] was done in 2005.\n\nThere is a version for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], originally developed to support Clementine, but the Unix/Linux graphical subsystem does not work on Windows Poplog. The Windows version of Clementine depended on a commercial package that supported [[X Window System|X]] functionality on Windows.\n\nThere is also an [[open source]] project<ref>[http://openpoplog.sourceforge.net/ OpenPoplog]</ref> which aimed to produce a more platform neutral version of Poplog, including Windows. The most recent development by this project includes a web server component for integrating into Poplog applications, and the OpenPoplog Widget Collection for supporting client user interfaces running in a web browser. A more narrowly focused open source Poplog project, restricted to the 64-bit AMD64/X86-68 architecture was set up on Github by Waldek Hebisch: [https://github.com/hebisch/poplog]. This is now the basis of Poplog Version 16 hosted at the University of Birmingham [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/V16/AREADME.html].\n\nAdditional information about the history and features of Poplog can be found in the entries for [[POP-2]] and [[POP-11]]. The chief architect of Poplog, responsible for many innovations related to making an incrementally compiled system portable, and providing support for a collection of languages was John Gibson, at Sussex University, though the earliest work was done by Steve Hardy. Chris Mellish helped with the initial Prolog implementation in POP-11. John Williams, working under supervision of Jonathan Cunningham implemented the Common Lisp subsystem. Robert Duncan and Simon Nichols added Standard ML. Between about 1980 and 1991, the project was managed by [[Aaron Sloman]], until he went to the [[University of Birmingham]], though he continued to collaborate with Sussex and ISL on Poplog development after that. Since 1999, he has been responsible for the main Poplog web site, as well as some of the extensions to be found there, listed under POP-11.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe Prolog subset of Poplog is implemented using the extendable [[incremental compiler]] of [[POP-11]], the core language of Poplog, which is a general purpose Lisp-like language with a more conventional syntax. The implementation required the Poplog Virtual Machine to be extended to provide support for Prolog [[continuation]]s, Prolog variables, the Prolog ''trail'' (recording undoable variable bindings), and Prolog terms.  The implementation was constrained by the need to allow data-structures to be shared with the other Poplog languages, especially [[POP-11]] and [[Common Lisp]], thereby providing support for a mixture of programming styles.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html The Free Poplog Portal]\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/eliza The online Poplog Eliza]\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/jpg/smart-poplog-5million.jpg Photo of ICP award Plaque]\n*Details also available here: [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/poplog-sussex-bulletin/] http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/poplog-sussex-bulletin]\n\n{{Common Lisp}}\n\n[[Category:Dynamic programming languages]]\n[[Category:Extensible syntax programming languages]]\n[[Category:History of computing in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Stack-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:University of Sussex]]\n", "text_old": "'''Poplog''' is an [[Open Source]], [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[dynamic compilation#Incremental compilation|incrementally compiled]] [[Computer programming|software development]] [[system platform|environment]] for the [[programming language]]s [[POP-11]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Prolog]], and [[Standard ML]], originally created in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for teaching and research in [[Artificial Intelligence]] at the [[University of Sussex]], and later marketed as a commercial package for software development as well as for teaching and research.

The user-accessible incremental-compiler tools that allow compilers for all these languages to be added also allow extensions to be made within a language to provide new powers that cannot be added using standard macros that merely allow new text to be equivalent to a longer portion of old text.\n\nFor some time after 1983, Poplog was sold and supported internationally as a commercial product, on behalf of the University of Sussex by Systems Designers Ltd (SDL), whose name changed as ownership changed. The main development work continued to be done by a small team at Sussex University until 1998, while marketing, sales, and support (except for UK academic users, who dealt directly with the Sussex team) was done by SDL and its successors. SDL, later named [SD], then [SD-Scion] then [http://www.eds.com EDS] (now [[Hewlett Packard]] Enterprise Services) marketed Poplog after EDS took over [[SD-Scicon]], until 1991.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/business/company-news-electronic-data-wins-in-offer-for-sd-scicon.html</ref> At that time a management buy-out produced a spin-off company Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), to sell and support Poplog in collaboration with Sussex University, who retained the rights to the name 'Poplog' and were responsible for the core software development while it was a commercial product. In 1992 ISL and Sussex University won a \"Smart Award\" in recognition of Poplog sales worth $5M<ref>http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/jpg/smart-poplog-5million.jpg</ref>.\nISL and its clients used Poplog for a number of development projects, especially ISL's data-mining system Clementine, mostly implemented in POP-11, using powerful graphical tools implemented also in POP-11 running on the [[X Window System]]. Clementine was so successful that in 1998 ISL was bought by [http://www.spss.com/ SPSS Inc] who had been selling the statistics and data-mining package [[SPSS]] for which they needed a better graphical interface suited to expert and non-expert users. SPSS did not wish to sell and support Poplog as such, so Poplog then became available as a free [[Open-source software|open source]] software package<ref>[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html The Free Poplog Portal]</ref>, hosted at the [[University of Birmingham]], which had also been involved in development after 1991. Later [[IBM]] bought SPSS and Clementine is now marketed and supported as [[SPSS Modeler]].<ref>[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/1999-AISBQ-TheStoryofClementine.pdf Khabaza, Tom. (1999). The Story of Clementine]</ref>\n\n==Supported languages==\nPoplog's core language is [[POP-11]]. It is used to implement the other languages, all of them [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]], with an integrated common editor. In the Linux/Unix versions, POP-11 provides support for 2-D graphics via [[X Window System|X]].\n\nPoplog supports incrementally compiled versions of [[Common Lisp]], [[POP-11]], [[Prolog]], and [[Standard ML]]. A separate package implemented by [[Robin Popplestone]] supports a version of [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].\n\nPoplog has been used both for academic research and teaching in artificial intelligence and also to develop several commercial products, apart from Clementine. In 1992, ISL and Sussex University won an ICP Million Dollar award in recognition of Poplog exceeding sales of US$5 million.<ref>[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/internal/bulletin/downloads/1990-1999/1992/May/19920520.pdf See page 3 of the May 20 1992 Sussex University Bulletin]</ref>\n\n==Platforms==\nPOP-11 was at first implemented on a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] computer in 1976, and was ported to [[VAX]]/[[OpenVMS|VMS]] in 1980. It became Poplog around 1982. Although the first commercial sales were for VAX/VMS, from the mid-1980s, the main Poplog development work was done on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] computers running [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], although several different versions were sold, including versions for [[HP-UX]] and a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] version of Poplog for [[DEC Alpha]] running [[Tru64 UNIX|Digital UNIX]]. After about 1999, when Poplog became available as free, open source, most development work was done on the Linux version, including porting to 64-bit Linux. A partial port to [[Mac OS X]] on [[PowerPC]] was done in 2005.\n\nThere is a version for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], originally developed to support Clementine, but the Unix/Linux graphical subsystem does not work on Windows Poplog. The Windows version of Clementine depended on a commercial package that supported [[X Window System|X]] functionality on Windows.\n\nThere is also an [[open source]] project<ref>[http://openpoplog.sourceforge.net/ OpenPoplog]</ref> which aimed to produce a more platform neutral version of Poplog, including Windows. The most recent development by this project includes a web server component for integrating into Poplog applications, and the OpenPoplog Widget Collection for supporting client user interfaces running in a web browser. A more narrowly focused open source Poplog project, restricted to the 64-bit AMD64/X86-68 architecture was set up on Github by Waldek Hebisch: [https://github.com/hebisch/poplog]. This is now the basis of Poplog Version 16 hosted at the University of Birmingham [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/V16/AREADME.html].\n\nAdditional information about the history and features of Poplog can be found in the entries for [[POP-2]] and [[POP-11]]. The chief architect of Poplog, responsible for many innovations related to making an incrementally compiled system portable, and providing support for a collection of languages was John Gibson, at Sussex University, though the earliest work was done by Steve Hardy. Chris Mellish helped with the initial Prolog implementation in POP-11. John Williams, working under supervision of Jonathan Cunningham implemented the Common Lisp subsystem. Robert Duncan and Simon Nichols added Standard ML. Between about 1980 and 1991, the project was managed by [[Aaron Sloman]], until he went to the [[University of Birmingham]], though he continued to collaborate with Sussex and ISL on Poplog development after that. Since 1999, he has been responsible for the main Poplog web site, as well as some of the extensions to be found there, listed under POP-11.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe Prolog subset of Poplog is implemented using the extendable [[incremental compiler]] of [[POP-11]], the core language of Poplog, which is a general purpose Lisp-like language with a more conventional syntax. The implementation required the Poplog Virtual Machine to be extended to provide support for Prolog [[continuation]]s, Prolog variables, the Prolog ''trail'' (recording undoable variable bindings), and Prolog terms.  The implementation was constrained by the need to allow data-structures to be shared with the other Poplog languages, especially [[POP-11]] and [[Common Lisp]], thereby providing support for a mixture of programming styles.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html The Free Poplog Portal]\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/eliza The online Poplog Eliza]\n*[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/jpg/smart-poplog-5million.jpg Photo of ICP award Plaque]\n*Details also available here: [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/poplog-sussex-bulletin/] http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/isl-docs/poplog-sussex-bulletin]\n\n{{Common Lisp}}\n\n[[Category:Dynamic programming languages]]\n[[Category:Extensible syntax programming languages]]\n[[Category:History of computing in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Stack-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:University of Sussex]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplog"}
