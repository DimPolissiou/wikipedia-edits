The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1\u20138 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\n\n[[File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg|alt=|thumb|upright=2.2|{{legend|#8cd19d|No standing army}} {{legend|#5cacc4|No current enforced conscription}} \n{{legend|#6600ff|Active draft system, but less than 20% of the whole age group are recruited}} {{legend|#fcb653|Plan to abolish conscription by the current government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2016/Nov-02/379319-ukraine-removes-last-conscripts-from-war-zone.ashx|title=Ukraine removes last conscripts from war zone}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201612120018.aspx|title=Military conscription to stop completely from 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-military-draft-/25131370.html|title=Kazakh Military Draft To End By 2016}}</ref>}}\n{{legend|#ff5254|Current ongoing conscription}} {{legend|#b9b9b9|No information}}]]\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as ''[[Siviilipalvelus]]'' (alternative civil service) in Finland, ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] like [[civil defence]].\n\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]]. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.<ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 }}</ref>\n\nVarious forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.<ref name=JN243>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 243] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 }}</ref>\n\n====Medieval levies====\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn medieval [[Scandinavia]] the ''lei\u00f0angr'' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), ''leidang'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''leding'', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''ledung'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''lichting'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''expeditio'' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes ''le\u00feing'' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.\n\nThe bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the ''[[fyrd]]'', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.<ref>Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52\n</ref> Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.\n\n====Military slavery====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[janissaries]]]]\n\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kap\u0131kulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kap\u0131kulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kap\u0131kulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeni\u00e7eri (Turkish military)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] }}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250 to 1517.\n\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163316/http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672\u20131727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}</ref>\n\n===In modern times===\n[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|left|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863 (by [[Aleksander Sochaczewski]]).]]\n{{see also|Remplacement}}\nModern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: \"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.\"  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6&nbsp;million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Conscription |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028164817/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/Conscription.html |archivedate=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]]. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Kr\u00fcmpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.<ref>Dierk Walter.

By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.\n\n====World Wars====\n[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription during [[World War I]], New York City, June 5, 1917.]]\n\nThe range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.\nIn the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].</ref> In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility. Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as \"call-up\" and extended to age 51. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (\"People's Storm\") and included children as young as 16 and men as old as 60.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date = February 1945|publisher=lonesentry.com }}</ref> During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women.

However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of ''[[Arver v. United States]]'' on 7 January 1918. The decision said the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] gave [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[declare war]] and to raise and support armies. The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:\n:\"It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.\"<ref>John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\n===Economic===\nIt can be argued that in a [[benefit\u2013cost ratio|cost-to-benefit ratio]], conscription during peacetime is not worthwhile.<ref>Henderson, David R. \"[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]\" (August 2005).</ref> Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.\n\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=Milton Friedman |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review|author-link=Milton Friedman }}</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\n\n===Political and moral motives===\n{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\n\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

The inhabitants of the demilitarized [[\u00c5land Islands]] are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of \u00c5land islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of \u00c5land islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.\n\nThe military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi (municipality)|Lapinj\u00e4rvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\nBetween 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German [[Bundeswehr|federal armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr''), as well as for the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] (German: ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') in the 1970s (see [[Compulsory Border Guard Service|Border Guard Service]]). With the end of the [[Cold War]] the [[Cabinet of Germany|German government]] drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ''Bundeswehr''.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{update section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb| [[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]\nSince 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1\u201310 days at irregular intervals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | title=Archived copy | accessdate=2012-04-10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | archivedate=2012-01-05 }}</ref>\n\nUniversal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\n\nThe period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12\u201336 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\n\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\n\n=== Israel ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}\nThere is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:\n* Muslim and Christian Arabs\n* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights\n* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption\n* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds. Many choose to volunteer in the national service [[Sherut Leumi]].\n\nAll of the above can choose to volunteer to the IDF.

Moldova's Defense Ministry announced that a plan which stipulates the gradual elimination of military conscription will be implemented starting from the autumn of 2018.<ref>http://www.moldova.org/en/moldova-defense-ministry-conscription-will-gradually-abolished-starting-autumn/</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n{{Unreferenced section | date=May 2015}}\n{{Main|Conscription in the Netherlands}}\nConscription, which was called \"Service Duty\" ({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the [[Netherlands]], was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. [[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\n\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\n\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country.

The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1\u20138 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\n\n[[File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg|alt=|thumb|upright=2.2|{{legend|#8cd19d|No standing army}} {{legend|#5cacc4|No current enforced conscription}} \n{{legend|#6600ff|Active draft system, but less than 20% of the whole age group are recruited}} {{legend|#fcb653|Plan to abolish conscription by the current government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2016/Nov-02/379319-ukraine-removes-last-conscripts-from-war-zone.ashx|title=Ukraine removes last conscripts from war zone}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201612120018.aspx|title=Military conscription to stop completely from 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-military-draft-/25131370.html|title=Kazakh Military Draft To End By 2016}}</ref>}}\n{{legend|#ff5254|Current ongoing conscription}} {{legend|#b9b9b9|No information}}]]\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as ''[[Siviilipalvelus]]'' (alternative civil service) in Finland, ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] like [[civil defence]].\n\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]]. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.<ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 }}</ref>\n\nVarious forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them.

These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.\n\n====Military slavery====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[janissaries]]]]\n\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kap\u0131kulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kap\u0131kulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kap\u0131kulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeni\u00e7eri (Turkish military)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] }}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250 to 1517.\n\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land.

The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France.

Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.\n\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=Milton Friedman |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review|author-link=Milton Friedman }}</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\n\n===Political and moral motives===\n{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\n\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

The inhabitants of the demilitarized [[\u00c5land Islands]] are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of \u00c5land islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of \u00c5land islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.\n\nThe military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi (municipality)|Lapinj\u00e4rvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\nBetween 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German [[Bundeswehr|federal armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr''), as well as for the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] (German: ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') in the 1970s (see [[Compulsory Border Guard Service|Border Guard Service]]). With the end of the [[Cold War]] the [[Cabinet of Germany|German government]] drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ''Bundeswehr''.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{update section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb| [[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]\nSince 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1\u201310 days at irregular intervals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | title=Archived copy | accessdate=2012-04-10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | archivedate=2012-01-05 }}</ref>\n\nUniversal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\n\nThe period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12\u201336 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\n\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\n\n=== Israel ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}\nThere is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:\n* Muslim and Christian Arabs\n* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights\n* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption\n* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds.

[[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\n\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\n\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force.

However, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a [[General Post Office]] telephonist, were told to continue working as before. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51.

The sculptor, Louis Paul Jonas, executed these prehistoric animals in fiberglass, after the designs of Barnum and Ostrom, for the Sinclair Refining Company's Pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1964.  After the Fair closed, the nine dinosaurs, which weighed between 2 and 4 tons each, were placed on trucks and taken on a tour of the eastern United States.

He was listed as 6' 4\" (1.93 m) and 215&nbsp;lbs, and was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]].\n\n==College career==\nLenard played [[college basketball]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].  After his junior season, he decided to test the waters of the [[NBA]], and declared himself eligible for the draft.  The [[Milwaukee Bucks]] selected Lenard in the second round of the [[1994 NBA Draft]].  Lenard subsequently opted instead to return to Minnesota to play out his senior season.  He finished his career with the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Golden Gophers]] as the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,103 points.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/bio.html |title=NBA.com: Voshon Lenard Bio<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209144401/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/bio.html |archive-date=2006-12-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nAfter graduating, Lenard went on to play in the minor-league [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA).  He averaged 30.1 points per game in 18 games for the [[Oklahoma City Cavalry]] during the 1995\u201396 season.<ref>1996-97 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 286</ref> He left in mid-season when he signed a contract with the [[Miami Heat]] of the NBA.\n\n===Miami Heat (1995\u20132000)===\nLenard played in 30 games for Miami to finish the 1996 season, averaging 5.9 points a game off the bench. The franchise had recently been rebuilt led by head coach [[Pat Riley]] and featured all-stars [[Alonzo Mourning]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and another shooting guard who would split minutes with Lenard, [[Dan Majerle]].\n\nLenard increased his scoring to 12.3 points a game in the 1996\u20131997 season, as he started in 47 of 73 games for a Heat team that posted its then best season in franchise history with 61 regular-season wins, and a playoff run that included a first ever trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. Lenard was particularly effective at shooting from beyond the three-point line, placing 7th in the league in three-point shots made and 10th in the league in three-point shooting percentage. The season also featured a memorable moment for Lenard and the Heat, when on December 11 in a road game against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] he scrambled for a loose ball rebound with 3 seconds left and the game tied, managing to launch and make a double-pump leaning shot to give Miami the big road win and one of the most memorable game winners in Miami Heat history. In the playoffs Lenard started in all 17 games for the Heat, averaging 11.4 points a game including a 24-point playoff debut against the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round and 19 points in the series clinching 5th game. Miami would face the [[New York Knicks]] in the semifinals, a series that would go to 7 games in which Lenard scored 22 points in game 3 and 21 in game 5. Miami would go on to lose in 5 games to the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]] in the East Finals.\n\nThe now proven and popular Lenard would then start in 81 games in the 1997\u20131998 season, averaging 12.6 points a game while continuing to shoot 40 percent from three-point range. The Heat would make the playoffs but would lose in the first round to New York in 5 games in the first round, with Lenard averaging 14.4 points during the series.  An injury would force Lenard to play in just 12 games in the lockout shortened 1998\u20131999 season, in which Miami again fell to the Knicks in the first round.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season Lenard played mostly off the bench, but averaged double-figure scoring with 11.9 points a game while shooting 39 percent from three-point range. Injuries would keep him out of the tail end of the season as well as the playoffs in which the Heat defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] before once again falling to New York in a seven-game series.  Following the season the Heat traded Lenard and [[Mark Strickland]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for [[Chris Gatling]].\n\n===Denver Nuggets (2000\u20132002)===\nIn his first season with the Nuggets, Lenard started in 58 of 80 regular-season games and averaged 12.2 points for a team that failed to make the playoffs, but he placed 10th in the league in total three-point field goals made. The following year featured lineup and rotation changes and he started in 19 of the 71 games he appeared in, but still averaged over 11 points a game. Following the season he signed with the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n===Toronto Raptors (2002-2003)===\nThe Raptors had made the playoffs for three straight seasons and featured superstar [[Vince Carter]], all-star [[Antonio Davis]] and coach [[Lenny Wilkens]]. Lenard started in 24 games of the 63 in which he appeared, but averaged 30 minutes a game, his most on the floor since the 1998 season.  As a result, he averaged a career-high 14.3 points a game and was second on the team in three-point field goals.  Despite this, Carter's injuries and other problems with the team led them to miss the playoffs, and Lenard returned to Denver in the off-season.\n\n===Return to Denver and the playoffs (2003\u20132006)===\nThe Nuggets had continued their playoff drought, but had managed to secure the 3rd pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] and selected college star and NCAA Champion [[Carmelo Anthony]]. The 2003\u20132004 season would then prove to be a personal best for Lenard, as he started in 70 games and averaged 14.2 points a game as the Nuggets, led by the play of Anthony, [[Andre Miller]] and [[Marcus Camby]], returned to the postseason. Lenard was also the winner of the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] [[Three-point Shootout]] which took place in Los Angeles, and would see his first postseason action since 1999, averaging a personal best 17 points a game in a five-game series loss against the top-seeded [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].\n\nThe Nuggets looked forward to the 2004\u20132005 season with optimism following the off-season acquisition of all-star forward [[Kenyon Martin]], but in the season opener against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] Lenard suffered an Achilles tendon injury that forced him out of nearly the entire season, only managing to play in two other games. Despite his limited mobility Lenard was able to participate in the 2005 three-point shootout during All-Star weekend, which was won by [[Quentin Richardson]].  Despite returning to action in the 2005\u20132006 season, Lenard suffered more injuries and was packaged to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in a four-team trade at the time of season trade deadline in February.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers (2006)===\nLenard would only play in 14 games to finish the season in Portland, and retired at the conclusion of 2006 season.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/index.html?nav=page NBA.com Official Profile]\n**{{basketball-reference}}\n\n{{Three-point Shootout Winners}}\n{{1994 NBA Draft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lenard, Voshon}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:African-American basketball players]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Canada]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Denver Nuggets players]]\n[[Category:Miami Heat players]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Bucks draft picks]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma City Cavalry players]]\n[[Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball)]]\n[[Category:Portland Trail Blazers players]]\n[[Category:Shooting guards]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Detroit]]\n[[Category:Toronto Raptors players]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox basketball biography\n| name            = Voshon Lenard\n| image           = \n| width           = \n| caption         = \n| number          = 22, 21, 5, 2, 1, 0\n| position        = [[Shooting guard]]\n| height_ft       = 6\n| height_in       = 4\n| weight_lb       = 205\n| birth_date      = {{birth date and age|1973|05|14}}\n| birth_place     = [[Detroit, Michigan]]\n| death_date      = \n| death_place     = \n| nationality     = American\n| high_school     = [[Southwestern High School (Michigan)|Southwestern]] (Detroit, Michigan)\n| college         = [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota]] (1991\u20131995)\n| draft_year      = 1994\n| draft_round     = 2\n| draft_pick      = 46\n| draft_team      = [[Milwaukee Bucks]]\n| career_start    = 1995\n| career_end      = 2006\n| years1          = 1995\u20131996\n| team1           = [[Oklahoma City Cavalry]]\n| years2          = {{nbay|1995|start}}\u2013{{nbay|1999|end}}\n| team2           = [[Miami Heat]]\n| years3          = {{nbay|2000|start}}\u2013{{nbay|2001|end}}\n| team3           = [[Denver Nuggets]]\n| years4          = {{nbay|2002|full=y}}\n| team4           = [[Toronto Raptors]]\n| years5          = {{nbay|2003|start}}\u2013{{nbay|2005|end}}\n| team5           = Denver Nuggets\n| years6          = {{nbay|2005|end}}\n| team6           = [[Portland Trail Blazers]]\n| highlights      =\n* [[NNBA Three-Point Contest]] champion ({{nasg|2004}})\n* Second-team [[Parade All-America Boys Basketball Team|''Parade'' All-American]] (1991)\n| stats_league    = NBA\n| stat1label      = [[Point (basketball)|Points]]\n| stat1value      = 6,745 (11.9 ppg)\n| stat2label      = [[Three-point field goal|3PFG]]\n| stat2value      = 936\n| stat3label      = [[Three-point field goal|3P%]]\n| stat3value      = .384\n| bbr             = lenarvo01\n}}\n'''Voshon Kelan Lenard''' (born May 14, 1973) is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player who played 11 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was listed as 6' 4\" (1.93 m) and 215&nbsp;lbs, and was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]].\n\n==College career==\nLenard played [[college basketball]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].  After his junior season, he decided to test the waters of the [[NBA]], and declared himself eligible for the draft.  The [[Milwaukee Bucks]] selected Lenard in the second round of the [[1994 NBA Draft]].  Lenard subsequently opted instead to return to Minnesota to play out his senior season.  He finished his career with the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Golden Gophers]] as the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,103 points.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/bio.html |title=NBA.com: Voshon Lenard Bio<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209144401/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/bio.html |archive-date=2006-12-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nAfter graduating, Lenard went on to play in the minor-league [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA).  He averaged 30.1 points per game in 18 games for the [[Oklahoma City Cavalry]] during the 1995\u201396 season.<ref>1996-97 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 286</ref> He left in mid-season when he signed a contract with the [[Miami Heat]] of the NBA.\n\n===Miami Heat (1995\u20132000)===\nLenard played in 30 games for Miami to finish the 1996 season, averaging 5.9 points a game off the bench. The franchise had recently been rebuilt led by head coach [[Pat Riley]] and featured all-stars [[Alonzo Mourning]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and another shooting guard who would split minutes with Lenard, [[Dan Majerle]].\n\nLenard increased his scoring to 12.3 points a game in the 1996\u20131997 season, as he started in 47 of 73 games for a Heat team that posted its then best season in franchise history with 61 regular-season wins, and a playoff run that included a first ever trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. Lenard was particularly effective at shooting from beyond the three-point line, placing 7th in the league in three-point shots made and 10th in the league in three-point shooting percentage. The season also featured a memorable moment for Lenard and the Heat, when on December 11 in a road game against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] he scrambled for a loose ball rebound with 3 seconds left and the game tied, managing to launch and make a double-pump leaning shot to give Miami the big road win and one of the most memorable game winners in Miami Heat history. In the playoffs Lenard started in all 17 games for the Heat, averaging 11.4 points a game including a 24-point playoff debut against the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round and 19 points in the series clinching 5th game. Miami would face the [[New York Knicks]] in the semifinals, a series that would go to 7 games in which Lenard scored 22 points in game 3 and 21 in game 5. Miami would go on to lose in 5 games to the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]] in the East Finals.\n\nThe now proven and popular Lenard would then start in 81 games in the 1997\u20131998 season, averaging 12.6 points a game while continuing to shoot 40 percent from three-point range. The Heat would make the playoffs but would lose in the first round to New York in 5 games in the first round, with Lenard averaging 14.4 points during the series.  An injury would force Lenard to play in just 12 games in the lockout shortened 1998\u20131999 season, in which Miami again fell to the Knicks in the first round.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season Lenard played mostly off the bench, but averaged double-figure scoring with 11.9 points a game while shooting 39 percent from three-point range. Injuries would keep him out of the tail end of the season as well as the playoffs in which the Heat defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] before once again falling to New York in a seven-game series.  Following the season the Heat traded Lenard and [[Mark Strickland]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for [[Chris Gatling]].\n\n===Denver Nuggets (2000\u20132002)===\nIn his first season with the Nuggets, Lenard started in 58 of 80 regular-season games and averaged 12.2 points for a team that failed to make the playoffs, but he placed 10th in the league in total three-point field goals made. The following year featured lineup and rotation changes and he started in 19 of the 71 games he appeared in, but still averaged over 11 points a game. Following the season he signed with the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n===Toronto Raptors (2002-2003)===\nThe Raptors had made the playoffs for three straight seasons and featured superstar [[Vince Carter]], all-star [[Antonio Davis]] and coach [[Lenny Wilkens]]. Lenard started in 24 games of the 63 in which he appeared, but averaged 30 minutes a game, his most on the floor since the 1998 season.  As a result, he averaged a career-high 14.3 points a game and was second on the team in three-point field goals.  Despite this, Carter's injuries and other problems with the team led them to miss the playoffs, and Lenard returned to Denver in the off-season.\n\n===Return to Denver and the playoffs (2003\u20132006)===\nThe Nuggets had continued their playoff drought, but had managed to secure the 3rd pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] and selected college star and NCAA Champion [[Carmelo Anthony]]. The 2003\u20132004 season would then prove to be a personal best for Lenard, as he started in 70 games and averaged 14.2 points a game as the Nuggets, led by the play of Anthony, [[Andre Miller]] and [[Marcus Camby]], returned to the postseason. Lenard was also the winner of the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] [[Three-point Shootout]] which took place in Los Angeles, and would see his first postseason action since 1999, averaging a personal best 17 points a game in a five-game series loss against the top-seeded [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].\n\nThe Nuggets looked forward to the 2004\u20132005 season with optimism following the off-season acquisition of all-star forward [[Kenyon Martin]], but in the season opener against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] Lenard suffered an Achilles tendon injury that forced him out of nearly the entire season, only managing to play in two other games. Despite his limited mobility Lenard was able to participate in the 2005 three-point shootout during All-Star weekend, which was won by [[Quentin Richardson]].  Despite returning to action in the 2005\u20132006 season, Lenard suffered more injuries and was packaged to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in a four-team trade at the time of season trade deadline in February.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers (2006)===\nLenard would only play in 14 games to finish the season in Portland, and retired at the conclusion of 2006 season.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/voshon_lenard/index.html?nav=page NBA.com Official Profile]\n**{{basketball-reference}}\n\n{{Three-point Shootout Winners}}\n{{1994 NBA Draft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lenard, Voshon}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:African-American basketball players]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Canada]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Denver Nuggets players]]\n[[Category:Miami Heat players]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Bucks draft picks]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma City Cavalry players]]\n[[Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball)]]\n[[Category:Portland Trail Blazers players]]\n[[Category:Shooting guards]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Detroit]]\n[[Category:Toronto Raptors players]]\n", "name_user": "Bagumba", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voshon_Lenard"}

It is often seen in aquatic [[vertebrates]], especially those living in shallow waters,<ref name=\"Houssaye 2009\">Houssaye, A. (2009). \"Pachyostosis\" in aquatic amniotes: a review. Integrative Zoology 4(4): 325-340.</ref> providing [[ballast]] as an adaptation for an aquatic lifestyle. It makes bones heavier, but also more fragile. In those animal groups, osteosclerosis often occurs together with bone thickening ([[pachyostosis]]).

By assuming that title, the sovereign of [[Moscow]] tried to emphasize that he was a major ruler or [[emperor]] (''tsar'' ({{lang-ru | \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c}}) represents the Slavic adaptation of the Roman Imperial title/name [[Caesar (title) | ''Caesar'']]<ref>\n {{OEtymD| tsar | accessdate= 2019-06-13}}\n</ref>) on a par with the [[List of Byzantine emperors| Byzantine emperor]] or with the Mongol [[Khan (title) |khan]]. Indeed, after [[Ivan III of Russia |Ivan III]] married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the late Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], in 1472, the Moscow court adopted [[Byzantine Empire| Byzantine]] terms, rituals, titles, and emblems such as the [[double-headed eagle]], which survives in the [[Coat of Arms of Russia]].\n\nAt first, the Byzantine term ''[[autokrator]]'' expressed only the literal meaning of an independent ruler, but in the reign of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (1533-1584) it came to imply unlimited ([[autocratic]]) rule. In 1547 the Grand Duke Ivan IV was crowned Tsar and thus was recognized - at least by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] - as Emperor. Notably, the hegumen [[Philotheus of Pskov]] claimed in 1510 that after [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the Russian Tsar remained the only legitimate Orthodox ruler, and that [[Moscow, third Rome|Moscow was the Third Rome]], becoming the final lineal successor to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and[[Byzantine Empire| Constantinople]], the two centers of [[Christianity]] and of the Roman Empires ([[Western Roman Empire |Western]] and[[Eastern Roman Empire | Eastern]]) of earlier periods. The [[Third Rome concept|\"Third Rome\" concept]] would resonate in the self-image of the Russian people in future centuries.\n\n==Early reign of Ivan IV==\nThe development of the Tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign of Ivan IV, and he gained the sobriquet \"Grozny\". The English word ''terrible'' is usually used to translate the Russian word ''grozny'' in Ivan's nickname, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word ''grozny'' reflects the older English usage of ''terrible'' as in \"inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable\". It does not convey the more modern connotations of English ''terrible'', such as \"defective\" or \"evil\". [[Vladimir Dal]] defined ''grozny'' specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: \"Courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience\".<ref>Dal, Vladimir, [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]], article ''\u0413\u0420\u041e\u0417\u0418\u0422\u042c''.

The [[Shuysky]] and [[Belsky family (Gediminid)|Belsky]] factions of the [[boyar]]s competed for control of the regency until Ivan assumed the throne in 1547. Reflecting Moscow's new imperial claims, Ivan's coronation as Tsar was a ritual modeled after those of the Byzantine emperors. With the continuing assistance of a group of boyars, Ivan began his reign with a series of useful reforms. In the 1550s, he declared a new law code, revamped the military, and reorganized local government. These reforms undoubtedly were intended to strengthen the state in the face of continuous warfare. The key documents prepared by the so-called [[Izbrannaya Rada|Select Council]] of advisors and promulgated during this period are as follows:\n\n{{Muscovite Constitution}}\n\n==Foreign policies of Ivan IV==\n{{Main|Muscovite\u2013Lithuanian Wars|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Clocher d'Ivan le Grand.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], raised to the present height during the reign of [[Boris Godunov]]]]\n\n[[Muscovy (Grand Duchy)]] remained a fairly unknown society in Western Europe until Baron [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] published his [[Notes on Muscovite Affairs|Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]] (literally ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs'') in 1549. This provided a broad view of what had been a rarely visited and poorly reported state. In the 1630s, the Russian Tsardom was visited by [[Adam Olearius]], whose lively and well-informed writings were soon translated into all the major languages of [[Europe]].\n\nFurther information about Russia was circulated by English and Dutch [[merchant]]s. One of them, [[Richard Chancellor]], sailed to the [[White Sea]] in 1553 and continued overland to Moscow. Upon his return to England, the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by himself, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]], and several London merchants. Ivan IV used these merchants to exchange letters with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nDespite the domestic turmoil of the 1530s and 1540s, Russia continued to wage wars and to expand. It grew from 2.8 to 5.4 million square kilometers from 1533 to 1584.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, p. 80</ref> Ivan [[Russo-Kazan Wars|defeated and annexed]] the [[Khanate of Kazan]] on the middle [[Volga River|Volga]] in 1552 and later the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], where the Volga meets the [[Caspian Sea]]. These victories transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state, which it continues to be today. The tsar now controlled the entire Volga River and gained access to Central Asia.\n\nExpanding to the northwest toward the [[Baltic Sea]] proved to be much more difficult. In 1558, Ivan invaded [[Livonia]], eventually involving himself in a [[Livonian War|twenty-five-year war]] against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]. Despite occasional successes, Ivan's army was pushed back, and the nation failed to secure a coveted position on the Baltic Sea.\n\nHoping to make profit from Russia's concentration on Livonian affairs, [[Devlet I Giray]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], accompanied by as many as 120,000 horsemen, [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|repeatedly devastated the Moscow region]], until the [[Battle of Molodi]] put a stop to such northward incursions. But for decades to come, the southern borderland was annually pillaged by the [[Nogai Horde]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]], who took local inhabitants with them as slaves. Tens of thousands of soldiers protected the [[Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Belt]] \u2014 a burden for a state whose social and economic development was stagnating.\n\n==Oprichnina==\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n[[File:Apostol 1564 Frontispis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Apostle'' (1564) by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], one of the first Russian printed books]]\n\nDuring the late 1550s, Ivan developed a hostility toward his advisers, the government, and the [[boyar]]s. Historians have not determined whether policy differences, personal animosities, or mental imbalance caused his wrath. In 1565, he divided Russia into two parts: his private domain (or [[oprichnina]]) and the public realm (or [[zemshchina]]). For his private domain, Ivan chose some of the most prosperous and important districts of Russia. In these areas, Ivan's agents attacked boyars, merchants, and even common people, summarily executing some and confiscating land and possessions. Thus began a decade of terror in Russia that culminated in the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] (1570).\n\nAs a result of the policies of the ''oprichnina'', Ivan broke the economic and political power of the leading [[boyar]] families, thereby destroying precisely those persons who had built up Russia and were the most capable of administering it. Trade diminished, and peasants, faced with mounting taxes and threats of violence, began to leave Russia. [[George's Day in Autumn|Efforts to curtail the mobility of the peasants]] by tying them to their land brought Russia closer to legal [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]]. In 1572, Ivan finally abandoned the practices of the oprichnina.\n\nAccording to a popular theory,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{by whom|date=October 2015}} the oprichnina was started by Ivan in order to mobilize resources for the wars and to quell opposition. Regardless of the reason, Ivan's domestic and foreign policies had a devastating effect on Russia and led to a period of social struggle and civil war, the [[Time of Troubles]] (''Smutnoye vremya'', 1598-1613).\n\n==Time of Troubles==\n{{Main|Time of Troubles|Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)}}\nIvan IV was succeeded by his son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]], who was mentally deficient. Actual power went to Feodor's brother-in-law, the boyar [[Boris Godunov]] (who is credited with abolishing [[George's Day in Autumn|Yuri's Day]], the only time of the year when serfs were free to move from one landowner to another). Perhaps the most important event of Feodor's reign was the proclamation of the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1589. The creation of the patriarchate climaxed the evolution of a separate and totally independent [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn 1598, Feodor died without an heir, ending the [[Rurik]] Dynasty. Boris Godunov then convened a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'', a national assembly of boyars, church officials, and commoners, which proclaimed him tsar, although various boyar factions refused to recognize the decision. Widespread crop failures caused the [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]], and during the ensuing discontent, a man emerged who claimed to be [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Demetrius]], Ivan IV's son who had died in 1591. This pretender to the throne, who came to be known as [[False Dmitriy I]], gained support in Poland and marched to Moscow, gathering followers among the boyars and other elements as he went. Historians speculate<ref>[[Ruslan Skrynnikov]]. ''Boris Godunov''. Moscow: Nauka, 1983. Reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|5-17-010892-3}}.</ref> that Godunov would have weathered this crisis had he not died in 1605. As a result, False Dmitriy I entered Moscow and was crowned tsar that year, following the murder of Tsar [[Feodor II of Russia|Feodor II]], Godunov's son.\n\nSubsequently, Russia entered a period of continuous chaos, known as ''The [[Time of Troubles]]'' (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f). Despite the Tsar's persecution of the boyars, the townspeople's dissatisfaction, and the gradual enserfment of the peasantry, efforts at restricting the power of the Tsar were only halfhearted. Finding no institutional alternative to the autocracy, discontented Russians rallied behind various pretenders to the throne. During that period, the goal of political activity was to gain influence over the sitting autocrat or to place one's own candidate on the throne. The boyars fought among themselves, the lower classes revolted blindly, and foreign armies occupied [[the Kremlin]] in Moscow, prompting many to accept [[Tsarist autocracy]] as a necessary means to restoring order and unity in Russia.\n\n[[File:Lissner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Poles]] surrender the [[Moscow Kremlin]] to [[Prince Pozharsky]] in 1612. Painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]\nThe Time of Troubles included a civil war in which a struggle over the throne was complicated by the machinations of rival boyar factions, the intervention of regional powers Poland and Sweden, and intense popular discontent, led by [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]. False Dmitriy I and his Polish garrison were overthrown, and a boyar, [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]], was proclaimed tsar in 1606. In his attempt to retain the throne, Shuysky allied himself with the Swedes, unleashing the [[Ingrian War]] with Sweden. [[False Dmitry II]], allied with the Poles, appeared under the walls of Moscow and set up a mock court in the village of [[Tushino]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Poland intervened into Russian affairs officially]], captured Shuisky, and occupied the Kremlin. A group of Russian boyars signed in 1610 a treaty of peace, recognising [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|Ladislaus IV of Poland]], son of Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], as tsar. In 1611, [[False Dmitry III]] appeared in the Swedish-occupied territories, but was soon apprehended and executed. The Polish presence led to a patriotic revival among the Russians, and a volunteer army, financed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchants and blessed by the Orthodox Church, was formed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and, led by Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]], drove the Poles out of the Kremlin. In 1613, a [[zemsky Sobor]] proclaimed the boyar [[Michael of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]] as tsar, beginning the 300-year reign of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family.\n\n==Romanovs==\n[[File:Tsar boyar duma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Andrei Ryabushkin]]: ''Tsar Michael at the Session of the [[Boyar Duma]]'' (1893)]]\nThe immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore order. However, Russia's major enemies, Poland and Sweden, were engaged in a conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617. The [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)]] was ended with the [[Truce of Deulino]] in 1618, restoring temporarily Polish and Lithuanian rule over some territories, including [[Smolensk]], lost by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1509.\n\nThe early [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were weak rulers. Under Mikhail, state affairs were in the hands of the tsar's father, [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Filaret]], who in 1619 became Patriarch of Moscow. Later, Mikhail's son [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey]] (r. 1645-1676) relied on a boyar, [[Boris Morozov]], to run his government. Morozov abused his position by exploiting the populace, and in 1648 Aleksey dismissed him in the wake of the [[Salt Riot]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter [[Smolensk War|an unsuccessful attempt to regain Smolensk]] from Poland in 1632, Russia made peace with Poland in 1634. Polish king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], whose father and predecessor was [[Sigismund III Vasa]], had been elected by Russian boyars as tsar of Russia during the Time of Troubles, renounced all claims to the title as a condition of the peace treaty.\n\n==Legal code of 1649==\nThe [[autocracy]] survived the [[Time of Troubles]] and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central [[bureaucracy]]. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the ruler's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] or the [[boyar]] faction controlling the throne. In the 17th century, the bureaucracy expanded dramatically. The number of government departments (''prikazy'' ; sing., ''[[prikaz]]'' ) increased from twenty-two in 1613 to eighty by mid-century. Although the departments often had overlapping and conflicting [[jurisdiction]]s, the central government, through [[province|provincial]] governors, was able to control and regulate all social groups, as well as trade, manufacturing, and even the [[Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Godfrey Kneller - Portrait of P.Potemkin (1682, Hermitage) - contrast.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Russian diplomat and [[voivode]] [[Pyotr Potemkin]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nThe [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye]], a comprehensive [[legal code]] introduced in 1649, illustrates the extent of state control over [[Russia]]n society. By that time, the boyars had largely merged with the new elite, who were obligatory servitors of the state, to form a new [[nobility]], the [[dvoryanstvo]]. The state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military because of permanent warfare on southern and western borders and attacks of [[nomad]]s. In return, the nobility received land and [[peasant]]s. In the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one [[landlord]] to another; the 1649 code officially attached peasants to their [[home]].\n\nThe state fully sanctioned [[serfdom]], and runaway peasants became state [[fugitive]]s. Landlords had complete power over their peasants<!--and bought, sold, traded, and [[mortgage]]d them-->. Peasants living on state-owned land, however, were not considered serfs. They were organized into [[commune]]s, which were responsible for taxes and other obligations. Like serfs, however, state peasants were attached to the land they farmed. Middle-class urban [[tradesmen]] and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes. By chaining much of Russian society to specific domiciles, the legal code of 1649 curtailed movement and subordinated the people to the interests of the state.\n\nUnder this code, increased state taxes and regulations altered the social discontent that had been simmering since the Time of Troubles. In the 1650s and 1660s, the number of peasant escapes increased dramatically. A favourite refuge was the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] region, domain of the [[Don Cossacks]]. A major uprising occurred in the [[Volga]] region in 1670 and 1671. [[Stenka Razin]], a Cossack who was from the Don River region, led a revolt that drew together wealthy Cossacks who were well established in the region and escaped serfs seeking free land. The unexpected uprising swept up the Volga River valley and even threatened Moscow. Tsarist troops finally defeated the rebels after they had occupied major cities along the Volga in an operation whose panache captured the imaginations of later generations of Russians. Razin was publicly tortured and executed.\n\n==Acquisition of Ukrainian lands==\n[[File:Russian clothes Soln.jpeg|thumb|A warrior of the Russian noble cavalry (''\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430'') during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War of 1654\u20131667]]. The drawing is based on the pieces preserved in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].]]\n\nThe Tsardom of Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century. In the southwest, it claimed eastern [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] lands, which had been under [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] rule and sought assistance from the Tsardom to leave the rule of the Commonwealth. The [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], warriors organized in military formations, lived in the frontier areas bordering Poland, the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] lands. Although part of them was serving in the Polish army as [[Registered Cossacks]], the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] remained fiercely independent and staged several rebellions against the Poles. In 1648, the peasants of what is now Ukraine joined the Cossacks in rebellion during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. Initially, Cossacks were allied with [[Crimean Tatars]], which had helped them to throw off Polish rule. Once the Poles convinced the Tartars to switch sides, the Zaporozhian Cossacks needed military help to maintain their position.\n\nIn 1648, the  [[Hetman]] (leader) of the [[Zaporozhian host|Zaporozhian Host]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to ally with the Russian [[tsar]], [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer, which was ratified in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654, led to [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|a protracted war between Poland and Russia]]. The [[Truce of Andrusovo]], which did not involve the Hetmanate ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]) as a participating party of the agreement ended the war in 1667. Cossacks considered it as a Moscow betrayal. As a result, it split Ukrainian territory along the [[Dnieper River]], reuniting the western sector (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) with Poland and leaving the eastern sector ([[Left-bank Ukraine]]) self-governing under the sovereignty of the tsar. However, the self-government did not last long and Eastern Ukrainian territory was eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire (after the [[Battle of Poltava]]) during the 18th century.\n\n==Raskol (Schism)==\n{{Main|Raskol}}\n[[File:PhilipandNikon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Patriarch Nikon]] and Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] in the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]]]]\n\nRussia's southwestern expansion, particularly its incorporation of eastern Ukraine, had [[unintended consequence]]s. Most Ukrainians were Orthodox, but their close contact with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Polish also brought them Western intellectual currents. Through the Ukrainian [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Academy in Kiev]], Russia gained links to Polish and Central European influences and to the wider Orthodox world. Although the Ukrainian link induced creativity in many areas, it also weakened traditional Russian religious practices and culture. The Russian Orthodox Church discovered that its isolation from [[Constantinople]] had caused variations to appear between their [[liturgical book]]s and practices.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox patriarch, [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], was determined to bring the Russian texts back into conformity with the [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and practices of the time. But Nikon encountered opposition among the many Russians who viewed the corrections as improper foreign intrusions. When the Orthodox Church forced Nikon's reforms, a schism resulted in 1667. Those who did not accept the reforms came to be called the [[Old Believers]]; they were officially pronounced heretics and were persecuted by the church and the state. The chief opposition figure, the protopope [[Avvakum]], was burned at the stake. The split afterwards became permanent, and many merchants and peasants joined the Old Believers.\n\nThe tsar's court also felt the impact of Ukraine and the West. Kiev was a major transmitter of new ideas and insight through the famed scholarly [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|academy]] that [[Peter Mogila|Metropolitan Mohyla]] founded there in 1631. Other more direct channels to the West opened as international trade increased and more foreigners came to Russia. The Tsar's court was interested in the West's more advanced technology, particularly when military applications were involved. By the end of the 17th century, Ukrainian, Polish, and West European penetration had weakened the Russian cultural synthesis\u2014at least among the elite\u2014and had prepared the way for an even more radical transformation.\n\n==Conquest of Siberia==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n[[File:Surikov Pokoreniye Sibiri Yermakom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Vasily Surikov]]: ''Yermak's Conquest of Siberia'' (1895)]]\nRussia's eastward expansion encountered little resistance. In 1581, the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchant family, interested in the fur trade, hired a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] leader, [[Yermak Timofeyevich]], to lead an expedition into western [[Siberia]]. Yermak defeated the [[Khanate of Sibir]] and claimed the territories west of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh]] Rivers for Russia.\n\nFrom such bases as [[Mangazeya]], merchants, traders, and explorers pushed eastward from the [[Ob River]] to the [[Yenisei River]], then on to the [[Lena River]] and the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Cossack [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the passage between America and Asia. By the middle of the 17th century, Russians had reached the [[Amur River]] and the outskirts of the [[Late Imperial China|Chinese Empire]].\n\nAfter a period of conflict with the [[Qing dynasty]], Russia made peace with [[China]] in 1689. By the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], Russia ceded its claims to the Amur Valley, but it gained access to the region east of [[Lake Baikal]] and the trade route to [[Beijing]]. Peace with China strengthened the initial breakthrough to the Pacific that had been made in the middle of the century.\n\n==Reign of Peter the Great and establishment of the Russian Empire==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Main|Peter the Great|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity Church at Putinki]], an example of the 17th-century Russian [[uzorochye]] style]]\n\n[[Peter the Great]] (1672\u20131725), who became ruler in his own right in 1696, was destined to bring the Tsardom of Russia, which had little contact with Europe and was mostly seen as a regional power, into the mainstream of European culture and politics. After suppressing numerous rebellions with considerable bloodshed, Peter embarked on [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|a tour of Western Europe incognito]]. He became impressed with what he saw and was awakened to the backwardness of Russia. Peter began requiring the nobility to wear Western clothing and shave off their beards, an action that the [[boyar]]s protested bitterly. Arranged marriages among nobility were banned and the Orthodox Church brought under state control. Military academies were established to create a modern European-style army and officer corps in place of the disorganized levies that Muscovite rulers had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes did not win Peter many friends and in fact caused great political division in the country. These along with his notorious cruelties (such as the torture death of [[Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|his own son]] for plotting a rebellion) and the immense human suffering that accompanied many of his projects such as the construction of [[Saint Petersburg]] led many pious Russians to believe that he was the [[Antichrist]]. The [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]] consumed much of Peter's attention for years, however the Swedes were eventually defeated and peace agreed to in 1721. Russia annexed the Baltic coast from Sweden and parts of [[Finland]], which would become the site of the new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. The Russian victory in the Great Northern War marked a watershed in European politics, as it not only brought about the eclipse of Sweden and Poland as great powers, but also Russia's decisive emergence as a permanent factor in Europe. Expansion into Siberia also continued and [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u201323)|war]] with [[Persia]] brought about the acquisition of territory in the [[Caucasus]], although Russia surrendered those gains after Peter's death in 1725.\n\n==State flags==\nThere was no single flag during the Tsardom.

By assuming that title, the sovereign of [[Moscow]] tried to emphasize that he was a major ruler or [[emperor]] (''tsar'' ({{lang-ru | \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c}}) represents the Slavic adaptation of the Roman Imperial title/name [[Caesar (title) | ''Caesar'']]<ref>\n {{OEtymD| tsar | accessdate= 2019-06-13}}\n</ref>) on a par with the [[List of Byzantine emperors| Byzantine emperor]] or with the Mongol [[Khan (title) |khan]]. Indeed, after [[Ivan III of Russia |Ivan III]] married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the late Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], in 1472, the Moscow court adopted [[Byzantine Empire| Byzantine]] terms, rituals, titles, and emblems such as the [[double-headed eagle]], which survives in the [[Coat of Arms of Russia]].\n\nAt first, the Byzantine term ''[[autokrator]]'' expressed only the literal meaning of an independent ruler, but in the reign of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (1533-1584) it came to imply unlimited ([[autocratic]]) rule. In 1547 the Grand Duke Ivan IV was crowned Tsar and thus was recognized - at least by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] - as Emperor. Notably, the hegumen [[Philotheus of Pskov]] claimed in 1510 that after [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the Russian Tsar remained the only legitimate Orthodox ruler, and that [[Moscow, third Rome|Moscow was the Third Rome]], becoming the final lineal successor to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire| Constantinople]], the two centers of [[Christianity]] and of the Roman Empires ([[Western Roman Empire |Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire | Eastern]]) of earlier periods. The [[Third Rome concept|\"Third Rome\" concept]] would resonate in the self-image of the Russian people in future centuries.\n\n==Early reign of Ivan IV==\nThe development of the Tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign of Ivan IV, and he gained the sobriquet \"Grozny\". The English word ''terrible'' is usually used to translate the Russian word ''grozny'' in Ivan's nickname, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word ''grozny'' reflects the older English usage of ''terrible'' as in \"inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable\". It does not convey the more modern connotations of English ''terrible'', such as \"defective\" or \"evil\". [[Vladimir Dal]] defined ''grozny'' specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: \"Courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience\".<ref>Dal, Vladimir, [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]], article ''\u0413\u0420\u041e\u0417\u0418\u0422\u042c''.

The [[Shuysky]] and [[Belsky family (Gediminid)|Belsky]] factions of the [[boyar]]s competed for control of the regency until Ivan assumed the throne in 1547. Reflecting Moscow's new imperial claims, Ivan's coronation as Tsar was a ritual modeled after those of the Byzantine emperors. With the continuing assistance of a group of boyars, Ivan began his reign with a series of useful reforms. In the 1550s, he declared a new law code, revamped the military, and reorganized local government. These reforms undoubtedly were intended to strengthen the state in the face of continuous warfare. The key documents prepared by the so-called [[Izbrannaya Rada|Select Council]] of advisors and promulgated during this period are as follows:\n\n{{Muscovite Constitution}}\n\n==Foreign policies of Ivan IV==\n{{Main|Muscovite\u2013Lithuanian Wars|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Clocher d'Ivan le Grand.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], raised to the present height during the reign of [[Boris Godunov]]]]\n\n[[Muscovy (Grand Duchy)]] remained a fairly unknown society in Western Europe until Baron [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] published his [[Notes on Muscovite Affairs|Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]] (literally ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs'') in 1549. This provided a broad view of what had been a rarely visited and poorly reported state. In the 1630s, the Russian Tsardom was visited by [[Adam Olearius]], whose lively and well-informed writings were soon translated into all the major languages of [[Europe]].\n\nFurther information about Russia was circulated by English and Dutch [[merchant]]s. One of them, [[Richard Chancellor]], sailed to the [[White Sea]] in 1553 and continued overland to Moscow. Upon his return to England, the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by himself, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]], and several London merchants. Ivan IV used these merchants to exchange letters with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nDespite the domestic turmoil of the 1530s and 1540s, Russia continued to wage wars and to expand. It grew from 2.8 to 5.4 million square kilometers from 1533 to 1584.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, p. 80</ref> Ivan [[Russo-Kazan Wars|defeated and annexed]] the [[Khanate of Kazan]] on the middle [[Volga River|Volga]] in 1552 and later the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], where the Volga meets the [[Caspian Sea]]. These victories transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state, which it continues to be today. The tsar now controlled the entire Volga River and gained access to Central Asia.\n\nExpanding to the northwest toward the [[Baltic Sea]] proved to be much more difficult. In 1558, Ivan invaded [[Livonia]], eventually involving himself in a [[Livonian War|twenty-five-year war]] against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]. Despite occasional successes, Ivan's army was pushed back, and the nation failed to secure a coveted position on the Baltic Sea.\n\nHoping to make profit from Russia's concentration on Livonian affairs, [[Devlet I Giray]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], accompanied by as many as 120,000 horsemen, [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|repeatedly devastated the Moscow region]], until the [[Battle of Molodi]] put a stop to such northward incursions. But for decades to come, the southern borderland was annually pillaged by the [[Nogai Horde]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]], who took local inhabitants with them as slaves. Tens of thousands of soldiers protected the [[Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Belt]] \u2014 a burden for a state whose social and economic development was stagnating.\n\n==Oprichnina==\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n[[File:Apostol 1564 Frontispis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Apostle'' (1564) by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], one of the first Russian printed books]]\n\nDuring the late 1550s, Ivan developed a hostility toward his advisers, the government, and the [[boyar]]s. Historians have not determined whether policy differences, personal animosities, or mental imbalance caused his wrath. In 1565, he divided Russia into two parts: his private domain (or [[oprichnina]]) and the public realm (or [[zemshchina]]). For his private domain, Ivan chose some of the most prosperous and important districts of Russia. In these areas, Ivan's agents attacked boyars, merchants, and even common people, summarily executing some and confiscating land and possessions. Thus began a decade of terror in Russia that culminated in the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] (1570).\n\nAs a result of the policies of the ''oprichnina'', Ivan broke the economic and political power of the leading [[boyar]] families, thereby destroying precisely those persons who had built up Russia and were the most capable of administering it. Trade diminished, and peasants, faced with mounting taxes and threats of violence, began to leave Russia. [[George's Day in Autumn|Efforts to curtail the mobility of the peasants]] by tying them to their land brought Russia closer to legal [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]]. In 1572, Ivan finally abandoned the practices of the oprichnina.\n\nAccording to a popular theory,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{by whom|date=October 2015}} the oprichnina was started by Ivan in order to mobilize resources for the wars and to quell opposition. Regardless of the reason, Ivan's domestic and foreign policies had a devastating effect on Russia and led to a period of social struggle and civil war, the [[Time of Troubles]] (''Smutnoye vremya'', 1598-1613).\n\n==Time of Troubles==\n{{Main|Time of Troubles|Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)}}\nIvan IV was succeeded by his son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]], who was mentally deficient. Actual power went to Feodor's brother-in-law, the boyar [[Boris Godunov]] (who is credited with abolishing [[George's Day in Autumn|Yuri's Day]], the only time of the year when serfs were free to move from one landowner to another). Perhaps the most important event of Feodor's reign was the proclamation of the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1589. The creation of the patriarchate climaxed the evolution of a separate and totally independent [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn 1598, Feodor died without an heir, ending the [[Rurik]] Dynasty. Boris Godunov then convened a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'', a national assembly of boyars, church officials, and commoners, which proclaimed him tsar, although various boyar factions refused to recognize the decision. Widespread crop failures caused the [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]], and during the ensuing discontent, a man emerged who claimed to be [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Demetrius]], Ivan IV's son who had died in 1591. This pretender to the throne, who came to be known as [[False Dmitriy I]], gained support in Poland and marched to Moscow, gathering followers among the boyars and other elements as he went. Historians speculate<ref>[[Ruslan Skrynnikov]]. ''Boris Godunov''. Moscow: Nauka, 1983. Reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|5-17-010892-3}}.</ref> that Godunov would have weathered this crisis had he not died in 1605. As a result, False Dmitriy I entered Moscow and was crowned tsar that year, following the murder of Tsar [[Feodor II of Russia|Feodor II]], Godunov's son.\n\nSubsequently, Russia entered a period of continuous chaos, known as ''The [[Time of Troubles]]'' (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f). Despite the Tsar's persecution of the boyars, the townspeople's dissatisfaction, and the gradual enserfment of the peasantry, efforts at restricting the power of the Tsar were only halfhearted. Finding no institutional alternative to the autocracy, discontented Russians rallied behind various pretenders to the throne. During that period, the goal of political activity was to gain influence over the sitting autocrat or to place one's own candidate on the throne. The boyars fought among themselves, the lower classes revolted blindly, and foreign armies occupied [[the Kremlin]] in Moscow, prompting many to accept [[Tsarist autocracy]] as a necessary means to restoring order and unity in Russia.\n\n[[File:Lissner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Poles]] surrender the [[Moscow Kremlin]] to [[Prince Pozharsky]] in 1612. Painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]\nThe Time of Troubles included a civil war in which a struggle over the throne was complicated by the machinations of rival boyar factions, the intervention of regional powers Poland and Sweden, and intense popular discontent, led by [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]. False Dmitriy I and his Polish garrison were overthrown, and a boyar, [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]], was proclaimed tsar in 1606. In his attempt to retain the throne, Shuysky allied himself with the Swedes, unleashing the [[Ingrian War]] with Sweden. [[False Dmitry II]], allied with the Poles, appeared under the walls of Moscow and set up a mock court in the village of [[Tushino]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Poland intervened into Russian affairs officially]], captured Shuisky, and occupied the Kremlin. A group of Russian boyars signed in 1610 a treaty of peace, recognising [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|Ladislaus IV of Poland]], son of Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], as tsar. In 1611, [[False Dmitry III]] appeared in the Swedish-occupied territories, but was soon apprehended and executed. The Polish presence led to a patriotic revival among the Russians, and a volunteer army, financed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchants and blessed by the Orthodox Church, was formed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and, led by Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]], drove the Poles out of the Kremlin. In 1613, a [[zemsky Sobor]] proclaimed the boyar [[Michael of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]] as tsar, beginning the 300-year reign of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family.\n\n==Romanovs==\n[[File:Tsar boyar duma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Andrei Ryabushkin]]: ''Tsar Michael at the Session of the [[Boyar Duma]]'' (1893)]]\nThe immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore order. However, Russia's major enemies, Poland and Sweden, were engaged in a conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617. The [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)]] was ended with the [[Truce of Deulino]] in 1618, restoring temporarily Polish and Lithuanian rule over some territories, including [[Smolensk]], lost by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1509.\n\nThe early [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were weak rulers. Under Mikhail, state affairs were in the hands of the tsar's father, [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Filaret]], who in 1619 became Patriarch of Moscow. Later, Mikhail's son [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey]] (r. 1645-1676) relied on a boyar, [[Boris Morozov]], to run his government. Morozov abused his position by exploiting the populace, and in 1648 Aleksey dismissed him in the wake of the [[Salt Riot]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter [[Smolensk War|an unsuccessful attempt to regain Smolensk]] from Poland in 1632, Russia made peace with Poland in 1634. Polish king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], whose father and predecessor was [[Sigismund III Vasa]], had been elected by Russian boyars as tsar of Russia during the Time of Troubles, renounced all claims to the title as a condition of the peace treaty.\n\n==Legal code of 1649==\nThe [[autocracy]] survived the [[Time of Troubles]] and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central [[bureaucracy]]. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the ruler's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] or the [[boyar]] faction controlling the throne. In the 17th century, the bureaucracy expanded dramatically. The number of government departments (''prikazy'' ; sing., ''[[prikaz]]'' ) increased from twenty-two in 1613 to eighty by mid-century. Although the departments often had overlapping and conflicting [[jurisdiction]]s, the central government, through [[province|provincial]] governors, was able to control and regulate all social groups, as well as trade, manufacturing, and even the [[Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[File:Godfrey Kneller - Portrait of P.Potemkin (1682, Hermitage) - contrast.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Russian diplomat and [[voivode]] [[Pyotr Potemkin]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nThe [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye]], a comprehensive [[legal code]] introduced in 1649, illustrates the extent of state control over [[Russia]]n society. By that time, the boyars had largely merged with the new elite, who were obligatory servitors of the state, to form a new [[nobility]], the [[dvoryanstvo]]. The state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military because of permanent warfare on southern and western borders and attacks of [[nomad]]s. In return, the nobility received land and [[peasant]]s. In the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one [[landlord]] to another; the 1649 code officially attached peasants to their [[home]].\n\nThe state fully sanctioned [[serfdom]], and runaway peasants became state [[fugitive]]s. Landlords had complete power over their peasants<!--and bought, sold, traded, and [[mortgage]]d them-->. Peasants living on state-owned land, however, were not considered serfs. They were organized into [[commune]]s, which were responsible for taxes and other obligations. Like serfs, however, state peasants were attached to the land they farmed. Middle-class urban [[tradesmen]] and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes. By chaining much of Russian society to specific domiciles, the legal code of 1649 curtailed movement and subordinated the people to the interests of the state.\n\nUnder this code, increased state taxes and regulations altered the social discontent that had been simmering since the Time of Troubles. In the 1650s and 1660s, the number of peasant escapes increased dramatically. A favourite refuge was the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] region, domain of the [[Don Cossacks]]. A major uprising occurred in the [[Volga]] region in 1670 and 1671. [[Stenka Razin]], a Cossack who was from the Don River region, led a revolt that drew together wealthy Cossacks who were well established in the region and escaped serfs seeking free land. The unexpected uprising swept up the Volga River valley and even threatened Moscow. Tsarist troops finally defeated the rebels after they had occupied major cities along the Volga in an operation whose panache captured the imaginations of later generations of Russians. Razin was publicly tortured and executed.\n\n==Acquisition of Ukrainian lands==\n[[File:Russian clothes Soln.jpeg|thumb|A warrior of the Russian noble cavalry (''\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430'') during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War of 1654\u20131667]]. The drawing is based on the pieces preserved in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].]]\n\nThe Tsardom of Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century. In the southwest, it claimed eastern [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] lands, which had been under [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] rule and sought assistance from the Tsardom to leave the rule of the Commonwealth. The [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], warriors organized in military formations, lived in the frontier areas bordering Poland, the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] lands. Although part of them was serving in the Polish army as [[Registered Cossacks]], the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] remained fiercely independent and staged several rebellions against the Poles. In 1648, the peasants of what is now Ukraine joined the Cossacks in rebellion during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. Initially, Cossacks were allied with [[Crimean Tatars]], which had helped them to throw off Polish rule. Once the Poles convinced the Tartars to switch sides, the Zaporozhian Cossacks needed military help to maintain their position.\n\nIn 1648, the  [[Hetman]] (leader) of the [[Zaporozhian host|Zaporozhian Host]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to ally with the Russian [[tsar]], [[Alexis of Russia|Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer, which was ratified in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654, led to [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|a protracted war between Poland and Russia]]. The [[Truce of Andrusovo]], which did not involve the Hetmanate ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]) as a participating party of the agreement ended the war in 1667. Cossacks considered it as a Moscow betrayal. As a result, it split Ukrainian territory along the [[Dnieper River]], reuniting the western sector (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) with Poland and leaving the eastern sector ([[Left-bank Ukraine]]) self-governing under the sovereignty of the tsar. However, the self-government did not last long and Eastern Ukrainian territory was eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire (after the [[Battle of Poltava]]) during the 18th century.\n\n==Raskol (Schism)==\n{{Main|Raskol}}\n[[File:PhilipandNikon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Patriarch Nikon]] and Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] in the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]]]]\n\nRussia's southwestern expansion, particularly its incorporation of eastern Ukraine, had [[unintended consequence]]s. Most Ukrainians were Orthodox, but their close contact with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Polish also brought them Western intellectual currents. Through the Ukrainian [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Academy in Kiev]], Russia gained links to Polish and Central European influences and to the wider Orthodox world. Although the Ukrainian link induced creativity in many areas, it also weakened traditional Russian religious practices and culture. The Russian Orthodox Church discovered that its isolation from [[Constantinople]] had caused variations to appear between their [[liturgical book]]s and practices.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox patriarch, [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], was determined to bring the Russian texts back into conformity with the [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and practices of the time. But Nikon encountered opposition among the many Russians who viewed the corrections as improper foreign intrusions. When the Orthodox Church forced Nikon's reforms, a schism resulted in 1667. Those who did not accept the reforms came to be called the [[Old Believers]]; they were officially pronounced heretics and were persecuted by the church and the state. The chief opposition figure, the protopope [[Avvakum]], was burned at the stake. The split afterwards became permanent, and many merchants and peasants joined the Old Believers.\n\nThe tsar's court also felt the impact of Ukraine and the West. Kiev was a major transmitter of new ideas and insight through the famed scholarly [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|academy]] that [[Peter Mogila|Metropolitan Mohyla]] founded there in 1631. Other more direct channels to the West opened as international trade increased and more foreigners came to Russia. The Tsar's court was interested in the West's more advanced technology, particularly when military applications were involved. By the end of the 17th century, Ukrainian, Polish, and West European penetration had weakened the Russian cultural synthesis\u2014at least among the elite\u2014and had prepared the way for an even more radical transformation.\n\n==Conquest of Siberia==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n[[File:Surikov Pokoreniye Sibiri Yermakom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Vasily Surikov]]: ''Yermak's Conquest of Siberia'' (1895)]]\nRussia's eastward expansion encountered little resistance. In 1581, the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] merchant family, interested in the fur trade, hired a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] leader, [[Yermak Timofeyevich]], to lead an expedition into western [[Siberia]]. Yermak defeated the [[Khanate of Sibir]] and claimed the territories west of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh]] Rivers for Russia.\n\nFrom such bases as [[Mangazeya]], merchants, traders, and explorers pushed eastward from the [[Ob River]] to the [[Yenisei River]], then on to the [[Lena River]] and the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Cossack [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the passage between America and Asia. By the middle of the 17th century, Russians had reached the [[Amur River]] and the outskirts of the [[Late Imperial China|Chinese Empire]].\n\nAfter a period of conflict with the [[Qing dynasty]], Russia made peace with [[China]] in 1689. By the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], Russia ceded its claims to the Amur Valley, but it gained access to the region east of [[Lake Baikal]] and the trade route to [[Beijing]]. Peace with China strengthened the initial breakthrough to the Pacific that had been made in the middle of the century.\n\n==Reign of Peter the Great and establishment of the Russian Empire==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Main|Peter the Great|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity Church at Putinki]], an example of the 17th-century Russian [[uzorochye]] style]]\n\n[[Peter the Great]] (1672\u20131725), who became ruler in his own right in 1696, was destined to bring the Tsardom of Russia, which had little contact with Europe and was mostly seen as a regional power, into the mainstream of European culture and politics. After suppressing numerous rebellions with considerable bloodshed, Peter embarked on [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|a tour of Western Europe incognito]]. He became impressed with what he saw and was awakened to the backwardness of Russia. Peter began requiring the nobility to wear Western clothing and shave off their beards, an action that the [[boyar]]s protested bitterly. Arranged marriages among nobility were banned and the Orthodox Church brought under state control. Military academies were established to create a modern European-style army and officer corps in place of the disorganized levies that Muscovite rulers had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes did not win Peter many friends and in fact caused great political division in the country. These along with his notorious cruelties (such as the torture death of [[Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|his own son]] for plotting a rebellion) and the immense human suffering that accompanied many of his projects such as the construction of [[Saint Petersburg]] led many pious Russians to believe that he was the [[Antichrist]]. The [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]] consumed much of Peter's attention for years, however the Swedes were eventually defeated and peace agreed to in 1721. Russia annexed the Baltic coast from Sweden and parts of [[Finland]], which would become the site of the new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. The Russian victory in the Great Northern War marked a watershed in European politics, as it not only brought about the eclipse of Sweden and Poland as great powers, but also Russia's decisive emergence as a permanent factor in Europe. Expansion into Siberia also continued and [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u201323)|war]] with [[Persia]] brought about the acquisition of territory in the [[Caucasus]], although Russia surrendered those gains after Peter's death in 1725.\n\n==State flags==\nThere was no single flag during the Tsardom. Instead, there were multiple flags:\n*Standards used by the Tsar:<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n** '''Standard of the Tsar of Russia''' (1693\u20131700): white-blue-red tricolor with golden [[double-headed eagle]] in the center.<ref name=\"Civil\" /> Replaced by the Imperial standard in 1700 (see below).<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n**'''[[Russian Imperial Standard|Imperial Standard]] of the Tsar of Russia''': black double-headed eagle carrying St. Vladimir Red Coat of Arms, on a golden rectangular field, adopted in 1700 instead of the older white-blue-red Standard of the Tsar of Moscow.<ref name=\"Civil\" />\n*'''Civil Flag''': The early [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Tsars instituted the two-headed eagle Imperial Flag of the Tsar, which origin dates back to 1472, as a Civil Flag, it remained the Civil Flag of Russia until replaced during the Empire in 1858.<ref>Yenne, Bill.
