The university was founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1851 as Saint Joseph's College. Saint Joseph's is the seventh oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] university in the United States and one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]].\n\nSaint Joseph's University educates over 9,200 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students each year through the [[Erivan K. Haub School of Business]], the College of Arts and Sciences, the Program of Professional & Liberal Studies, and the Haub Degree Completion Program. The University offers over 60 undergraduate majors, 53 graduate programs, 28 study-abroad programs, 12 special-study options, a co-op program, a joint degree program with [[Thomas Jefferson University]], and an [[Ed.D.]] in Educational Leadership. It has 17 centers and institutes, including the Kinney Center for Autism Education & Support and the [[Pedro Arrupe]] Center for Business Ethics.\n\nSt. Joe's athletics teams, the Hawks, are an [[NCAA Division I]] program, competing in the [[Atlantic-10]] Conference and Philadelphia's [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big 5]]. The official colors of the university are crimson and gray. The school mascot is the [[The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University mascot)|Hawk]], which never stops flapping its wings while in costume.\n\n==Jesuit and Catholic identity==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's College Crest.JPG|325px|right|thumb|upright|The Seal of Saint Joseph's College, now University, at the Burns Library at Boston College]]\n\nApproximately 38 Jesuits live on campus with 10 serving as faculty. The university's Jesuit community lives in the [[Loyola Center]], directly across the street from [[Barbelin Hall]]. The Loyola Center joins Manresa Hall, the infirmary for Jesuits. The property features a Carriage House which serves as a meeting place and guest house. Other Jesuit residences include St. Alphonsus House (at 5800 Overbrook Avenue) and Faber Hall (39 Berwick Road). One Jesuit lives in a residence hall; the lay university president maintains an apartment in the Merion Gardens Apartment building.\n\nThe university extensively uses its Jesuit identity in its branding. It began the Magis (\"greater\") campaign in 2013 to highlight commitment to living \"For the greater glory of God\" (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]''), the motto of the [[Society of Jesus]].<ref name=Jesuit_Identity>{{cite web|author=Saint Joseph's University |url=http://www.sju.edu/jesuit-identity|title=Jesuit Identity.}}</ref>\n\nSJU also promotes the Jesuit principle of ''[[cura personalis]]'' or \"care for the whole person.\" Undergraduates must complete a general education program that focuses heavily on traditional liberal arts disciplines. Every general education class is titled \"154\", which stands for the year 1540 AD when the Society of Jesus was accepted by the Pope.\n\nOn September 27, 2015, [[Pope Francis]], a Jesuit, made a stop at the university during his two-day visit to Philadelphia.<ref name=\"Pope Francis Visits Campus\">{{cite web |author=SJU|url=http://sju.edu/news-events/news/pontiff-makes-historic-visit-philadelphias-jesuit-university|title=Pontiff Makes Historic Visit to Philadelphia's Jesuit University |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Seal===\nThe Seal of Saint Joseph's University signifies its history and values. Other Jesuit educational institutions share three of these symbols. The [[wolves]] over a kettle pot show the generosity of the Loyola family towards the poor. Tradition claims that the Loyolas provided so much food for their soldiers that even the wolves had enough to eat. IHS are the first three letters of the name of ''Jes''us in Greek, and the historic monogram of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The stripes signify the 7 sons of the House of Loyola, who died defending their home. The lily is the distinguishing symbol of the university, honoring [[Saint Joseph]], the school's patron saint. The seal is the graphical representation of Saint Joseph's and its Jesuit identity.<ref name=\"SJUSeal\">{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2010-11/UniversitySealupdated9-14withnewart_001.pdf|title=The University Seal|publisher=sju.edu|access-date=March 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302065528/http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2010-11/UniversitySealupdated9-14withnewart_001.pdf|archive-date=March 2, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n{{Main|List of presidents of Saint Joseph's University}}\n\nOn August 15, 2014, President [[Kevin Gillespie (academic)|C.

A national search for the next president commenced during 2014\u20132015 academic year and on April 22, 2015, the Board of Trustees announced [[Mark Reed (academic)|Mark C. Reed]], of [[Fairfield University]]. Reed is the first lay president of Saint Joseph's.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Saint Joseph's University Elects Mark C.

In addition, all students are required to complete a first-year seminar. Major coursework includes classes in English composition and literature, mathematics, philosophy, theology and religious studies, social science, world languages, and history. The courses are intended to be aligned with Jesuit ideals of social justice, service learning, ethics, and real-world application of theory. The GEP is the result of a university-wide curriculum overhaul implemented in the fall of 2010.\n\nOf tenure-track faculty, 98% hold the highest possible degrees in their fields. The 2008 graduation rate was 90% and the freshman retention rate for the Class of 2017 is 89.8%. About 51% of undergraduates are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences while 49% are enrolled in the Haub School of Business.<ref name=\"Facts\" /> The [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] classified Saint Joseph's among \"Master's Colleges and Universities (larger programs)\".\n\nThere are 17 centers and institutes including the Faith-Justice Institute, Institute for Catholic Bioethics, Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations, Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, [[Pedro Arrupe]] Center for Business Ethics, and the Richard Johnson Center for Anti-Violence. The university has chapters of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], and [[Alpha Sigma Nu]].\n\nThe university has four academic divisions:\n* College of Arts & Sciences\n* School of Health Studies and Education\n* [[Haub School of Business]]\n* Haub Degree Completion Program\n* Program of Professional & Liberal Studies\n\n===College of Arts & Sciences===\n\nThe College of Arts & Sciences comprises 21 departments, offering a wide array of majors and interdisciplinary minors in the humanities, social sciences, education, natural science, mathematics, and computer science. The McNulty Scholars Program aims to provide women in STEM fields extensive undergraduate research and mentorship, awarding full and associate level scholarships each year. The Summer Scholars Program awards competitive grants to students every summer to engage in research and creative projects under faculty mentorship.\n\nThe Professional & Liberal Studies program is Saint Joseph's undergraduate continuing studies division. As early as 1852, the administration at Saint Joseph's organized educational opportunities for adults. In addition to traditional on-campus programs and majors, PLS offers accelerated degree programs in English and professional communications, health administration, and leadership. PLS students wishing to pursue a degree during the day take advantage of the division's bridge program, and professionals in certain areas can take part in off-campus programs in professional communications, criminal justice, food marketing, and purchasing and acquisitions.\n\n===Erivan K.

A bridge which goes over City Avenue connects the two sides of the campus. Its {{convert|103|acre|km2}} are concentrated from Cardinal Avenue to 52nd Street and Overbrook Avenue to City Avenue. The university also owns several buildings which are not on the main campus. With the acquisition of the Maguire Campus, one half of the {{convert|114|acre|km2}} are located on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. In all, there are 92 buildings on the university's campus.<ref name=Map>{{cite web |url=http://www.sju.edu/sites/default/files/SJUCampusMap.pdf |title=SJU: Campus Map|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSt. Joe's is within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of [[La Salle University]], [[Harcum College]], [[Rosemont College]], [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Drexel University]], [[Temple University]], [[Swarthmore College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Haverford College]], [[Philadelphia University]], [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]], [[Cabrini College]], and [[Villanova University]]. [[SEPTA]] regional rail train stations on each side of campus provide students with easy access to Center City.\n\n===Main campus===\nThe main campus is located on the Philadelphia side of City Avenue between Cardinal and Overbrook Avenues and 52nd Street, and is the original location of the university when it moved to City Avenue in 1927. Saint Joseph's most recognizable building is [[Barbelin Hall]], opened in 1927. The hall is known for its [[Gothic architecture]], particularly the gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle (or Barbelin Courtyard) and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the university's logo for several years. Barbelin Hall was built by [[John McShain]] who would later go on to construct many buildings in Washington, D.C., such as [[The Pentagon]] and [[The Jefferson Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Hennelly, Meghan |url=http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2009/03/04/Features/Figures.On.Barbelin.Immortalize.Past.Presidents.And.1920s.Culture-3657318.shtml |title=Figures on Barbelin immortalize past presidents and 1920s culture |publisher=sju.edu |access-date=March 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307060552/http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2009/03/04/Features/Figures.On.Barbelin.Immortalize.Past.Presidents.And.1920s.Culture-3657318.shtml |archive-date=March 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:StJoseph Statue.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St. Joseph statue]]\nMain campus contains the majority of academic buildings, first-year residence halls, and campus houses. Barbelin (College of Arts & Sciences), Mandeville (Haub School of Business), Bellarmine, Post, and Science Center comprise the main academic halls. Campus houses are a prominent feature of main campus serving as departmental offices for fine arts (Boland Hall), communication studies (Bronstein Hall), and the President and Provost (Regis Hall), as well as several housing options for first-year students and upperclassmen. Green spaces on campus include St. Mary's, Claver House, and Wolfington lawns located on the Main Campus, in addition to two quadrangles, College Hall Quad and Barbelin Quad.\n\nThe Post Academic Center is the university's main library, the result of a renovation of the original Francis A. Drexel Library and an expansion project called the Post Learning Commons, from 2011-2013. Drexel Library and Post Learning Commons are connected via a glass atrium and bridge through the heart of campus. Post Academic Center houses approximately 355,000 volumes, 1,450 print journals, 15,000 full-text electronic journals, 2,800 e-books, 866,000 microforms, and 4,975 audio-visual materials. Unique to the Post Academic Center is the Campbell Collection in Food Marketing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Facts & Figures {{!}} Saint Joseph's University |url=http://sju.edu/about-sju/facts-figures|website = sju.edu|accessdate = May 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCampion Student Center is the hub for student activities, student life administrative offices, and dining facilities. The building was renovated in 2008 and now includes the main dining hall; a food court featuring Grille Works, Subway, and Hawk Wrap; and the C-Store. The student center also features the Doyle Banquet Halls, Forum Theater, and President's Lounge used for larger gatherings and lectures on campus. Located just off Campion Student Center is Simpson Hall which houses the Student Media Center and The Perch, a 24-hour student lounge.\n\nIn September 2012, the university purchased the adjacent Cardinal's Residence on 54th and Cardinal Avenue from the [[Archdiocese of Philadelphia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = SJU, Archdiocese Sign Letter of Intent for Purchase of the Cardinal's Residence {{!}} Saint Joseph's University|url = http://www.sju.edu/news-events/news/cardinals-residence-agreement|website = www.sju.edu|accessdate = May 2, 2015}}</ref> Beginning with the fall 2014 semester, the Cardinal's Residence was renamed 5800 City Ave. It serves as a welcome center for prospective families and has offices for all enrollment management operations.\n\n===James J. Maguire '58 Campus===\nOn August 8, 2008, Saint Joseph's completed the acquisition of the adjacent [[Episcopal Academy]] after purchasing the property in 2005. The new 38-acre area (150,000 m<sup>2</sup>) was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, Saint Joseph's alumnus James Maguire. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. The Maguire Campus features three main academic buildings: Merion Hall, Connelly Hall, and Toland Hall. Merion Hall is the largest of the three, and includes the University Gallery.\n\nThe Cardinal John Foley Center, a multi-use space, hosts lectures, concerts, and social gatherings, in addition to large-scale admission events. The Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, established in 2009, was made possible with donations totaling over $8 million, and is located in Connelly Hall. Duperreault, Quinn, and Windrim Halls are campus houses serving as administrative space for University Advancement.\n\nAthletic facilities include the Michael A. O'Pake, Esq. '61 Recreation Center, Ellen Ryan Field (field hockey), John Smithson Field (baseball), Curran Lawn, and a softball field.\n\nAlong with all of the buildings and fields, the Maguire Campus adds over 300 parking spaces for faculty and students, and a number of acres will be turned into green space. There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire Campus.\n\n===Overbrook Campus===\nThe Overbrook Campus is located about a mile from and Main Campus, near [[Overbrook (SEPTA station)|Overbrook Train Station]]. Here also Saint Joseph's University owns buildings on both sides of City Avenue. Currently the campus holds six dorms, reserved exclusively for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. These dorms are Ashwood Apartments, Wynnewood Hall, Merion Gardens Apartments, Pennbrook Apartments, Morris Quad Townhouses, and Moore Hall. The campus also holds the Alumni House.<ref name=Map/>\n\nAlthough it is located about a mile from the main campus, Saint Joseph's University runs shuttles every 30 minutes (and 15 minutes during peak hours) to accommodate students.\n\n===Housing===\n{{main|List_of_Saint_Joseph's_University_buildings#Residence_Halls|l1=Housing at Saint Joseph's}}\nApproximately 80% of students at Saint Joseph's live on campus, and on-campus residency is required for freshmen and sophomores. Housing options include residence halls, apartments, townhouses, and campus houses.\n\nFirst-year students can choose from traditional residence halls (McShain Hall and Villiger Hall), suite-style residence halls (Sourin Residence Center and LaFarge Residence Center), or campus houses (Tara and Quirk Halls). Villiger Hall, the university's newest residence, opened in August 2012. All first-year housing options are located on the main campus.\n\nSophomores, juniors, and seniors can choose to live in several campus houses, including Hogan, St. Albert's, Sullivan, St. Mary's, and Xavier Halls. Apartment-style living is available on campus at Pennbrook, Ashwood, Rashford, Lannon, and Wynnewood. On the main campus the two apartment buildings that are available are Lannon and Rashford Hall. The two apartment styles are four to a room. Each room is equipped with a fill kitchen, one half bath, a full bathroom, a living area and two rooms. Each room had two students living there with a desk, bed, closet and a night stand for each student. Other apartment styles like Wynnewood, Ashwood, and Pennbrook has more options to live with more roommates at a time. There are two exclusive junior-senior living communities in the Merion Gardens Apartments and the Morris Quad Townhouses, and six Residential-Learning Communities focused on Science (freshmen), Emerging Leaders (freshmen), Business (freshmen), Romero (upperclassmen), Arts (upperclassmen), and Business (upperclassmen).\n\n===Current developments and plans===\nDuring a presentation to the faculty in April 2013, President Kevin Gillespie, S.J., announced that, partially thanks to the popular Magis campaign, the university was beginning to expand, as it has a freshman class of 1,300 students enrolled for the fall of 2013. By 2017, it hoped to enroll 6,000 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magis Campaign a Success? |author=Taylor Rizzolino |newspaper= The Hawk Newspaper |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe university is heading into the final leg of its strategic plan, ''Plan 2020: Gateway to the Future'', focused on increased academic distinction, facility enhancements, and endowment growth. The university has raised over $12.1 million and created 40 new scholarships under President Gillespie's ''Magis'' Scholarship Initiative.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Donor Inspiration Advances President's Magis Scholarship Initiative {{!}} SJU President's Message \u2013 Winter 2015 |url = http://presidentreport.sju.edu/2015winter/articles/donor-inspiration-advances-presidents-magis-scholarship-initiative/ |website = presidentreport.sju.edu |access-date = May 2, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150417034008/http://presidentreport.sju.edu/2015winter/articles/donor-inspiration-advances-presidents-magis-scholarship-initiative/ |archive-date = April 17, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLarger campus enhancement projects include a new dining hall and black box theatre on Maguire Campus, and an expansion of Mandeville Hall currently on hold due to funding concerns.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Mandeville addition on hold |url = http://www.hawkhillnews.com/article/2014/11/mandeville-addition-on-hold |access-date = May 2, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150213080611/http://www.hawkhillnews.com/article/2014/11/mandeville-addition-on-hold |archive-date = February 13, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAdditional projects include an acquisition of the [[Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation]] which is adjacent to the university's campus in Lower Merion Township. The proposed acquisition is currently pending in the Montgomery County Orphans' Court, and would be a significant addition to the university. Should this be accepted, the university would offer a [[horticulture]] minor program, as well as provide a fine arts gallery, including murals by famed artist [[Henri Matisse]]. This expansion has been largely possible due to a historical $50m gift made in 2017 by alumnus James Maguire ('58).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Demographics===\nSaint Joseph's 8,860 students come from all over the United States, with most from the Northeast, including Pennsylvania.<ref name=USNWR_General>{{cite web|author=US News and World Reports|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/st-josephs-university-3367|title=Saint Joseph's University|publisher=US News and World Reports|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> Of these students 4,670 are traditional undergraduates, while the university's graduate and professional student population is numbered at 3,580.<ref name=\"USNWR_General\"/>\n\n{|style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Demographics of student body - fall 2012<ref name=\"Head count\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2012-13/Fall%202012%20HEOA%20disclosure-demographics-pell%20students.pdf|title=Degree Student Head Count: Fall 2010|publisher=Saint Joseph's University|access-date=March 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308014908/http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2012-13/Fall%202012%20HEOA%20disclosure-demographics-pell%20students.pdf|archive-date=March 8, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>See [[Demographics of the United States]] for references.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2013_enrollment.pdf |title=Fall Headcount Enrollment, 2008-2012 |publisher=The Office of the Provost |date= |access-date=December 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182502/http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2013_enrollment.pdf |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=c2010>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf |title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref>\n! !!

The school colors are crimson and gray. SJU fields teams in 20 varsity sports in Division I of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. The Hawks are part of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. Since the Atlantic 10 does not support men's [[lacrosse]], the Hawks play in the [[Northeast Conference]] for that sport only.\n\nAlong with the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph's is a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]] which intensifies local rivalries within Philadelphia City Schools. Its effect on Saint Joseph's causes intense games with [[Temple University]], [[Villanova University]], [[the University of Pennsylvania]], and inter-conference rival [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]].\n\nSaint Joseph's is also a member of the [[City 6]]. Similar to the Big 5, the City 6 comprises the entire [[Philadelphia Big 5]] plus [[Drexel University]], which did not participate in [[NCAA Division 1]] Athletics until 1973. In addition to official team rivalries, the local colleges also compete in various extramural sporting events to crown a City 6 Champion.\n\n===The Hawk mascot===\n{{main|The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University mascot)}}\n\nOne of the most famous mascots in college sports, the Saint Joseph's Hawk has been flapping its wings for over 50 years. Jim Brennan originated the idea for a hawk as mascot during the 1954-55 season. Brennan, an ex-Marine and SJU cheerleader, at first wanted to secure an actual hawk, but later switched to the costume idea. The student government raised the $120 needed to buy the initial costume, which Brennan donned for three years. He made his debut as the Hawk on January 4, 1956, at a 69-56 win over [[La Salle University]] at the Palestra.<ref name=\"The Hawk\">{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sjuhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208883426&DB_OEM_ID=31200|title=The Hawk|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawk is best known for staying in constant motion by flapping its wings throughout every basketball game, and for representing the Saint Joseph's motto, \"The Hawk Will Never Die\". It is also recognized by its \"flying\" in figure eights around the court during timeouts.<ref name=\"The Hawk\"/>\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main|Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball}}\n{{see also|Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Saint Joseph's-Temple rivalry|Philadelphia Big 5}}\n\nWhile Saint Joseph's fields 20 NCAA sports, the university's most popular sport is men's basketball. Saint Joseph's has a rich basketball tradition. Most home games are played at [[Hagan Arena]] on the school's campus, while some games are played at the [[Palestra]] on the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus.\n\nSaint Joseph's major rival is [[Villanova University]]. The rivalry is known as the [[Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Holy War]], although starting in 2013 both schools requested that the media refrain from using the term.<ref name=\"Holy War\">{{cite web |author=Mike Jensen|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-12-07/sports/44869008_1_army-navy-game-holy-war-basketball-game|title=Seeking an end to 'Holy War'|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> The school also maintains intense rivalries with the other Philadelphia universities.\n\nFans of the Hawks often chant \"The Hawk Will Never Die!\". Since the school's undefeated regular season, this chant has gained familiarity with the team's opponents. In 2003, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' listed that cheer among \"The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)\", calling it \"the most defiant cheer in college sports.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/sioncampus/09/24/100_things0930/|title=The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Athletic facilities===\n[[File:Finnessey.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Barbelin Hall & Finnesey Field]]\n*'''John Smithson Field''': Named after alum and former interim president John Smithson, the Hawks on-campus baseball field opened in 2012 on Maguire Campus. It features a synthetic surface with a dirt pitching mound and an AstroTurf 3D GameDay Grass surface. Bleacher seating capacity is 400 with much more space for standing room only.\n*'''SJU Softball Field''': The softball team opened their on-campus field in 2012. It features a turf outfield and bleacher seating for 400 spectators.\n*'''[[Gillin Boat Club|Robert Gillin Jr., Boathouse]]''': Saint Joseph's University celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2000'''[[Gillin Boat Club|2]]'''\u2013'''[[Gillin Boat Club|0]]'''01. In conjunction with that celebration, the SJU Rowing Progra, along with [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School|Saint Joseph's Pre]], kicked off a capital campaign to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art boathouse on the Schuylkill River. The boathouse provides a permanent home for the Hawk rowing programs. In addition, it provides the University with a significant presence on Kelly Drive. Named in honor of Robert Gillin Jr., groundbreaking for the facility took place in the fall of 2001. The total cost for the project was approximately $3 million, plus an endowment fund to support ongoing operational costs.\n*'''[[Sweeney Field]]''': Laid out in a natural bowl in the center of Saint Joseph's campus, Sweeney Field (formerly known as Finnesey Field) is the home field of Hawk soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey teams. Originally constructed for football and opened in 1929 with plans for an eventual 70,000-seat stadium, the field has undergone numerous changes over the years.\n*'''Tennis Complex at the Maguire Campus''': The tennis team moved to the six refurbished courts on the Maguire Campus in 2009 with the first SJU Invitational.\n*'''Finnesey Courts''': Adjacent to Sweeney Field stand the Finnesey Courts and home to the Hawk men's and women's tennis teams from the late 1940s until 2009. Prior to that SJU primarily played its home matches at the nearby Narberth courts. When courts were first built on campus, they were located where Bellarmine Hall now stands. Due to Bellarmine's construction in the summer of 1960, however, the Finnesey courts were torn down and rebuilt in their current location. These courts are still used by students.\n[[File:HaganArea 01.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Hagan Arena]]\n*'''[[Michael J. Hagan Arena]]''': The on-campus home of the Hawks basketball teams was originally named '''Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse''' for the Saint Joseph's graduates who gave their lives in [[World War II]]. The building was officially dedicated on November 11, 1949, and two weeks later played host to its first basketball game, a 62\u201346 loss to Rhode Island on November 26. Following that initial setback, SJU would go on to win the next 23 games in the friendly confines of the Fieldhouse. Overall, the Hawks have compiled an impressive 305\u201376 record (80.0 winning percentage) on Hawk Hill. Among the highlights of the Hawks' home court advantage was a 34-game winning streak from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, an 11\u20130 record in 2000\u201301, and the unbeaten 11\u20130 mark as the Hawks made their perfect season run in 2003\u201304. All told, SJU has had only two losing records in the Fieldhouse over 57 seasons. The Fieldhouse held 3,200 fans but the arena has a capacity of 4,200. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke at the Fieldhouse in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/facilities/stjs-facilities.html|title=SJU: Facilities|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref>\n*'''Ellen Ryan Field''': The Field Hockey team returned to campus after a multi-year hiatus with the addition of Ellen Ryan Field on the Maguire Campus in 2011. Ryan Field has a synthetic AstroTurf12 pitch and is situated adjacent to City Avenue.\n\nThe university also has a 240 by 120 four-court multi-purpose area for basketball, tennis, and volleyball, an indoor four-lane {{convert|200|yd|m|adj=on}} jogging track, an 8-lane 25-meter indoor pool with a 300-seat observation area, four racquetball courts, locker rooms and saunas, a large fitness center, and nine outdoor tennis courts.

The university was founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1851 as Saint Joseph's College. Saint Joseph's is the seventh oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] university in the United States and one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]].\n\nSaint Joseph's University educates over 9,200 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students each year through the [[Erivan K. Haub School of Business]], the College of Arts and Sciences, the Program of Professional & Liberal Studies, and the Haub Degree Completion Program. The University offers over 60 undergraduate majors, 53 graduate programs, 28 study-abroad programs, 12 special-study options, a co-op program, a joint degree program with [[Thomas Jefferson University]], and an [[Ed.D.]] in Educational Leadership. It has 17 centers and institutes, including the Kinney Center for Autism Education & Support and the [[Pedro Arrupe]] Center for Business Ethics.\n\nSt. Joe's athletics teams, the Hawks, are an [[NCAA Division I]] program, competing in the [[Atlantic-10]] Conference and Philadelphia's [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big 5]]. The official colors of the university are crimson and gray. The school mascot is the [[The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University mascot)|Hawk]], which never stops flapping its wings while in costume.\n\n==Jesuit and Catholic identity==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's College Crest.JPG|325px|right|thumb|upright|The Seal of Saint Joseph's College, now University, at the Burns Library at Boston College]]\n\nApproximately 38 Jesuits live on campus with 10 serving as faculty. The university's Jesuit community lives in the [[Loyola Center]], directly across the street from [[Barbelin Hall]]. The Loyola Center joins Manresa Hall, the infirmary for Jesuits. The property features a Carriage House which serves as a meeting place and guest house. Other Jesuit residences include St. Alphonsus House (at 5800 Overbrook Avenue) and Faber Hall (39 Berwick Road). One Jesuit lives in a residence hall; the lay university president maintains an apartment in the Merion Gardens Apartment building.\n\nThe university extensively uses its Jesuit identity in its branding. It began the Magis (\"greater\") campaign in 2013 to highlight commitment to living \"For the greater glory of God\" (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]''), the motto of the [[Society of Jesus]].<ref name=Jesuit_Identity>{{cite web|author=Saint Joseph's University |url=http://www.sju.edu/jesuit-identity|title=Jesuit Identity.}}</ref>\n\nSJU also promotes the Jesuit principle of ''[[cura personalis]]'' or \"care for the whole person.\" Undergraduates must complete a general education program that focuses heavily on traditional liberal arts disciplines. Every general education class is titled \"154\", which stands for the year 1540 AD when the Society of Jesus was accepted by the Pope.\n\nOn September 27, 2015, [[Pope Francis]], a Jesuit, made a stop at the university during his two-day visit to Philadelphia.<ref name=\"Pope Francis Visits Campus\">{{cite web |author=SJU|url=http://sju.edu/news-events/news/pontiff-makes-historic-visit-philadelphias-jesuit-university|title=Pontiff Makes Historic Visit to Philadelphia's Jesuit University |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Seal===\nThe Seal of Saint Joseph's University signifies its history and values. Other Jesuit educational institutions share three of these symbols. The [[wolves]] over a kettle pot show the generosity of the Loyola family towards the poor. Tradition claims that the Loyolas provided so much food for their soldiers that even the wolves had enough to eat. IHS are the first three letters of the name of ''Jes''us in Greek, and the historic monogram of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The stripes signify the 7 sons of the House of Loyola, who died defending their home. The lily is the distinguishing symbol of the university, honoring [[Saint Joseph]], the school's patron saint. The seal is the graphical representation of Saint Joseph's and its Jesuit identity.<ref name=\"SJUSeal\">{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2010-11/UniversitySealupdated9-14withnewart_001.pdf|title=The University Seal|publisher=sju.edu|access-date=March 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302065528/http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2010-11/UniversitySealupdated9-14withnewart_001.pdf|archive-date=March 2, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n{{Main|List of presidents of Saint Joseph's University}}\n\nOn August 15, 2014, President [[Kevin Gillespie (academic)|C.

The courses are intended to be aligned with Jesuit ideals of social justice, service learning, ethics, and real-world application of theory. The GEP is the result of a university-wide curriculum overhaul implemented in the fall of 2010.\n\nOf tenure-track faculty, 98% hold the highest possible degrees in their fields. The 2008 graduation rate was 90% and the freshman retention rate for the Class of 2017 is 89.8%. About 51% of undergraduates are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences while 49% are enrolled in the Haub School of Business.<ref name=\"Facts\" /> The [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] classified Saint Joseph's among \"Master's Colleges and Universities (larger programs)\".\n\nThere are 17 centers and institutes including the Faith-Justice Institute, Institute for Catholic Bioethics, Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations, Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, [[Pedro Arrupe]] Center for Business Ethics, and the Richard Johnson Center for Anti-Violence. The university has chapters of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], and [[Alpha Sigma Nu]].\n\nThe university has four academic divisions:\n* College of Arts & Sciences\n* School of Health Studies and Education\n* [[Haub School of Business]]\n* Haub Degree Completion Program\n* Program of Professional & Liberal Studies\n\n===College of Arts & Sciences===\n\nThe College of Arts & Sciences comprises 21 departments, offering a wide array of majors and interdisciplinary minors in the humanities, social sciences, education, natural science, mathematics, and computer science. The McNulty Scholars Program aims to provide women in STEM fields extensive undergraduate research and mentorship, awarding full and associate level scholarships each year. The Summer Scholars Program awards competitive grants to students every summer to engage in research and creative projects under faculty mentorship.\n\nThe Professional & Liberal Studies program is Saint Joseph's undergraduate continuing studies division. As early as 1852, the administration at Saint Joseph's organized educational opportunities for adults. In addition to traditional on-campus programs and majors, PLS offers accelerated degree programs in English and professional communications, health administration, and leadership. PLS students wishing to pursue a degree during the day take advantage of the division's bridge program, and professionals in certain areas can take part in off-campus programs in professional communications, criminal justice, food marketing, and purchasing and acquisitions.\n\n===Erivan K.

A bridge which goes over City Avenue connects the two sides of the campus. Its {{convert|103|acre|km2}} are concentrated from Cardinal Avenue to 52nd Street and Overbrook Avenue to City Avenue. The university also owns several buildings which are not on the main campus. With the acquisition of the Maguire Campus, one half of the {{convert|114|acre|km2}} are located on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. In all, there are 92 buildings on the university's campus.<ref name=Map>{{cite web |url=http://www.sju.edu/sites/default/files/SJUCampusMap.pdf |title=SJU: Campus Map|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSt. Joe's is within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of [[La Salle University]], [[Harcum College]], [[Rosemont College]], [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Drexel University]], [[Temple University]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Haverford College]], [[Philadelphia University]], [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]], [[Cabrini College]], and [[Villanova University]]. [[SEPTA]] regional rail train stations on each side of campus provide students with easy access to Center City.\n\n===Main campus===\nThe main campus is located on the Philadelphia side of City Avenue between Cardinal and Overbrook Avenues and 52nd Street, and is the original location of the university when it moved to City Avenue in 1927. Saint Joseph's most recognizable building is [[Barbelin Hall]], opened in 1927. The hall is known for its [[Gothic architecture]], particularly the gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle (or Barbelin Courtyard) and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the university's logo for several years. Barbelin Hall was built by [[John McShain]] who would later go on to construct many buildings in Washington, D.C., such as [[The Pentagon]] and [[The Jefferson Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Hennelly, Meghan |url=http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2009/03/04/Features/Figures.On.Barbelin.Immortalize.Past.Presidents.And.1920s.Culture-3657318.shtml |title=Figures on Barbelin immortalize past presidents and 1920s culture |publisher=sju.edu |access-date=March 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307060552/http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2009/03/04/Features/Figures.On.Barbelin.Immortalize.Past.Presidents.And.1920s.Culture-3657318.shtml |archive-date=March 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:StJoseph Statue.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St. Joseph statue]]\nMain campus contains the majority of academic buildings, first-year residence halls, and campus houses. Barbelin (College of Arts & Sciences), Mandeville (Haub School of Business), Bellarmine, Post, and Science Center comprise the main academic halls. Campus houses are a prominent feature of main campus serving as departmental offices for fine arts (Boland Hall), communication studies (Bronstein Hall), and the President and Provost (Regis Hall), as well as several housing options for first-year students and upperclassmen. Green spaces on campus include St. Mary's, Claver House, and Wolfington lawns located on the Main Campus, in addition to two quadrangles, College Hall Quad and Barbelin Quad.\n\nThe Post Academic Center is the university's main library, the result of a renovation of the original Francis A. Drexel Library and an expansion project called the Post Learning Commons, from 2011-2013. Drexel Library and Post Learning Commons are connected via a glass atrium and bridge through the heart of campus. Post Academic Center houses approximately 355,000 volumes, 1,450 print journals, 15,000 full-text electronic journals, 2,800 e-books, 866,000 microforms, and 4,975 audio-visual materials. Unique to the Post Academic Center is the Campbell Collection in Food Marketing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Facts & Figures {{!}} Saint Joseph's University |url=http://sju.edu/about-sju/facts-figures|website = sju.edu|accessdate = May 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCampion Student Center is the hub for student activities, student life administrative offices, and dining facilities. The building was renovated in 2008 and now includes the main dining hall; a food court featuring Grille Works, Subway, and Hawk Wrap; and the C-Store. The student center also features the Doyle Banquet Halls, Forum Theater, and President's Lounge used for larger gatherings and lectures on campus. Located just off Campion Student Center is Simpson Hall which houses the Student Media Center and The Perch, a 24-hour student lounge.\n\nIn September 2012, the university purchased the adjacent Cardinal's Residence on 54th and Cardinal Avenue from the [[Archdiocese of Philadelphia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = SJU, Archdiocese Sign Letter of Intent for Purchase of the Cardinal's Residence {{!}} Saint Joseph's University|url = http://www.sju.edu/news-events/news/cardinals-residence-agreement|website = www.sju.edu|accessdate = May 2, 2015}}</ref> Beginning with the fall 2014 semester, the Cardinal's Residence was renamed 5800 City Ave. It serves as a welcome center for prospective families and has offices for all enrollment management operations.\n\n===James J. Maguire '58 Campus===\nOn August 8, 2008, Saint Joseph's completed the acquisition of the adjacent [[Episcopal Academy]] after purchasing the property in 2005. The new 38-acre area (150,000 m<sup>2</sup>) was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, Saint Joseph's alumnus James Maguire. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. The Maguire Campus features three main academic buildings: Merion Hall, Connelly Hall, and Toland Hall. Merion Hall is the largest of the three, and includes the University Gallery.\n\nThe Cardinal John Foley Center, a multi-use space, hosts lectures, concerts, and social gatherings, in addition to large-scale admission events. The Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, established in 2009, was made possible with donations totaling over $8 million, and is located in Connelly Hall. Duperreault, Quinn, and Windrim Halls are campus houses serving as administrative space for University Advancement.\n\nAthletic facilities include the Michael A. O'Pake, Esq. '61 Recreation Center, Ellen Ryan Field (field hockey), John Smithson Field (baseball), Curran Lawn, and a softball field.\n\nAlong with all of the buildings and fields, the Maguire Campus adds over 300 parking spaces for faculty and students, and a number of acres will be turned into green space. There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire Campus.\n\n===Overbrook Campus===\nThe Overbrook Campus is located about a mile from and Main Campus, near [[Overbrook (SEPTA station)|Overbrook Train Station]]. Here also Saint Joseph's University owns buildings on both sides of City Avenue. Currently the campus holds six dorms, reserved exclusively for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. These dorms are Ashwood Apartments, Wynnewood Hall, Merion Gardens Apartments, Pennbrook Apartments, Morris Quad Townhouses, and Moore Hall. The campus also holds the Alumni House.<ref name=Map/>\n\nAlthough it is located about a mile from the main campus, Saint Joseph's University runs shuttles every 30 minutes (and 15 minutes during peak hours) to accommodate students.\n\n===Housing===\n{{main|List_of_Saint_Joseph's_University_buildings#Residence_Halls|l1=Housing at Saint Joseph's}}\nApproximately 80% of students at Saint Joseph's live on campus, and on-campus residency is required for freshmen and sophomores. Housing options include residence halls, apartments, townhouses, and campus houses.\n\nFirst-year students can choose from traditional residence halls (McShain Hall and Villiger Hall), suite-style residence halls (Sourin Residence Center and LaFarge Residence Center), or campus houses (Tara and Quirk Halls). Villiger Hall, the university's newest residence, opened in August 2012. All first-year housing options are located on the main campus.\n\nSophomores, juniors, and seniors can choose to live in several campus houses, including Hogan, St. Albert's, Sullivan, St. Mary's, and Xavier Halls. Apartment-style living is available on campus at Pennbrook, Ashwood, Rashford, Lannon, and Wynnewood. On the main campus the two apartment buildings that are available are Lannon and Rashford Hall. The two apartment styles are four to a room. Each room is equipped with a fill kitchen, one half bath, a full bathroom, a living area and two rooms. Each room had two students living there with a desk, bed, closet and a night stand for each student. Other apartment styles like Wynnewood, Ashwood, and Pennbrook has more options to live with more roommates at a time. There are two exclusive junior-senior living communities in the Merion Gardens Apartments and the Morris Quad Townhouses, and six Residential-Learning Communities focused on Science (freshmen), Emerging Leaders (freshmen), Business (freshmen), Romero (upperclassmen), Arts (upperclassmen), and Business (upperclassmen).\n\n===Current developments and plans===\nDuring a presentation to the faculty in April 2013, President Kevin Gillespie, S.J., announced that, partially thanks to the popular Magis campaign, the university was beginning to expand, as it has a freshman class of 1,300 students enrolled for the fall of 2013. By 2017, it hoped to enroll 6,000 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magis Campaign a Success? |author=Taylor Rizzolino |newspaper= The Hawk Newspaper |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe university is heading into the final leg of its strategic plan, ''Plan 2020: Gateway to the Future'', focused on increased academic distinction, facility enhancements, and endowment growth. The university has raised over $12.1 million and created 40 new scholarships under President Gillespie's ''Magis'' Scholarship Initiative.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Donor Inspiration Advances President's Magis Scholarship Initiative {{!}} SJU President's Message \u2013 Winter 2015 |url = http://presidentreport.sju.edu/2015winter/articles/donor-inspiration-advances-presidents-magis-scholarship-initiative/ |website = presidentreport.sju.edu |access-date = May 2, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150417034008/http://presidentreport.sju.edu/2015winter/articles/donor-inspiration-advances-presidents-magis-scholarship-initiative/ |archive-date = April 17, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLarger campus enhancement projects include a new dining hall and black box theatre on Maguire Campus, and an expansion of Mandeville Hall currently on hold due to funding concerns.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Mandeville addition on hold |url = http://www.hawkhillnews.com/article/2014/11/mandeville-addition-on-hold |access-date = May 2, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150213080611/http://www.hawkhillnews.com/article/2014/11/mandeville-addition-on-hold |archive-date = February 13, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAdditional projects include an acquisition of the [[Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation]] which is adjacent to the university's campus in Lower Merion Township. The proposed acquisition is currently pending in the Montgomery County Orphans' Court, and would be a significant addition to the university. Should this be accepted, the university would offer a [[horticulture]] minor program, as well as provide a fine arts gallery, including murals by famed artist [[Henri Matisse]]. This expansion has been largely possible due to a historical $50m gift made in 2017 by alumnus James Maguire ('58).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Demographics===\nSaint Joseph's 8,860 students come from all over the United States, with most from the Northeast, including Pennsylvania.<ref name=USNWR_General>{{cite web|author=US News and World Reports|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/st-josephs-university-3367|title=Saint Joseph's University|publisher=US News and World Reports|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> Of these students 4,670 are traditional undergraduates, while the university's graduate and professional student population is numbered at 3,580.<ref name=\"USNWR_General\"/>\n\n{|style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Demographics of student body - fall 2012<ref name=\"Head count\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2012-13/Fall%202012%20HEOA%20disclosure-demographics-pell%20students.pdf|title=Degree Student Head Count: Fall 2010|publisher=Saint Joseph's University|access-date=March 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308014908/http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/ir/pdf/2012-13/Fall%202012%20HEOA%20disclosure-demographics-pell%20students.pdf|archive-date=March 8, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>See [[Demographics of the United States]] for references.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2013_enrollment.pdf |title=Fall Headcount Enrollment, 2008-2012 |publisher=The Office of the Provost |date= |access-date=December 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182502/http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2013_enrollment.pdf |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=c2010>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf |title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref>\n! !!

Since the Atlantic 10 does not support men's [[lacrosse]], the Hawks play in the [[Northeast Conference]] for that sport only.\n\nAlong with the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph's is a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]] which intensifies local rivalries within Philadelphia City Schools. Its effect on Saint Joseph's causes intense games with [[Temple University]], [[Villanova University]], [[the University of Pennsylvania]], and inter-conference rival [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]].\n\nSaint Joseph's is also a member of the [[City 6]]. Similar to the Big 5, the City 6 comprises the entire [[Philadelphia Big 5]] plus [[Drexel University]], which did not participate in [[NCAA Division 1]] Athletics until 1973. In addition to official team rivalries, the local colleges also compete in various extramural sporting events to crown a City 6 Champion.\n\n===The Hawk mascot===\n{{main|The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University mascot)}}\n\nOne of the most famous mascots in college sports, the Saint Joseph's Hawk has been flapping its wings for over 50 years. Jim Brennan originated the idea for a hawk as mascot during the 1954-55 season. Brennan, an ex-Marine and SJU cheerleader, at first wanted to secure an actual hawk, but later switched to the costume idea. The student government raised the $120 needed to buy the initial costume, which Brennan donned for three years. He made his debut as the Hawk on January 4, 1956, at a 69-56 win over [[La Salle University]] at the Palestra.<ref name=\"The Hawk\">{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sjuhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208883426&DB_OEM_ID=31200|title=The Hawk|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawk is best known for staying in constant motion by flapping its wings throughout every basketball game, and for representing the Saint Joseph's motto, \"The Hawk Will Never Die\". It is also recognized by its \"flying\" in figure eights around the court during timeouts.<ref name=\"The Hawk\"/>\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main|Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball}}\n{{see also|Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Saint Joseph's-Temple rivalry|Philadelphia Big 5}}\n\nWhile Saint Joseph's fields 20 NCAA sports, the university's most popular sport is men's basketball. Saint Joseph's has a rich basketball tradition. Most home games are played at [[Hagan Arena]] on the school's campus, while some games are played at the [[Palestra]] on the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus.\n\nSaint Joseph's major rival is [[Villanova University]]. The rivalry is known as the [[Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Holy War]], although starting in 2013 both schools requested that the media refrain from using the term.<ref name=\"Holy War\">{{cite web |author=Mike Jensen|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-12-07/sports/44869008_1_army-navy-game-holy-war-basketball-game|title=Seeking an end to 'Holy War'|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> The school also maintains intense rivalries with the other Philadelphia universities.\n\nFans of the Hawks often chant \"The Hawk Will Never Die!\". Since the school's undefeated regular season, this chant has gained familiarity with the team's opponents. In 2003, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' listed that cheer among \"The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)\", calling it \"the most defiant cheer in college sports.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/sioncampus/09/24/100_things0930/|title=The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Athletic facilities===\n[[File:Finnessey.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Barbelin Hall & Finnesey Field]]\n*'''John Smithson Field''': Named after alum and former interim president John Smithson, the Hawks on-campus baseball field opened in 2012 on Maguire Campus. It features a synthetic surface with a dirt pitching mound and an AstroTurf 3D GameDay Grass surface. Bleacher seating capacity is 400 with much more space for standing room only.\n*'''SJU Softball Field''': The softball team opened their on-campus field in 2012. It features a turf outfield and bleacher seating for 400 spectators.\n*'''[[Gillin Boat Club|Robert Gillin Jr., Boathouse]]''': Saint Joseph's University celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2000'''[[Gillin Boat Club|2]]'''\u2013'''[[Gillin Boat Club|0]]'''01. In conjunction with that celebration, the SJU Rowing Progra, along with [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School|Saint Joseph's Pre]], kicked off a capital campaign to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art boathouse on the Schuylkill River. The boathouse provides a permanent home for the Hawk rowing programs. In addition, it provides the University with a significant presence on Kelly Drive. Named in honor of Robert Gillin Jr., groundbreaking for the facility took place in the fall of 2001. The total cost for the project was approximately $3 million, plus an endowment fund to support ongoing operational costs.\n*'''[[Sweeney Field]]''': Laid out in a natural bowl in the center of Saint Joseph's campus, Sweeney Field (formerly known as Finnesey Field) is the home field of Hawk soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey teams. Originally constructed for football and opened in 1929 with plans for an eventual 70,000-seat stadium, the field has undergone numerous changes over the years.\n*'''Tennis Complex at the Maguire Campus''': The tennis team moved to the six refurbished courts on the Maguire Campus in 2009 with the first SJU Invitational.\n*'''Finnesey Courts''': Adjacent to Sweeney Field stand the Finnesey Courts and home to the Hawk men's and women's tennis teams from the late 1940s until 2009. Prior to that SJU primarily played its home matches at the nearby Narberth courts. When courts were first built on campus, they were located where Bellarmine Hall now stands. Due to Bellarmine's construction in the summer of 1960, however, the Finnesey courts were torn down and rebuilt in their current location. These courts are still used by students.\n[[File:HaganArea 01.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Hagan Arena]]\n*'''[[Michael J. Hagan Arena]]''': The on-campus home of the Hawks basketball teams was originally named '''Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse''' for the Saint Joseph's graduates who gave their lives in [[World War II]]. The building was officially dedicated on November 11, 1949, and two weeks later played host to its first basketball game, a 62\u201346 loss to Rhode Island on November 26. Following that initial setback, SJU would go on to win the next 23 games in the friendly confines of the Fieldhouse. Overall, the Hawks have compiled an impressive 305\u201376 record (80.0 winning percentage) on Hawk Hill. Among the highlights of the Hawks' home court advantage was a 34-game winning streak from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, an 11\u20130 record in 2000\u201301, and the unbeaten 11\u20130 mark as the Hawks made their perfect season run in 2003\u201304. All told, SJU has had only two losing records in the Fieldhouse over 57 seasons. The Fieldhouse held 3,200 fans but the arena has a capacity of 4,200. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke at the Fieldhouse in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/facilities/stjs-facilities.html|title=SJU: Facilities|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref>\n*'''Ellen Ryan Field''': The Field Hockey team returned to campus after a multi-year hiatus with the addition of Ellen Ryan Field on the Maguire Campus in 2011. Ryan Field has a synthetic AstroTurf12 pitch and is situated adjacent to City Avenue.\n\nThe university also has a 240 by 120 four-court multi-purpose area for basketball, tennis, and volleyball, an indoor four-lane {{convert|200|yd|m|adj=on}} jogging track, an 8-lane 25-meter indoor pool with a 300-seat observation area, four racquetball courts, locker rooms and saunas, a large fitness center, and nine outdoor tennis courts.

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\nThe chickens live in a farm run by the Tweedys. They try to escape, but are always caught. Frustrated at the minuscule profits that the farm generates, Mrs. Tweedy conceives an idea of converting the farm to automated production and having a pie machine in the barn in order to turn the chickens into meat pies. One day, Ginger, the leader of the chickens, observes a rooster named Rocky crash-landing into the farm after being shot from a circus cannon. Ginger and the chickens hide him from the Tweedys. Ginger, interested in Rocky's flying abilities, begs him to help teach her and the chickens to fly. Rocky gives them training lessons in the meantime while Mr. Tweedy builds the pie machine. Later, Rocky holds a party and Ginger insists he show them to fly the next day, but Mr. Tweedy finishes making the pie machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves Ginger, giving them time to warn the others of the Tweedys' plan to make them into pies and only a short time for their escape.\n\nThe next day, Ginger finds Rocky has fled, leaving behind part of a poster that shows him to be a stunt rooster, shot out of a cannon from a circus and unable to fly himself, depressing Ginger and the others. Fowler the rooster tries to cheer them up by telling stories of being an RAF (Royal Air Force) division mascot, leading Ginger the idea of creating a plane to flee from the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mrs. Tweedy insists Mr. Tweedy gather all the chickens to put into the machine, but when he comes in, the chickens attack Mr. Tweedy, leaving him bound and gagged, as they finish the plane. Rocky returns and joins them, but while taking off, Mrs. Tweedy chases them and climbs up a strand while Ginger races to sever it, managing to cut the strand, sending Mrs. Tweedy into the pie machine, which causes it to explode. The chickens continue their flight to freedom, and find an island where they enjoy their freedom, and Ginger and Rocky start a relationship.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as Ginger, a hen who is determined to save her fellow chickens from their impending doom on the Tweedys' farm. She is usually the one that comes up with ideas and is generally more intelligent than the other chickens. \n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Rocky, a laid-back American circus rooster who crash-lands on the farm and teaches the chickens to fly at Ginger's request.\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Melisha Tweedy, a greedy and cantankerous lady who decides to convert her farm into a chicken pot pie factory solely for monetary reasons.\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Mr. Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's oafish, henpecked husband. Despite his unintelligence, he is cruel to the chickens and more suspicious than his wife of their escape plans, and he correctly identifies Ginger as their leader.\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as Fowler, a feisty elderly rooster who regularly prattles about his [[Royal Air Force]] experiences.\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Nick, a cynical, portly rat who smuggles contraband into the compound.\n* [[Phil Daniels]] as Fetcher, a rat who is Nick's slim, slow-witted partner.\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Babs, the fattest of the chickens. She is a stout hen with a dim-witted innocence and a love of knitting.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Bunty, the champion egg-layer and group cynic who is the most skeptical of Ginger's escape plans. \n* [[Lynn Ferguson]] as Mac, Ginger's genius [[Scottish people|Scottish]] assistant.\n\n==Production==\n''Chicken Run'' was [[Aardman Animations|Aardman]]'s first feature-length production, which would be executive produced by [[Jake Eberts]].

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\nThe chickens live in a farm run by the Tweedys. They try to escape, but are always caught. Frustrated at the minuscule profits that the farm generates, Mrs. Tweedy conceives an idea of converting the farm to automated production and having a pie machine in the barn in order to turn the chickens into meat pies. One day, Ginger, the leader of the chickens, observes a rooster named Rocky crash-landing into the farm after being shot from a circus cannon. Ginger and the chickens hide him from the Tweedys. Ginger, interested in Rocky's flying abilities, begs him to help teach her and the chickens to fly. Rocky gives them training lessons in the meantime while Mr. Tweedy builds the pie machine. Later, Rocky holds a party and Ginger insists he show them to fly the next day, but Mr. Tweedy finishes making the pie machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves Ginger, giving them time to warn the others of the Tweedys' plan to make them into pies and only a short time for their escape.\n\nThe next day, Ginger finds Rocky has fled, leaving behind part of a poster that shows him to be a stunt rooster, shot out of a cannon from a circus and unable to fly himself, depressing Ginger and the others. Fowler the rooster tries to cheer them up by telling stories of being an RAF (Royal Air Force) division mascot, leading Ginger the idea of creating a plane to flee from the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mrs. Tweedy insists Mr. Tweedy gather all the chickens to put into the machine, but when he comes in, the chickens attack Mr. Tweedy, leaving him bound and gagged, as they finish the plane. Rocky returns and joins them, but while taking off, Mrs. Tweedy chases them and climbs up a strand while Ginger races to sever it, managing to cut the strand, sending Mrs. Tweedy into the pie machine, which causes it to explode. The chickens continue their flight to freedom, and find an island where they enjoy their freedom, and Ginger and Rocky start a relationship.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as Ginger, a hen who is determined to save her fellow chickens from their impending doom on the Tweedys' farm. She is usually the one that comes up with ideas and is generally more intelligent than the other chickens. \n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Rocky, a laid-back American circus rooster who crash-lands on the farm and teaches the chickens to fly at Ginger's request.\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Tweedy, a greedy and cantankerous lady who decides to convert her farm into a chicken pot pie factory solely for monetary reasons.\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Mr. Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's oafish, henpecked husband. Despite his unintelligence, he is cruel to the chickens and more suspicious than his wife of their escape plans, and he correctly identifies Ginger as their leader.\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as Fowler, a feisty elderly rooster who regularly prattles about his [[Royal Air Force]] experiences.\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Nick, a cynical, portly rat who smuggles contraband into the compound.\n* [[Phil Daniels]] as Fetcher, a rat who is Nick's slim, slow-witted partner.\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Babs, the fattest of the chickens. She is a stout hen with a dim-witted innocence and a love of knitting.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Bunty, the champion egg-layer and group cynic who is the most skeptical of Ginger's escape plans. \n* [[Lynn Ferguson]] as Mac, Ginger's genius [[Scottish people|Scottish]] assistant.\n\n==Production==\n''Chicken Run'' was [[Aardman Animations|Aardman]]'s first feature-length production, which would be executive produced by [[Jake Eberts]].

This historic 40&nbsp;km journey commences at Gympie, and after crossing the Mary River, negotiates an abundance of curves, gradients and bridges to pass through the small country villages of [[Dagun, Queensland|Dagun]], [[Amamoor, Queensland|Amamoor]] and [[Kandanga, Queensland|Kandanga]] to [[Imbil, Queensland|Imbil]].\n\nThe steam train, a fully restored [[Queensland C17 class locomotive|C17 class]] locomotive from the early 1920s, departs Gympie station at 10 am. The Gympie Station itself dates back to pre-1880. As the train travels south, it passes through the southern end of the city of Gympie.\n\nAfter crossing the Mary River, the railway line enters the Mary Valley. The line wanders away from the river to negotiate the valleys of some of its main tributaries, including the Yabba, Kandanga and Amamoor Creeks. In this area there are a number of curves, gradients and bridges as you head towards the station of Kandanga.\n\nThe country village of Kandanga was established in 1910 to service patrons travelling on the proposed Mary Valley line which became operational as far as Kandanga in 1914. The original [[Kandanga railway station]], now restored to its former glory, contains an interesting pictorial record of the history of the Mary Valley line.\n\nTravelling through to Imbil, the line traverses an interesting gorge section through mainly timbered country, before reaching a short tunnel that pierces a ridge of coastal ranges. The track then descends quickly to the line's largest town, Imbil.   The Imbil Railway Bridge over Yabba Creek was constructed between 1911 and 1915.<ref name=\"ghs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qldheritage.org.au/heritage-ontrack-gympie.html |title=Gympie\u2019s heritage still on track |date=20 October 2011 |work=Media Release |publisher=Queensland Heritage Council |accessdate=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161248/http://www.qldheritage.org.au/heritage-ontrack-gympie.html |archivedate=2 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\n==Fleet==\n===Steam Locomotives===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Image\n!Year built\n!Builder\n!Status\n!Notes\n!Colours\n|-\n| C17 45<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%2045.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 45|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153705/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%2045.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1923\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Stored\n| Operational from 1996 until May 2003, now stored at Gympie.\n| QR Black and Red\n|-\n| C17 253<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20253.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No.253|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153615/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20253.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1921\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Undergoing Overhaul\n| Formerly at [[Mundubbera]], traded for 965 in 2003.\n| *dismantled*\n|-\n| C17 705<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20705.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No.705|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153344/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20705.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1926\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Stored\n| Formerly displayed at a preschool in [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] until 705 was purchased in 2009.\n| Apple Green and Red\n|-\n| C17 819<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20819.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 819|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718071554/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20819.htm|archive-date=18 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1927\n| [[Armstrong Whitworth]], Newcastle upon Tyne.\n| Undergoing Overhaul\n| Formerly displayed at [[Cloncurry]] until purchased in the 1990s as a second locomotive for MVHR. \n| *dismantled*\n|-\n| C17 967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20967.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 967|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120150/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20967.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1950\n| [[Walkers Limited]], Maryborough.\n| Operational\n| Currently the only operational locomotive at Mary Valley Heritage Railway after C17 802 was withdrawn in ~2011 or 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20802.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 802|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153438/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20802.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Was originally plinthed in a park at Caloundra.  967 was purchased in 1985 by the Ghan Preservation Society, Alice Springs, Northern Territory and exhibited as  'gatekeeper' at their site.

This historic 40&nbsp;km journey commences at Gympie, and after crossing the Mary River, negotiates an abundance of curves, gradients and bridges to pass through the small country villages of [[Dagun, Queensland|Dagun]], [[Amamoor, Queensland|Amamoor]] and [[Kandanga, Queensland|Kandanga]] to [[Imbil, Queensland|Imbil]].\n\nThe steam train, a fully restored [[Queensland C17 class locomotive|C17 class]] locomotive from the early 1920s, departs Gympie station at 10 am. The Gympie Station itself dates back to pre-1880. As the train travels south, it passes through the southern end of the city of Gympie.\n\nAfter crossing the Mary River, the railway line enters the Mary Valley. The line wanders away from the river to negotiate the valleys of some of its main tributaries, including the Yabba, Kandanga and Amamoor Creeks. In this area there are a number of curves, gradients and bridges as you head towards the station of Kandanga.\n\nThe country village of Kandanga was established in 1910 to service patrons travelling on the proposed Mary Valley line which became operational as far as Kandanga in 1914. The original [[Kandanga railway station]], now restored to its former glory, contains an interesting pictorial record of the history of the Mary Valley line.\n\nTravelling through to Imbil, the line traverses an interesting gorge section through mainly timbered country, before reaching a short tunnel that pierces a ridge of coastal ranges. The track then descends quickly to the line's largest town, Imbil.   The Imbil Railway Bridge over Yabba Creek was constructed between 1911 and 1915.<ref name=\"ghs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qldheritage.org.au/heritage-ontrack-gympie.html |title=Gympie\u2019s heritage still on track |date=20 October 2011 |work=Media Release |publisher=Queensland Heritage Council |accessdate=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161248/http://www.qldheritage.org.au/heritage-ontrack-gympie.html |archivedate=2 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\n==Fleet==\n===Steam Locomotives===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Image\n!Year built\n!Builder\n!Status\n!Notes\n!Colours\n|-\n| C17 45<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%2045.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 45|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153705/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%2045.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1923\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Stored\n| Operational from 1996 until May 2003, now stored at Gympie.\n| QR Black and Red\n|-\n| C17 253<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20253.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No.253|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153615/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20253.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1921\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Undergoing Overhaul\n| Formerly at [[Mundubbera]], traded for 965 in 2003.\n| *dismantled*\n|-\n| C17 705<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20705.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No.705|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153344/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20705.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1926\n| [[Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co|Evans Anderson Phelan]], Brisbane.\n| Stored\n| Formerly displayed at a preschool in [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] until 705 was purchased in 2009.\n| Apple Green and Red\n|-\n| C17 819<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20819.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 819|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718071554/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20819.htm|archive-date=18 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1927\n| [[Armstrong Whitworth]], Newcastle Upon Tyne.\n| Undergoing Overhaul\n| Formerly displayed at [[Cloncurry]] until purchased in the 1990s as a second locomotive for MVHR. \n| *dismantled*\n|-\n| C17 967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20967.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 967|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120150/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20967.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| \n| 1950\n| [[Walkers Limited]], Maryborough.\n| Operational\n| Currently the only operational locomotive at Mary Valley Heritage Railway after C17 802 was withdrawn in ~2011 or 2012 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20802.htm|title=Preserved Steam Locomotives Down Under - C17 No. 802|website=www.australiansteam.com|access-date=2019-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220153438/http://www.australiansteam.com/C17%20802.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>.

Typically, participants are not trained in [[yoga]], which results in humorous outcomes (awkward stances, falling down, etc.). These attempts are captured on film, usually on a smartphone or tablet camera, and uploaded to YouTube. Usually, prior to attempting a pose, participants will show an image of the correct pose they are attempting to the camera using a second phone or tablet (or by adding the image in during video editing). The contrast between correct poses by professionals and incorrect poses by amateurs adds to the humor. YouTuber [[Alfie Deyes]] posted a video titled ''The Yoga Challenge!'' in June 2014 which may have set off the trend. Deyes' video may have been inspired by various popular \"couples stunts\" and \"yoga fail\" videos by channels such as [[PrankvsPrank|BFvsGF]] posted as early as 2012.

Typically, participants are not trained in [[yoga]], which results in humorous outcomes (awkward stances, falling down, etc.). These attempts are captured on film, usually on a smartphone or tablet camera, and uploaded to YouTube. Usually, prior to attempting a pose, participants will show an image of the correct pose they are attempting to the camera using a second phone or tablet (or by adding the image in during video editing). The contrast between correct poses by professionals and incorrect poses by amateurs adds to the humor. YouTuber [[Alfie Deyes]] posted a video titled ''The Yoga Challenge!'' in June 2014 which may have set off the trend. Deyes' video may have been inspired by various popular \"couples stunts\" and \"yoga fail\" videos by channels such as [[PrankvsPrank|BFvsGF]] posted as early as 2012.
