With the military victory at Munda, and the deaths of [[Titus Labienus]] and [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]] (eldest son of [[Pompey]]), Caesar was politically able to return in triumph to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and then govern as the elected ''[[Roman dictator]]''. Subsequently, the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] began the Republican decline that led to the [[Roman Empire]], initiated with the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]].\n\n==Prelude==\nThe republicans had initially been led by [[Pompey]], until the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC and Pompey's death soon afterwards. However, in April 46 BC, Caesar's forces destroyed the Pompeian army at the [[Battle of Thapsus]].\n\nAfter this, military opposition to Caesar was confined to [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], comprising modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). During the Spring of 46 BC, two legions in [[Hispania Ulterior]], largely formed by former Pompeian veterans enrolled in Caesar's army, had declared themselves for Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great) and driven out Caesar's proconsul. Soon they were joined by the remnants of the Pompeian army. These forces were commanded by the brothers Gnaeus Pompeius and [[Sextus Pompeius|Sextus]] (sons of Pompey) and by the talented general [[Titus Labienus]], who had been one of the most trusted of Caesar's generals during the [[Gallic Wars]]. Using the resources of the province they were able to raise an army of three [[Roman legion|legions]]. These were the two original veteran legions, and one additional legion recruited from Roman citizens and local inhabitants in Hispania. They took control of almost all Hispania Ulterior, including the important Roman colonies of Italica and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Corduba]] (the capital of the province). Caesar's generals [[Quintus Fabius Maximus]] and [[Quintus Pedius]] did not risk a battle and remained encamped at Obulco (present-day [[Porcuna]]), about {{convert|35|mi|km}} east of Corduba, requesting help from Caesar.\n\n[[File:Caesar campaigns from Rome to Munda-fr.svg|thumb|350px|Caesar's campaign to Munda]]\nThus, Caesar was forced to move from Rome to Hispania to deal with the Pompeius brothers. He brought two trusted veteran legions ([[legio X Equestris|X ''Equestris'']] and [[legio V Alaudae|V ''Alaudae'']]) and some newer legions (including [[legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']] and [[legio VI Ferrata|VI ''Ferrata'']]), but in the main was forced to rely on the recruits already present in Hispania. Caesar covered the {{convert|1500|mi|km}} from [[Rome]] to Obulco in less than one month, arriving in early December (he immediately wrote a short poem, ''Iter'', describing this journey). Caesar had called for his great-nephew Octavian to join him, but due to his health Octavian was only able to reach him after the conclusion of the campaign.\n\nCapitalizing on his surprise arrival Caesar was able to relieve the stronghold of Ulipia (a town which had remained loyal to him and had been unsuccessfully besieged by Gnaeus Pompeius) but was unable to take Corduba, which was defended by Sextus Pompeius. Under Labienus\u2019 advice, Gnaeus Pompeius decided to avoid an open battle, and Caesar was forced to wage a winter campaign, while procuring food and shelter for his army. After a short siege, Caesar took the fortified city of Ategua; this was an important blow to the Pompeian confidence and morale, and some of the native allies started to desert to Caesar. Another skirmish near Soricaria on March 7 went in Caesar's favor; many Romans in the Pompeian camp began planning to defect and Gnaeus Pompeius  was forced to abandon his delaying tactics and offer battle.\n\n==Battle==\nThe two armies met in the plains of Munda in southern Spain. The Pompeian army was situated on a gentle hill, less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the walls of Munda, in a defensible position. Caesar led a total of eight legions (80 cohorts), with 8,000 horsemen, while Pompeius commanded thirteen legions, 6,000 light-infantrymen, and about 6,000 horsemen. Many of the Republican soldiers had already surrendered to Caesar in previous campaigns and had then deserted his army to rejoin Pompeius: they would fight with desperation, fearing that they would not be pardoned a second time (indeed Caesar had executed prisoners at his last major victory, at Thapsus). After an unsuccessful ploy designed to lure the Pompeians down the hill, Caesar ordered a frontal attack (with the watchword \"[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\", the goddess reputed to be his ancestor).\n\nThe fighting lasted for 8 hours without a clear advantage for either side, causing the generals to leave their commanding positions and join the ranks. As Caesar himself later said he had fought many times for victory, but at Munda he had to fight for his life.<ref>Appian, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#104 Civil Wars, 104]</ref> Caesar took command of his right wing, where his favorite [[Legio X Equestris]] was involved in heavy fighting. With Caesar's inspiration the tenth legion began to push back Pompeius' forces. Aware of the danger, Gnaeus Pompeius removed a legion from his own right wing to reinforce the threatened left wing. However, as soon as the Pompeian right wing was thus weakened, Caesar's cavalry launched a decisive attack which turned the course of the battle. King [[Bogud]] of [[Mauretania]] and his cavalry, Caesar's allies, attacked the rear of the Pompeian camp. Titus Labienus, commander of the Pompeian cavalry, saw this manoeuvre and moved some troops to intercept them.\n\nThe Pompeian army misinterpreted the situation. Already under heavy pressure on both the left (from Legio X) and right wings (the cavalry charge), they thought Labienus was retreating.<ref>Cassius Dio, Roman History . [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#38 43.38] \"Labienus, observing this, left his station and proceeded against him.  Pompey's men, then, supposing him to be in flight, lost heart; and though later, of course, they learned the truth, they could no longer recover themselves.\"</ref> The Pompeian legions broke their lines and fled in disorder. Although some were able to find refuge within the walls of Munda, many more were killed in the rout. At the end of the battle there were about 30,000 Pompeians dead on the field;<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/hisp.shtml#31 \"In quo proelio ceciderunt milia hominum circiter XXX\"], [[De Bello Hispaniensi]], 31 :\"About 30.000 men fell in the battle\"</ref> losses on Caesar's side were much lighter, only about 1,000.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/hisp.shtml#31 \"Nostri desiderati ad hominum mille partim peditum, partim equitum, saucii ad D\"], [[De Bello Hispaniensi]], 31: \"On our side we had about 1000 missing between infantry and cavalry, 500 wounded\"</ref> All thirteen standards of the Pompeian legions were captured, a sign of complete disbandment. Titus Labienus died on the field and was granted a burial by Caesar, while Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius managed to escape from the battlefield.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCaesar left his legate [[Quintus Fabius Maximus]] to besiege Munda and moved to pacify the province. Corduba surrendered: men in arms present in the town (mostly armed slaves) were executed and the city was forced to pay a heavy indemnity. The city of Munda held out for some time, but, after an unsuccessful attempt to break the siege, surrendered, with 14,000 prisoners taken. Gaius Didius, a naval commander loyal to Caesar, hunted down most of the Pompeian ships. [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]] looked for refuge on land, but was cornered during the [[Battle of Lauro]] and killed.\n\nAlthough Sextus Pompeius remained at large, after Munda there were no more conservative armies challenging Caesar's dominion. Upon his return to Rome, according to [[Plutarch]], the \"triumph which he celebrated for this victory displeased the Romans beyond any thing. For he had not defeated foreign generals, or barbarian kings, but had destroyed the children and family of one of the greatest men of Rome.\" Caesar was made dictator for life, though his success was short-lived; Caesar was murdered on March 15 of the following year (44 BC) by the next generation of statesmen, led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]].\n\n==Localization==\nThe exact location of Munda has long been a matter of debate.\n\nSome Spanish historians<ref>E.g. Rafael Atienzas Huertas, 1857</ref> asserted that Munda was the Roman name for modern-day [[Ronda]], where the battle of Munda may have been fought. Other early researchers localized the battle in various other places, e.g. near [[Monda]] or [[Montilla]], the latter having been proposed on the basis of on an earlier localization attempt that was only meant to honor a member of the French royal house, who was born in Montilla.<ref>The encyclopedia [[Realencyclop\u00e4die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft|''Der Neue Pauly'']] still mentions Montilla as a probable location.</ref>\n\nIt is a matter of civic pride in Montilla that the Battle of Munda was (according to them) fought nearby, and at the outset of Hispanist [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]]'s novella [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], source of [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera, the narrator clearly states that his research indicates that Munda was near Montilla (no reference to either Munda or Montilla is found in Bizet's opera).\n\nOther experts have asserted that Munda was fought just outside [[Osuna]], in the province of Seville. This was supported by ancient slingshot bullets that were excavated near [[La Lantejuela]], halfway between [[Osuna]] and [[\u00c9cija]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Gr\u00fcnewald |first2=Alexandra |last2=Richter |title=Zeugen Caesars schwerster Schlacht?

As Caesar himself later said he had fought many times for victory, but at Munda he had to fight for his life.<ref>Appian, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#104 Civil Wars, 104]</ref> Caesar took command of his right wing, where his favorite [[Legio X Equestris]] was involved in heavy fighting. With Caesar's inspiration the tenth legion began to push back Pompeius' forces. Aware of the danger, Gnaeus Pompeius removed a legion from his own right wing to reinforce the threatened left wing. However, as soon as the Pompeian right wing was thus weakened, Caesar's cavalry launched a decisive attack which turned the course of the battle. King [[Bogud]] of [[Mauretania]] and his cavalry, Caesar's allies, attacked the rear of the Pompeian camp. Titus Labienus, commander of the Pompeian cavalry, saw this manoeuvre and moved some troops to intercept them.\n\nThe Pompeian army misinterpreted the situation. Already under heavy pressure on both the left (from Legio X) and right wings (the cavalry charge), they thought Labienus was retreating.<ref>Cassius Dio, Roman History . [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#38 43.38] \"Labienus, observing this, left his station and proceeded against him.  Pompey's men, then, supposing him to be in flight, lost heart; and though later, of course, they learned the truth, they could no longer recover themselves.\"</ref> The Pompeian legions broke their lines and fled in disorder. Although some were able to find refuge within the walls of Munda, many more were killed in the rout. At the end of the battle there were about 30,000 Pompeians dead on the field;<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/hisp.shtml#31 \"In quo proelio ceciderunt milia hominum circiter XXX\"], [[De Bello Hispaniensi]], 31 :\"About 30.000 men fell in the battle\"</ref> losses on Caesar's side were much lighter, only about 1,000.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/hisp.shtml#31 \"Nostri desiderati ad hominum mille partim peditum, partim equitum, saucii ad D\"], [[De Bello Hispaniensi]], 31: \"On our side we had about 1000 missing between infantry and cavalry, 500 wounded\"</ref> All thirteen standards of the Pompeian legions were captured, a sign of complete disbandment. Titus Labienus died on the field and was granted a burial by Caesar, while Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius managed to escape from the battlefield.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCaesar left his legate [[Quintus Fabius Maximus]] to besiege Munda and moved to pacify the province. Corduba surrendered: men in arms present in the town (mostly armed slaves) were executed and the city was forced to pay a heavy indemnity. The city of Munda held out for some time, but, after an unsuccessful attempt to break the siege, surrendered, with 14,000 prisoners taken. Gaius Didius, a naval commander loyal to Caesar, hunted down most of the Pompeian ships. [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]] looked for refuge on land, but was cornered during the [[Battle of Lauro]] and killed.\n\nAlthough Sextus Pompeius remained at large, after Munda there were no more conservative armies challenging Caesar's dominion. Upon his return to Rome, according to [[Plutarch]], the \"triumph which he celebrated for this victory displeased the Romans beyond any thing. For he had not defeated foreign generals, or barbarian kings, but had destroyed the children and family of one of the greatest men of Rome.\" Caesar was made dictator for life, though his success was short-lived; Caesar was murdered on March 15 of the following year (44 BC) by the next generation of statesmen, led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]].\n\n==Localization==\nThe exact location of Munda has long been a matter of debate.\n\nSome Spanish historians<ref>E.g. Rafael Atienzas Huertas, 1857</ref> asserted that Munda was the Roman name for modern-day [[Ronda]], where the battle of Munda may have been fought. Other early researchers localized the battle in various other places, e.g. near [[Monda]] or [[Montilla]], the latter having been proposed on the basis of on an earlier localization attempt that was only meant to honor a member of the French royal house, who was born in Montilla.<ref>The encyclopedia [[Realencyclop\u00e4die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft|''Der Neue Pauly'']] still mentions Montilla as a probable location.</ref>\n\nIt is a matter of civic pride in Montilla that the Battle of Munda was (according to them) fought nearby, and at the outset of Hispanist [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]]'s novella [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], source of [[George Bizet]]'s opera, the narrator clearly states that his research indicates that Munda was near Montilla (no reference to either Munda or Montilla is found in Bizet's opera).\n\nOther experts have asserted that Munda was fought just outside [[Osuna]], in the province of Seville. This was supported by ancient slingshot bullets that were excavated near [[La Lantejuela]], halfway between [[Osuna]] and [[\u00c9cija]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Gr\u00fcnewald |first2=Alexandra |last2=Richter |title=Zeugen Caesars schwerster Schlacht?

She is an [[archetype]] of literature and art. Her ability to enchant, entice and hypnotize her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as being literally supernatural; hence, the femme fatale today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, witch, having power over men.\n\nIn Virginia Allen's opinion, one of the most common traits of the femme fatale includes promiscuity and the \"rejection of motherhood\", seen as \"one of her most threatening qualities since by denying his immortality and his posterity it leads to the ultimate destruction of the male\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Susan|date=2015|title=Images of the Femme Fatale in two Short Stories by Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=06ca45e7-6d8e-4a8f-8380-b2483dd20c99%40sessionmgr114&vid=3&hid=104|journal=Romance Notes|doi=|pmid=|access-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> Femmes fatales are typically villainous, or at least morally ambiguous, and always associated with a sense of mystification, and unease.<ref name=\":0\">Mary Ann Doane, ''Femme Fatales'' (1991) pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\nIn American early 20th century films, ''femme fatale'' characters were referred to as '''vamps''', in reference to [[Theda Bara]], who played a seductive woman referred to as a \"[[vampire]]\" in the 1915 film [[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|''A Fool There Was'']].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Mondo Exotica: Sounds, Visions, Obsessions of the Cocktail Generation|last=Adinolfi|first=Francesco|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=9780822341321|location=Durham|page=24|pages=|translator-last=Pinkus|translator-first=Karen|oclc=179838406|translator-last2=Vivrette|translator-first2=Jason}}</ref> Many female mobsters (especially members of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] or [[Russian Mafia]]) have been known to be femme fatales in many films noir as well as [[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]] films.\n\nThe phrase is French for \"fatal woman\". A femme fatale tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, or sexual allure. In many cases, her attitude towards sexuality is lackadaisical, intriguing, or frivolous. In some cases, she uses [[lie]]s or [[coercion]] rather than charm. She may also make use of some subduing weapon such as [[sleeping gas]], a modern analog of magical powers in older tales. She may also be (or imply that she is) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape; ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (a 1947 [[film noir]]) is one such example. A younger or [[Age of consent|underage]] version of a femme fatale is called a '''fille fatale''', or \"fatal girl\".\n\n==History==\n===Ancient archetypes===\n[[File:Wood carving detail2 - Vishnu Mohini.jpg|right|thumb|The divine femme fatale of Hindu mythology, [[Mohini]] is described to have enchanted gods, demons and sages alike.]]\n\nThe femme fatale [[archetype]] exists in the culture, [[folklore]] and myths of many cultures.<ref>Mario Praz, ''The Romantic Agony'', ch.

The pre-medieval inherited Biblical figure of [[Eve]] offers an example, as does the wicked, seductive enchantress typified in [[Morgan le Fay]]. The Queen of the Night in Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' shows her more muted presence during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]<ref>C. G. Jung ed, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 187</ref>\n\nThe ''femme fatale'' flourished in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period in the works of [[John Keats]], notably \"[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]\" and \"[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]\". Along with them, there rose the [[gothic novel]] ''[[The Monk]]'' featuring Matilda, a very powerful femme fatale. This led to her appearing in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and as the [[vampire]], notably in ''[[Carmilla]]'' and ''[[Brides of Dracula]]''. ''The Monk'' was greatly admired by the [[Marquis de Sade]], for whom the femme fatale symbolised not evil, but all the best qualities of women; his novel ''[[L'Histoire de Juliette|Juliette]]'' is perhaps the earliest wherein the femme fatale triumphs. [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters frequently used the classic personifications of the femme fatale as a subject.\n\nIn the Western culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the ''femme fatale'' became a more fashionable [[Trope (literature)|trope]],<ref>Jill Scott, ''Electra after Freud'' (2005) p. 66</ref> and she is found in the paintings of the artists [[Edvard Munch]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Franz von Stuck]] and [[Gustave Moreau]]. The novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] includes these fevered imaginings about an image of Salome in a Moreau painting:<ref>Huysmans ''\u00c0 rebours'' \u2013 Toni Bentley (2002) ''Sisters of Salome'': 24</ref>\n\n{{bq|1=No longer was she merely the dancing-girl who extorts a cry of lust and concupiscence from an old man by the lascivious contortions of her body; who breaks the will, masters the mind of a King by the spectacle of her quivering bosoms, heaving belly and tossing thighs; she was now revealed in a sense as the symbolic incarnation of world-old Vice, the goddess of immortal Hysteria, the Curse of Beauty supreme above all other beauties by the cataleptic spasm that stirs her flesh and steels her muscles, \u2013 a monstrous Beast of the Apocalypse, indifferent, irresponsible, insensible, poisoning.|sign=[[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]|source=''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'', ''Sisters of Salome''}}\n\nShe also is seen as a prominent figure in late nineteenth and twentieth century opera, appearing in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' ([[Kundry]]), [[Georges Bizet]]'s \"[[Carmen]]\", [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' \"[[Samson et Delilah]]\" and [[Alban Berg]]'s \"[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]\" (based on the plays \"[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]\" and \"[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora]]\" by [[Frank Wedekind]]).\n\nIn [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] decadence, [[Oscar Wilde]] reinvented the femme fatale in the play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'': she manipulates her lust-crazed uncle, King Herod, with her enticing [[Dance of the Seven Veils]] (Wilde's invention) to agree to her imperious demand: \"bring me the head of [[John the Baptist]]\". Later, Salome was the subject of an opera by Strauss, and was popularized on stage, screen, and peep-show booth in countless reincarnations.<ref>Toni Bentley (2002) ''Sisters of Salome''</ref>\n\nAnother enduring icon of glamour, seduction, and moral turpitude is Margaretha Geertruida Zelle. While working as an exotic dancer, she took the stage name [[Mata Hari]]. She was accused of German espionage and was put to death by a French firing squad. After her death she became the subject of many sensational films and books.\n\nOther considerably famous ''femmes fatales'' are [[Isabella of France]], [[Hedda Gabler]] of Kristiania (now Oslo), [[Marie Antoinette]] of Austria, and, most famously, [[Lucrezia Borgia]].\n\n{{anchor|vamp}}\n\n===20th-century genres===\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Alice-hollister.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Hollister]], the \"original vampire\"<ref name=Kalem/> of the screen]]\n[[File:Thedarose.jpg|thumb|Actress [[Theda Bara]] defined the word \"Vamp\" in the film ''[[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|A Fool There Was]]''.]]\n\nOne traditional view portrays the femme fatale as a sexual [[vampire]]; her charms leech the virility and independence of lovers, leaving them shells of themselves. [[Rudyard Kipling]] took inspiration from a vampire painted by [[Philip Burne-Jones]], an image typical of the era{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} in 1897, to write his poem \"The Vampire\".

The poem was used in the publicity for the film.{{cn|date=September 2019}} On this account, in the [[American English|American]] [[slang]] of the era the ''femme fatale'' was called a ''vamp'', short for ''vampire''.<ref>Per the Oxford English Dictionary, ''vamp'' is originally English, used first by [[G.

At the end of that decade, the French-Canadian villainess [[Marie de Sabrevois]] gave a contemporary edge to the otherwise very historical novels of [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]] set during the [[American Revolution|war for U.S. independence]].\n\nFor film audiences, too, the villainess often appeared foreign, usually either of indeterminate Eastern European or Asian ancestry. She was the sexual counterpart to wholesome actresses such as [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Mary Pickford]]. Notable silent-cinema vamps included Theda Bara, [[Helen Gardner (actress)|Helen Gardner]], [[Louise Glaum]], [[Valeska Suratt]], [[Musidora]], [[Virginia Pearson]], [[Olga Petrova]], [[Rosemary Theby]], [[Nita Naldi]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Estelle Taylor]], [[Jetta Goudal]], and, in early appearances, [[Myrna Loy]].\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 14.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The story \"Temptress of the Tower of Torture and Sin\" is illustrated on the cover of the ''Avon Fantasy Reader''.]]\n\nDuring the [[film-noir]] era of the 1940s and early-1950s, the femme fatale flourished in American cinema.

Another frequently cited example is the character Jane played by [[Lizabeth Scott]] in ''[[Too Late for Tears]]'' ([[1949 in film|1949]]); during her quest to keep some dirty money from its rightful recipient and her husband, she uses poison, lies, sexual teasing and a gun to keep men wrapped around her finger. [[Jane Greer]] remains notable as a murderous femme fatale using her wiles on [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' ([[1947 in film|1947]]). In Hitchcock's [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film]] and Daphne du Maurier's [[Rebecca (novel)|1938 novel]] ''Rebecca'', the eponymous femme fatale completely dominates the plot, even though she is already dead and we never see an image of her. ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends (TV series)|Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'''s Natasha Fatale, a curvaceous spy, takes her name from the ''femme fatale'' stock character.\n\nThe femme fatale has carried on to the present day, in films such as ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981) and ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' (1985) \u2013 both with [[Kathleen Turner]], ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) with [[Sean Young]], ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) with [[Isabella Rossellini]],  ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987) with [[Glenn Close]], ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) with [[Sharon Stone]], ''[[Damage (1992 film)|Damage]]'' (1992) with [[Juliette Binoche]]'', [[The Last Seduction]]'' (1994) with [[Linda Fiorentino]], ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995) with [[Nicole Kidman]], ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) with [[Patricia Arquette]], ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998) with [[Wendee Lee]], ''[[Devil in the Flesh (1998 film)|Devil in the Flesh]]'' (1998) and ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]'' (1999), both with [[Rose McGowan]], ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' (2001) with [[Angelina Jolie]], ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2002) with [[Rebecca Romijn]], and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009), with [[Megan Fox]]. In 2013, [[Tania Raymonde]] played the title role in ''[[Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret]]''. In 2014, [[Eva Green]] portrayed a [[Ava Lord|femme fatale]] in ''[[Sin City: A Dame to Kill For]]'' and [[Rosamund Pike]] starred in ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actress [[Marion Cotillard]] has frequently played femmes fatales, in such films as ''A Private Affair'' (2002), ''[[A Very Long Engagement]]'', ''[[La Bo\u00eete noire|The Black Box]]'', ''[[Inception]]'', ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' and ''[[Macbeth (2015 film)|Macbeth]]''. [[Nicole Kidman]] has also played a few femmes fatales in films as ''[[To Die For]]'', ''[[The Paperboy (2012 film)|The Paperboy]]'' and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''.\n\nThe archetype is also abundantly found in American television. One of the most famous femmes fatales of American television is [[Sherilyn Fenn]]'s [[Audrey Horne]] of the [[David Lynch]] cult series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''. In the late night [[Cinemax]] TV series, [[Femme Fatales (TV series)|''Femme Fatales'']], actress [[Tanit Phoenix]] plays [[Lilith]], the host who introduces each episode [[Rod Serling]]-style and occasionally appears within the narrative. In the [[Netflix]] TV series, ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', actress [[Laura Prepon]] plays [[Alex Vause]], a modern femme fatale, leading both men and women to their destruction.\n\nFemmes fatales also appear frequently in comic books.

She is an [[archetype]] of literature and art. Her ability to enchant, entice and hypnotize her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as being literally supernatural; hence, the femme fatale today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, witch, having power over men.\n\nIn Virginia Allen's opinion, one of the most common traits of the femme fatale includes promiscuity and the \"rejection of motherhood\", seen as \"one of her most threatening qualities since by denying his immortality and his posterity it leads to the ultimate destruction of the male\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Susan|date=2015|title=Images of the Femme Fatale in two Short Stories by Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=06ca45e7-6d8e-4a8f-8380-b2483dd20c99%40sessionmgr114&vid=3&hid=104|journal=Romance Notes|doi=|pmid=|access-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> Femmes fatales are typically villainous, or at least morally ambiguous, and always associated with a sense of mystification, and unease.<ref name=\":0\">Mary Ann Doane, ''Femme Fatales'' (1991) pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\nIn American early 20th century films, ''femme fatale'' characters were referred to as '''vamps''', in reference to [[Theda Bara]], who played a seductive woman referred to as a \"[[vampire]]\" in the 1915 film [[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|''A Fool There Was'']].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Mondo Exotica: Sounds, Visions, Obsessions of the Cocktail Generation|last=Adinolfi|first=Francesco|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=9780822341321|location=Durham|page=24|pages=|translator-last=Pinkus|translator-first=Karen|oclc=179838406|translator-last2=Vivrette|translator-first2=Jason}}</ref> Many female mobsters (especially members of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] or [[Russian Mafia]]) have been known to be femme fatales in many films noir as well as [[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]] films.\n\nThe phrase is French for \"fatal woman\". A femme fatale tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, or sexual allure. In many cases, her attitude towards sexuality is lackadaisical, intriguing, or frivolous. In some cases, she uses [[lie]]s or [[coercion]] rather than charm. She may also make use of some subduing weapon such as [[sleeping gas]], a modern analog of magical powers in older tales. She may also be (or imply that she is) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape; ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (a 1947 [[film noir]]) is one such example. A younger or [[Age of consent|underage]] version of a femme fatale is called a '''fille fatale''', or \"fatal girl\".\n\n==History==\n===Ancient archetypes===\n[[File:Wood carving detail2 - Vishnu Mohini.jpg|right|thumb|The divine femme fatale of Hindu mythology, [[Mohini]] is described to have enchanted gods, demons and sages alike.]]\n\nThe femme fatale [[archetype]] exists in the culture, [[folklore]] and myths of many cultures.<ref>Mario Praz, ''The Romantic Agony'', ch.

The pre-medieval inherited Biblical figure of [[Eve]] offers an example, as does the wicked, seductive enchantress typified in [[Morgan le Fay]]. The Queen of the Night in Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' shows her more muted presence during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]<ref>C. G. Jung ed, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 187</ref>\n\nThe ''femme fatale'' flourished in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period in the works of [[John Keats]], notably \"[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]\" and \"[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]\". Along with them, there rose the [[gothic novel]] ''[[The Monk]]'' featuring Matilda, a very powerful femme fatale. This led to her appearing in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and as the [[vampire]], notably in ''[[Carmilla]]'' and ''[[Brides of Dracula]]''. ''The Monk'' was greatly admired by the [[Marquis de Sade]], for whom the femme fatale symbolised not evil, but all the best qualities of women; his novel ''[[L'Histoire de Juliette|Juliette]]'' is perhaps the earliest wherein the femme fatale triumphs. [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters frequently used the classic personifications of the femme fatale as a subject.\n\nIn the Western culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the ''femme fatale'' became a more fashionable [[Trope (literature)|trope]],<ref>Jill Scott, ''Electra after Freud'' (2005) p. 66</ref> and she is found in the paintings of the artists [[Edvard Munch]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Franz von Stuck]] and [[Gustave Moreau]]. The novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] includes these fevered imaginings about an image of Salome in a Moreau painting:<ref>Huysmans ''\u00c0 rebours'' \u2013 Toni Bentley (2002) ''Sisters of Salome'': 24</ref>\n\n{{bq|1=No longer was she merely the dancing-girl who extorts a cry of lust and concupiscence from an old man by the lascivious contortions of her body; who breaks the will, masters the mind of a King by the spectacle of her quivering bosoms, heaving belly and tossing thighs; she was now revealed in a sense as the symbolic incarnation of world-old Vice, the goddess of immortal Hysteria, the Curse of Beauty supreme above all other beauties by the cataleptic spasm that stirs her flesh and steels her muscles, \u2013 a monstrous Beast of the Apocalypse, indifferent, irresponsible, insensible, poisoning.|sign=[[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]|source=''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'', ''Sisters of Salome''}}\n\nShe also is seen as a prominent figure in late nineteenth and twentieth century opera, appearing in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' ([[Kundry]]), [[George Bizet]]'s \"[[Carmen]]\", [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' \"[[Samson et Delilah]]\" and [[Alban Berg]]'s \"[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]\" (based on the plays \"[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]\" and \"[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora]]\" by [[Frank Wedekind]]).\n\nIn [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] decadence, [[Oscar Wilde]] reinvented the femme fatale in the play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'': she manipulates her lust-crazed uncle, King Herod, with her enticing [[Dance of the Seven Veils]] (Wilde's invention) to agree to her imperious demand: \"bring me the head of [[John the Baptist]]\". Later, Salome was the subject of an opera by Strauss, and was popularized on stage, screen, and peep-show booth in countless reincarnations.<ref>Toni Bentley (2002) ''Sisters of Salome''</ref>\n\nAnother enduring icon of glamour, seduction, and moral turpitude is Margaretha Geertruida Zelle. While working as an exotic dancer, she took the stage name [[Mata Hari]]. She was accused of German espionage and was put to death by a French firing squad. After her death she became the subject of many sensational films and books.\n\nOther considerably famous ''femmes fatales'' are [[Isabella of France]], [[Hedda Gabler]] of Kristiania (now Oslo), [[Marie Antoinette]] of Austria, and, most famously, [[Lucrezia Borgia]].\n\n{{anchor|vamp}}\n\n===20th-century genres===\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Alice-hollister.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Hollister]], the \"original vampire\"<ref name=Kalem/> of the screen]]\n[[File:Thedarose.jpg|thumb|Actress [[Theda Bara]] defined the word \"Vamp\" in the film ''[[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|A Fool There Was]]''.]]\n\nOne traditional view portrays the femme fatale as a sexual [[vampire]]; her charms leech the virility and independence of lovers, leaving them shells of themselves. [[Rudyard Kipling]] took inspiration from a vampire painted by [[Philip Burne-Jones]], an image typical of the era{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} in 1897, to write his poem \"The Vampire\". The poem inspired the 1913 [[eponymous]] film ''[[The Vampire (1913 film)|The Vampire]]'' by [[Robert Vignola]], sometimes cited as the first \"vamp\" movie.<ref>John T.

The poem was used in the publicity for the film.{{cn|date=September 2019}} On this account, in the [[American English|American]] [[slang]] of the era the ''femme fatale'' was called a ''vamp'', short for ''vampire''.<ref>Per the Oxford English Dictionary, ''vamp'' is originally English, used first by [[G.

At the end of that decade, the French-Canadian villainess [[Marie de Sabrevois]] gave a contemporary edge to the otherwise very historical novels of [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]] set during the [[American Revolution|war for U.S. independence]].\n\nFor film audiences, too, the villainess often appeared foreign, usually either of indeterminate Eastern European or Asian ancestry. She was the sexual counterpart to wholesome actresses such as [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Mary Pickford]]. Notable silent-cinema vamps included Theda Bara, [[Helen Gardner (actress)|Helen Gardner]], [[Louise Glaum]], [[Valeska Suratt]], [[Musidora]], [[Virginia Pearson]], [[Olga Petrova]], [[Rosemary Theby]], [[Nita Naldi]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Estelle Taylor]], [[Jetta Goudal]], and, in early appearances, [[Myrna Loy]].\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 14.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The story \"Temptress of the Tower of Torture and Sin\" is illustrated on the cover of the ''Avon Fantasy Reader''.]]\n\nDuring the [[film-noir]] era of the 1940s and early-1950s, the femme fatale flourished in American cinema. Examples include Brigid O'Shaughnessy, portrayed by [[Mary Astor]], who murders Sam Spade's partner in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' ([[1941 in film|1941]]); manipulative narcissistic daughter Veda (portrayed by [[Ann Blyth]]) in [[Mildred Pierce (1945 film)|''Mildred Pierce'']] who exploits her indulgent mother Mildred (portrayed by [[Joan Crawford]]) and fatally destroys her mother's remarriage to stepfather Monte Barragon (portrayed by [[Zachary Scott]]); [[Gene Tierney]] as Ellen Brent Harland in ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]), and the cabaret singer portrayed by [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Gilda]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]),<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|last=Johnston |first=Sheila |title=Whatever happened to the femme fatale? |publisher=The Independent |date=27 February 2009 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/whatever-happened-to-the-femme-fatale-1633088.html |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228103849/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/whatever-happened-to-the-femme-fatale-1633088.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}</ref> narcissistic wives who manipulate their husbands; [[Phyllis Dietrichson]] ([[Barbara Stanwyck]]) in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]), [[Ava Gardner]] in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' and Cora ([[Lana Turner]]) in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', based on novels by [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[James M. Cain]] respectively, manipulate men into killing their husbands.<ref name=Independent/>\n\nIn the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] film ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' ([[1947 in film|1947]]), [[Alida Valli]]'s character causes the deaths of two men and the near destruction of another. Another frequently cited example is the character Jane played by [[Lizabeth Scott]] in ''[[Too Late for Tears]]'' ([[1949 in film|1949]]); during her quest to keep some dirty money from its rightful recipient and her husband, she uses poison, lies, sexual teasing and a gun to keep men wrapped around her finger. [[Jane Greer]] remains notable as a murderous femme fatale using her wiles on [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' ([[1947 in film|1947]]). In Hitchcock's [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film]] and Daphne du Maurier's [[Rebecca (novel)|1938 novel]] ''Rebecca'', the eponymous femme fatale completely dominates the plot, even though she is already dead and we never see an image of her. ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends (TV series)|Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'''s Natasha Fatale, a curvaceous spy, takes her name from the ''femme fatale'' stock character.\n\nThe femme fatale has carried on to the present day, in films such as ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981) and ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' (1985) \u2013 both with [[Kathleen Turner]], ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) with [[Sean Young]], ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) with [[Isabella Rossellini]],  ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987) with [[Glenn Close]], ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) with [[Sharon Stone]], ''[[Damage (1992 film)|Damage]]'' (1992) with [[Juliette Binoche]]'', [[The Last Seduction]]'' (1994) with [[Linda Fiorentino]], ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995) with [[Nicole Kidman]], ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) with [[Patricia Arquette]], ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998) with [[Wendee Lee]], ''[[Devil in the Flesh (1998 film)|Devil in the Flesh]]'' (1998) and ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]'' (1999), both with [[Rose McGowan]], ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' (2001) with [[Angelina Jolie]], ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2002) with [[Rebecca Romijn]], and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009), with [[Megan Fox]]. In 2013, [[Tania Raymonde]] played the title role in ''[[Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret]]''. In 2014, [[Eva Green]] portrayed a [[Ava Lord|femme fatale]] in ''[[Sin City: A Dame to Kill For]]'' and [[Rosamund Pike]] starred in ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actress [[Marion Cotillard]] has frequently played femmes fatales, in such films as ''A Private Affair'' (2002), ''[[A Very Long Engagement]]'', ''[[La Bo\u00eete noire|The Black Box]]'', ''[[Inception]]'', ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' and ''[[Macbeth (2015 film)|Macbeth]]''. [[Nicole Kidman]] has also played a few femmes fatales in films as ''[[To Die For]]'', ''[[The Paperboy (2012 film)|The Paperboy]]'' and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''.\n\nThe archetype is also abundantly found in American television. One of the most famous femmes fatales of American television is [[Sherilyn Fenn]]'s [[Audrey Horne]] of the [[David Lynch]] cult series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''. In the late night [[Cinemax]] TV series, [[Femme Fatales (TV series)|''Femme Fatales'']], actress [[Tanit Phoenix]] plays [[Lilith]], the host who introduces each episode [[Rod Serling]]-style and occasionally appears within the narrative. In the [[Netflix]] TV series, ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', actress [[Laura Prepon]] plays [[Alex Vause]], a modern femme fatale, leading both men and women to their destruction.\n\nFemmes fatales also appear frequently in comic books. Notable examples include [[Batman]]'s long-time nemesis [[Catwoman]], who first appeared in comics in 1940, and various adversaries of [[The Spirit]], such as [[P'Gell]].\n\nThis stock character is also often found in the genres of opera and musical theatre, where she will traditionally have a [[Mezzo-soprano|mezzo]], [[alto]] or [[contralto]] range, opposed to the [[ing\u00e9nue]]\u2019s [[soprano]], to symbolise the masculinity and lack of feminine purity.

After a lengthy investigation, it was determined that another negative existed in [[East Germany]] and it was used it to make prints that were dubbed in Arabic and distributed in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the [[Stasi]] or the [[KGB]] in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet backed Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]).<ref name=\"Hull1973\">{{cite book|last=Hull|first=David Stewart |title=Film in the Third Reich; art and propaganda in Nazi Germany|url=https://archive.org/details/film3rdreichp00davi|url-access=registration|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen |title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GZZAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0-89356-247-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Berkeley1960\">{{cite book|author=University of California, Berkeley|title=Film quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8UAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1960|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> The copyright of the film is held by the government-owned [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation|F.W.

However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film.

Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the [[Stasi]] or the [[KGB]] in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet backed Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]).<ref name=\"Hull1973\">{{cite book|last=Hull|first=David Stewart |title=Film in the Third Reich; art and propaganda in Nazi Germany|url=https://archive.org/details/film3rdreichp00davi|url-access=registration|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen |title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GZZAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0-89356-247-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Berkeley1960\">{{cite book|author=University of California, Berkeley|title=Film quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8UAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1960|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> The copyright of the film is held by the government-owned [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation|F.W.

This was not because of the alleged copycat violence inspired by the film contemporaneously reported by the media, as commonly believed,{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} but because Kubrick had received death threats against his family.

At first, it was screened in theaters all over the United Kingdom and was a grossing hit. However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film. Eventually, the pseudo ban was lifted in 1991 because it was believed the film no longer had the gruesome impact it once did. <ref>https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/exorcist</ref>\n|}\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|List of films banned in the United States}}\n\n==Venezuela==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The instruments of such an orchestra are most often the following:  the [[violin]], which is divided into first and second violin players (each usually playing different parts), the [[viola]], the [[cello]], and usually, but not always, the [[double bass]].\n\nString orchestras can be of chamber orchestra size ranging from between 12 (4 first violins, 3 second violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos and 1 bass = 12) and 21 musicians (6 first violins, 5 second violins, 4 violas, 4 cellos and 2 double basses= 21) sometimes performing without a [[Conducting|conductor]]. It could also consist of the entire string section of a large symphony orchestra which could have 60 musicians (16 first violins, 14 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos and 8 double basses = 60; ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' calls for 84: 20.20.16.16.12).<ref name=\"CarnicerMisol2008\">{{cite book|author1=Josep Gustems Carnicer|author2=Edmon Elgstr\u00f6m Misol|title=Gu\u00eda pr\u00e1ctica para la direcci\u00f3n de grupos vocales e instrumentales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIwVi5HJMcEC&pg=PA32|year=2008|publisher=Grao|isbn=978-84-7827-643-1|pages=32\u201334|language=es}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\n{{listen\n|filename = Serenade for Strings -mvt-1- Elgar.ogg\n|title = Serenade for Strings (Op. 20, mv 1)\n|description = [[Edward Elgar]]'s \"[[Serenade for Strings (Elgar)|Serenade for Strings]], movement 1\" performed by the [[United States Army Band]] Strings ensemble\n}}\nThe repertoire includes several works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (including ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]''), [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]] (his eight symphonies are for strings only), and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] which dispense with the baroque [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. Some of these works are problematic when it comes to deciding whether they are for orchestra or [[string quartet]]. Particularly in Haydn's early works it is argued that the inversions of harmony from the occasional crossings of the bass and viola line imply a double bass; the question is not settled, however.\n\nImportant 20th century works have been written for string orchestra by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] ([[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]]), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] (''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]''), [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]] (''[[Musique fun\u00e8bre]]''), [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Simple Symphony]]'' and ''[[Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge]]''), [[Charles Wuorinen]] (''Grand Bamboula''), and [[Malcolm Williamson]] ([[Symphony No. 7 (Williamson)|Symphony No. 7]]). Sir [[Michael Tippett]] wrote a ''[[Concerto for Double String Orchestra (Tippett)|Concerto for Double String Orchestra]]'' and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] wrote a ''Partita for Double String Orchestra''. Composers who have written a [[Serenade]] for string orchestra include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Suk]] and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], in his youth, also wrote a number of symphonies for string orchestra.\n\n{{listen\n|filename = Danse Sacr\u00e9e.ogg\n|title = Danse Sacr\u00e9e L 103, No. 1\n|filename2 = Danse Profane.ogg\n|title2 = Danse Profane L 103, No. 2\n|description 2= Danses sacr\u00e9e et profane by [[Debussy]], performed by the [[United States Marine Corps Band|United States Marine Chamber Orchestra]].

[[Samuel Barber]]'s ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'', [[Alban Berg]]'s 3 Pieces from his ''Lyric Suite'', [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s string sextet ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and String Quartet No. 2, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s sextet ''[[Souvenir de Florence]]'', [[John Corigliano]]'s Second String Quartet and [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Andante Festivo]]'' are examples. An optional timpani part is also added in the Sibelius piece. The work ''[[Shaker Loops]]'' written in 1978 for septet then arranged in 1983 for string orchestra by the American composer [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] has become a popular addition to the repertoire in recent times. [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed several works for string orchestra (''Sinfonietta''), also in combination with contrasting sounds as [[Great Highland Bagpipe]] (''[[Chieftain's Salute]]'').\n\n==Other works for string orchestra==\n{{Main|:Category:Compositions for string orchestra}}\n*Giovanni Albini: ''Una teoria della prossimit\u00e0'' (2006)\n*[[Louis Andriessen]]: ''Symphony for Open Strings''\n*[[Lera Auerbach]]: \n**String Symphony \"Memoria de la Luz\" (2013)\n**Serenade for a Melancholic Sea for violin, violoncello, piano and string orchestra (2002)\n** Dialogues of Stabat Mater (after G.B.

section]] made up of the bowed strings used in Western Classical music.  The instruments of such an orchestra are most often the following:  the [[violin]], which is divided into first and second violin players (each usually playing different parts), the [[viola]], the [[cello]], and usually, but not always, the [[double bass]].\n\nString orchestras can be of chamber orchestra size ranging from between 12 (4 first violins, 3 second violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos and 1 bass = 12) and 21 musicians (6 first violins, 5 second violins, 4 violas, 4 cellos and 2 double basses= 21) sometimes performing without a [[Conducting|conductor]]. It could also consist of the entire string section of a large symphony orchestra which could have 60 musicians (16 first violins, 14 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos and 8 double basses = 60; ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' calls for 84: 20.20.16.16.12).<ref name=\"CarnicerMisol2008\">{{cite book|author1=Josep Gustems Carnicer|author2=Edmon Elgstr\u00f6m Misol|title=Gu\u00eda pr\u00e1ctica para la direcci\u00f3n de grupos vocales e instrumentales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIwVi5HJMcEC&pg=PA32|year=2008|publisher=Grao|isbn=978-84-7827-643-1|pages=32\u201334|language=es}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\n{{listen\n|filename = Serenade for Strings -mvt-1- Elgar.ogg\n|title = Serenade for Strings (Op. 20, mv 1)\n|description = [[Edward Elgar]]'s \"[[Serenade for Strings (Elgar)|Serenade for Strings]], movement 1\" performed by the [[United States Army Band]] Strings ensemble\n}}\nThe repertoire includes several works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (including ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]''), [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]] (his eight symphonies are for strings only), and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] which dispense with the baroque [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. Some of these works are problematic when it comes to deciding whether they are for orchestra or [[string quartet]]. Particularly in Haydn's early works it is argued that the inversions of harmony from the occasional crossings of the bass and viola line imply a double bass; the question is not settled, however.\n\nImportant 20th century works have been written for string orchestra by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] ([[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]]), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] (''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]''), [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]] (''[[Musique fun\u00e8bre]]''), [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Simple Symphony]]'' and ''[[Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge]]''), [[Charles Wuorinen]] (''Grand Bamboula''), and [[Malcolm Williamson]] ([[Symphony No. 7 (Williamson)|Symphony No. 7]]). Sir [[Michael Tippett]] wrote a ''[[Concerto for Double String Orchestra (Tippett)|Concerto for Double String Orchestra]]'' and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] wrote a ''Partita for Double String Orchestra''. Composers who have written a [[Serenade]] for string orchestra include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Suk]] and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], in his youth, also wrote a number of symphonies for string orchestra.\n\n{{listen\n|filename = Danse Sacr\u00e9e.ogg\n|title = Danse Sacr\u00e9e L 103, No. 1\n|filename2 = Danse Profane.ogg\n|title2 = Danse Profane L 103, No. 2\n|description 2= Danses sacr\u00e9e et profane by [[Debussy]], performed by the [[United States Marine Corps Band|United States Marine Chamber Orchestra]].

[[Samuel Barber]]'s ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'', [[Alban Berg]]'s 3 Pieces from his ''Lyric Suite'', [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s string sextet ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and String Quartet No. 2, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s sextet ''[[Souvenir de Florence]]'', [[John Corigliano]]'s Second String Quartet and [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Andante Festivo]]'' are examples. An optional timpani part is also added in the Sibelius piece. The work ''[[Shaker Loops]]'' written in 1978 for septet then arranged in 1983 for string orchestra by the American composer [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] has become a popular addition to the repertoire in recent times. [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed several works for string orchestra (''Sinfonietta''), also in combination with contrasting sounds as [[Great Highland Bagpipe]] (''[[Chieftain's Salute]]'').\n\n==Other works for string orchestra==\n{{Main|:Category:Compositions for string orchestra}}\n*Giovanni Albini: ''Una teoria della prossimit\u00e0'' (2006)\n*[[Louis Andriessen]]: ''Symphony for Open Strings''\n*[[Lera Auerbach]]: \n**String Symphony \"Memoria de la Luz\" (2013)\n**Serenade for a Melancholic Sea for violin, violoncello, piano and string orchestra (2002)\n** Dialogues of Stabat Mater (after G.B.

In Kosovo the ethnic cleansing was carried out by Serbs \u2013 the opponents of secession; In Abkhazia it was committed by the secessionists. While the right of return of refugees to Kosovo was a precondition for self-determination, in Abkhazia the self-determination is linked with the refusal to allow the return of internally displaced people. Abkhaz separatists rejected several peace plans proposed by Georgia, the [[United Nations]], and [[Germany]]; while in Kosovo it was Serbia that rejected peace efforts. After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F.

This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens.

In Kosovo the ethnic cleansing was carried out by Serbs \u2013 the opponents of secession; In Abkhazia it was committed by the secessionists. While the right of return of refugees to Kosovo was a precondition for self-determination, in Abkhazia the self-determination is linked with the refusal to allow the return of internally displaced people. Abkhaz separatists rejected several peace plans proposed by Georgia, the [[United Nations]], and [[Germany]]; while in Kosovo it was Serbia that rejected peace efforts. After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F.

This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens.
