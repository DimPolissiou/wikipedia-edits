In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723152436/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |archivedate=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church Sexual Abuse====\n{{see also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat}}\nThe [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse#Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] final report published on 15 December 2017 found that 139 people made a claim of child sexual abuse to the Diocese of Ballarat between 1980 and 2015 and that there was 21 alleged perpetrators identified in claims.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.\n\nThe contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately {{convert|90|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the local government area's {{convert|740|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Land Use\">{{cite web |url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |title = Ballarat Planning Scheme \u2013 Land Use |accessdate = 14 May 2012 |date = 18 March 2010 |work = City of Ballarat |publisher = City of Ballarat |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420101928/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |archive-date = 20 April 2012 |url-status = dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name=\"Land Use\"/> From the city centre this area extends approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name=\"HIS 2011-10\"/> The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs.

In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat.

In response to an acute housing shortage, significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|archivedate=9 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses.

In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff_(military)#British_and_Commonwealth_staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent. The town's website records that of 381{{nbsp}}houses in the town proper, 231{{nbsp}}were destroyed and another 30&nbsp;badly damaged.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} A few days later, a Canadian nurse wrote home that the [[convent]] on the edge of town was the only building left standing.{{sfn|Hibbert|1985|p=84}} In the suburb of Altenoythe, 120{{nbsp}}houses and 110{{nbsp}}other buildings were destroyed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} In 2010, the author Mark Zuehlke suggested that, \"Not all of Friesoythe was burnt, but its centre was destroyed\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n{{Quote box|width=20em|align=left|quote=You should know our soldiers were kind to the children of our enemies, and kind to those in adversity.

After a German act of [[perfidy]]{{snd}}the mayor surrendered the town but the first tank to enter was destroyed by a [[Panzerfaust]]{{snd}}the battalion commander, Wigle's brother-in-law, ordered that \"every building which did not show a white flag be fired\".{{sfn|L&WR archive|1945}} Before it could be carried out, the order was countermanded and the village was spared.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=312}} A Canadian force was also authorized to burn down the village of [[Mittelsten]] following what the historian Perry Briddiscombe calls \"an unnamed transgression\". They were talked out of this by a Canadian engineer unit as Mittelsten's civilians were running an army sawmill.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=258}}\n\n===Post-war===\nIn early 1946 Vokes heard an appeal against the death sentence of [[Kurt Meyer]], a convicted German war criminal. Referring to his discussions about this Vokes said to the [[Vincent Massey|Canadian High Commissioner]] in London, \"I told them of S\u00f6gel and Friesoythe and of the prisoners and civilians that my troops had killed in Italy and Northwest Europe\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} Vokes [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentence to life imprisonment saying, \"There isn't a general or colonel on the Allied side that I know of who hasn't said, 'Well, this time we don't want any prisoners{{'}}\".{{sfn|Brode|1997|p=105}}\n\nThe Canadian Army official historian, Colonel [[Charles Perry Stacey|Charles Stacey]], visited Friesoythe on 15&nbsp;April. He wrote in the Canadian Army official history, which was published in 1960, that \"there is no record of how this [destruction] came about\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|p=309}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|pp=558, 722}} Responding to this, the historian Mark Zuehlke wrote that there were records of the events in the war diaries of several units, but that he did not believe Stacey's vagueness was an attempt at a cover-up.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|p=309}} In his 1982 memoirs Stacey expanded upon the official history to comment that the only time he saw what could be considered a [[war crime]] committed by Canadian soldiers{{#tag:ref|The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|1907 Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land]] (Hague{{nbsp}}IV), Article{{nbsp}}23, prohibits acts that \"destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war.\"{{sfn|ICRC|1907}}|group=Note}} was when\n{{quote|... at Friesoythe, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada&nbsp;... lost their popular commanding officer&nbsp;... as a result a great part of the town of Friesoythe was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal.

How painfully easy it is for the business of \"reprisals\" to get out of hand!{{sfn|Stacey|1982|pp=163\u2013164}}}}\n\nVokes commented in his autobiography, written forty years after the event, that he had \"[a] feeling of no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe. Be that as it may.\"{{sfn|Morton|2016}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} This position may have been motivated by a continued belief that the retaliatory actions were justified.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=295}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Allied war crimes during World War II]]\n* [[List of war crimes]]\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Ambrose | first = Stephen E. | title = Citizen Soldiers: The U.S. Army From the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | year = 1997 | location = New York City, New York | isbn = 0-684-815257 | url = https://archive.org/details/citizensoldiers000ambr|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|id= RG 24, v. 15,005\n|title=Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada War Diary\n|url=\n|location=Ottawa, ON, Canada\n|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]\n|pages=10\u201311\n|isbn=\n|author-link=\n|ref={{sfnRef|A&SHC archive|1945}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Atkinson|title=The Guns at Last Light|location=Great Britain|publisher=[[Abacus]]|date=2015|isbn=978-0-349-14048-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Briddiscombe |first1=Perry |title=Werwolf! : The History of the National Socialist Guerrilla Movement, 1944\u20131946 |date=1998 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-8020-0862-6 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/werwolfhistoryof00bidd }}\n* {{Cite book |title=[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Die Enzyklop\u00e4die]], 20.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff_(military)#British_and_Commonwealth_staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. Because of her short height and the lack of nonadjustable microphones, Seely had to stand on top of wooden containers to sing.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/>{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} At age 16, Seely became a regular performer on [[WICU (AM)|WICU]], a local television station in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"PBS\"/> She recounted being ridiculed by her high school peers in choosing to sing country music. \"They all made fun of me because I sang country. I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]]. In 1958, she graduated from Townville High School at age eighteen.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} \n\nInstead of attending college, Seely took a job at the Titusville Trust Company as a [[stenographer]]. She was later promoted to a secretarial position.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}}{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Rather than taking collegiate-level courses, she enrolled at the [[American Bankers Association|American Institute of Banking]] and took night classes.<ref name=\"Meadville\"/> She later reflected that having background knowledge in finance and law helped her better understand the music business.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Although Seely was living in Pennsylvania still, she was getting increasingly frustrated by the Pennsylvania winters. One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and she was forced to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Music career==\n===1961\u20131965: California and early songwriting===\nIn 1961, Seely made the decision to move to southern California.

Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by Cathy Worthington in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. \n\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Jeannie on Opry 040818.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jeannie Seely in performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], 2010s.]]\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''Changing Hearts'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]].

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car.

Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by Cathy Worthington in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. \n\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Jeannie on Opry 040818.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jeannie Seely in performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], 2010s.]]\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''Changing Hearts'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''Life's Highway'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood.

In 2016, a new [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] show called \"Pocoyo Planet\" was created.\n\nSet in a [[3D computer graphics|3D space]], with a plain white background and usually no backdrops, it is about Pocoyo, a 4-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato (a [[duck]]), Elly (an [[elephant]]) and Loula (a [[dog]]). Viewers are encouraged to recognize situations that Pocoyo is in, and things that are going on with or around him. The narrator usually speaks explicitly to the viewers and to the characters as well. Each character has its own distinctive dance and also a specific sound (usually from a musical instrument), and most episodes end with the characters dancing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was originally broadcast on [[CITV]], a children's strand on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. In September 2005, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] acquired [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial rights]] in the United Kingdom to the first and second series, making it part of the ''[[Milkshake!]]'' strand.

He is very acrobatic and moves at a quick speed. He is always shown wearing blue clothes and a hat. His best friends are Pato, Elly, and Loula. He has a vehicle called the Vamoosh which he can use to travel under the water, in the air or through space. Although he is very friendly and sweet and almost always in a good mood, Pocoyo is also highly self-centered, distracted by the simplest things, easily frustrated, frequently jealous of his friends, and disobedient, but tries his hardest to fight his flaws and learn morals. He is voiced by Alex Marty in Season 1, Montana Smedley in Season 2, Isabella Foy in Season 3 and Gigi Hart in Season 4.\n* The Narrator (del Rio, Fry or Hughes) speaks over the entire show, and often communicates directly with the characters. Pocoyo has a good relationship with him, and is always really delighted to see (hear) him.  The narrator is also at times physically involved in the events of the episodes, making him more of a heard-but-not-seen character rather than a strict narrator.\n* Pato is a yellow duck who wears nothing but a small green hat. He has a fondness for gardening, and is often seen watering plants and flowerbeds. Pato means duck in Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Tok Pisin]] and [[Papiamento]]. He is a favourite amongst the young children due to his enjoyable dancing and the fact that his beak turns 360 degrees. Although friendly, Pato is the most fussy and impatient character (indicated by his beak that bends in an angle when disappointed or shocked); on occasion he completely loses his temper, jumping up and down and quacking furiously with his beak spinning rapidly. He is used as a jackhammer or missile and can become a helicopter. In the pilot episode in 2003, he was first called Ducky then changed the name to Pato.\n* Elly is a pink elephant who always wears a blue backpack. She loves making biscuits and tea, and has a doll that she loves very much. Despite her size, she is graceful and gentle, capable of ballet dancing. She is, however, very bossy and generally does things her way. She usually rides around on her pink [[kick scooter|scooter]].\n* Loula is Pocoyo's orange-yellow pet puppy and companion. She is also strictly a dog as she walks on all four of her legs. She sometimes hops as she is walking. Originally, the character's name was Lucas, in tribute to creator and director Guillermo Garc\u00eda Carsi's dog, but due to a shortage of female characters, the character was renamed Loula.\n* Sleepy Bird is a teal-coloured bird. She does little but sleep, and usually flies with her eyes closed. She is named \"Pajaroto\" in the Spanish version (reportedly named after a Zinkia employee nicknamed \"Maroto\", and bearing a strong resemblance to him).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The character is also known as \"Pajaro Dormilon\" in the LATAM-Latin American Spanish version. For the episodes where Nina is present (excluding her debut appearance and the episodes where she's absent), she was digitally removed from the title sequence to make room for Nina.\n* The Children are a group of kids who, like The Narrator, speak over the show, answering questions asked by The Narrator in order to assist Pocoyo in solving a problem or to let Pocoyo in on what's going on.\n* Nina is an another human character who is introduced in the 4th Season episode of the same name. She a young girl similar to Pocoyo who has red hair, wears a lime green hoodie with two antennas, lime green shorts and lime green shoes, and also speaks gibberish. Her name is Spanish for \"girl\". Thanks to her robotic pet called Roberto (pronounced Roh-bear-toe), it has the ability to shrink where anyone can be shrunk as well. She replaces Loula's bit in the title sequence (except in her debut appearance and the episodes where she's absent). She is voiced by Noela Rodriguez.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Aliens are sweet, big and little green, pink, and blue [[tripedalism|tripedal]] beings that Pocoyo finds in space in search of his toy plane and other adventures. They communicate with one another using staccato 'clicking' noises.\n* Baby Bird is the small, always active (he has not inherited his mother's fondness of sleeping) and loud baby of Sleepy Bird, who gets into tricky situations from which he is rescued by Pocoyo. He is best friends with Caterpillar. Named \"Pajarito\" in the Spanish version ('little bird').\n* Ball Orchestra is a group of three ball-like creatures who play the trumpet, drums and cymbals. In Season 4 episode \"Space Postal Service\", they live in a planet filled with instruments.\n* Butterfly is a very hungry butterfly which Pocoyo occasionally catches.\n* Caterpillar (named \"Valentina\" or \"Oruga\" in Spanish) is a yellow caterpillar with a blue bow on top of her head. She speaks in gibberish and has the ability to change into a butterfly and back when she wants. She is best friends with Baby Bird and friends with Angry Alien. When overjoyed or frustrated, she tends to slam her face forward into the ground.\n* Fred the Octopus/Octopus (AKA Pulpo in the Spanish version) is a lunatic red octopus (although shown with only 4 legs, as to make animation rendering simpler) who speaks in gibberish like Caterpillar, and is very fond of opera singing. He appears in random episodes, sometimes as a major character, sometimes in passing. As of Season Two, he is sometimes referred to as 'Fred'. His vocal style is reminiscent of [[Pee-wee Herman]].\n* Music Flower & The Band are musical characters who play music that Pocoyo likes.\n* Whale is a huge white whale with red cheeks whom Pocoyo meets under the sea.\n* Baby Spider is a small blue spider that hatched out of an egg that Pato finds.\n\n==Episodes==\nTo date three series have been produced, each with 52 episodes, and a fourth, with 28 episodes.

Three series have been produced, each consisting of 52 seven-minute episodes, and a fourth season consisting of 26 seven-minute episodes. [[England|English]] actor and comedian [[Stephen Fry]] narrates the English-language version<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487849/ |title=Let's Go, Pocoyo  |publisher=IMDb |date=22 November 2019  |website=imdb.com |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pocoyo.com/en/funny-videos/season-1 |title=Umbrella! |publisher=Zinkia Entertainment, S.A. |date=2018-05-25 |website=pocoyo.com |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda del R\u00edo narrates the [[Castilian Spanish]] version of the first two seasons, while Stephen Hughes narrates the third season, called [[Let's Go Pocoyo]]. In 2016, a new [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] show called \"Pocoyo Planet\" was created.\n\nSet in a [[3D computer graphics|3D space]], with a plain white background and usually no backdrops, it is about Pocoyo, a 4-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato (a [[duck]]), Elly (an [[elephant]]) and Loula (a [[dog]]). Viewers are encouraged to recognize situations that Pocoyo is in, and things that are going on with or around him. The narrator usually speaks explicitly to the viewers and to the characters as well.

He is a four-year-old boy<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pocoyo.com/blog-en/faq_10/ | title = FAQ (1.0) | date = 2006-10-10 | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | publisher = The Official Pocoyo Blog | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209084636/http://www.pocoyo.com/blog-en/faq_10/ | archivedate = 9 December 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> who is full of curiosity and loves to play games and discover new things. He is very acrobatic and moves at a quick speed. He is always shown wearing blue clothes and a hat. His best friends are Pato, Elly, and Loula. He has a vehicle called the Vamoosh which he can use to travel under the water, in the air or through space. Although he is very friendly and sweet and almost always in a good mood, Pocoyo is also highly self-centered, distracted by the simplest things, easily frustrated, frequently jealous of his friends, and disobedient, but tries his hardest to fight his flaws and learn morals. He is voiced by Alex Marty in Season 1, Montana Smedley in Season 2, Isabella Foy in Season 3 and Gigi Hart in Season 4.\n* The Narrator (del Rio, Fry or Hughes) speaks over the entire show, and often communicates directly with the characters. Pocoyo has a good relationship with him, and is always really delighted to see (hear) him.  The narrator is also at times physically involved in the events of the episodes, making him more of a heard-but-not-seen character rather than a strict narrator.\n* Pato is a yellow duck who wears nothing but a small green hat. He has a fondness for gardening, and is often seen watering plants and flowerbeds. Pato means duck in Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Tok Pisin]] and [[Papiamento]]. He is a favourite amongst the young children due to his enjoyable dancing and the fact that his beak turns 360 degrees. Although friendly, Pato is the most fussy and impatient character (indicated by his beak that bends in an angle when disappointed or shocked); on occasion he completely loses his temper, jumping up and down and quacking furiously with his beak spinning rapidly. He is used as a jackhammer or missile and can become a helicopter. In the pilot episode in 2003, he was first called Ducky then changed the name to Pato.\n* Elly is a pink elephant who always wears a blue backpack. She loves making biscuits and tea, and has a doll that she loves very much. Despite her size, she is graceful and gentle, capable of ballet dancing. She is, however, very bossy and generally does things her way. She usually rides around on her pink [[kick scooter|scooter]].\n* Loula is Pocoyo's orange-yellow pet puppy and companion. She is also strictly a dog as she walks on all four of her legs. She sometimes hops as she is walking. Originally, the character's name was Lucas, in tribute to creator and director Guillermo Garc\u00eda Carsi's dog, but due to a shortage of female characters, the character was renamed Loula.\n* Sleepy Bird is a teal-coloured bird. She does little but sleep, and usually flies with her eyes closed. She is named \"Pajaroto\" in the Spanish version (reportedly named after a Zinkia employee nicknamed \"Maroto\", and bearing a strong resemblance to him).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The character is also known as \"Pajaro Dormilon\" in the LATAM-Latin American Spanish version. For the episodes where Nina is present (excluding her debut appearance and the episodes where she's absent), she was digitally removed from the title sequence to make room for Nina.\n* The Children are a group of kids who, like The Narrator, speak over the show, answering questions asked by The Narrator in order to assist Pocoyo in solving a problem or to let Pocoyo in on what's going on.\n* Nina is an another human character who is introduced in the 4th Season episode of the same name. She a young girl similar to Pocoyo who has red hair, wears a lime green hoodie with two antennas, lime green shorts and lime green shoes, and also speaks gibberish. Her name is Spanish for \"girl\". Thanks to her robotic pet called Roberto (pronounced Roh-bear-toe), it has the ability to shrink where anyone can be shrunk as well. She replaces Loula's bit in the title sequence (except in her debut appearance and the episodes where she's absent). She is voiced by Noela Rodriguez.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Aliens are sweet, big and little green, pink, and blue [[tripedalism|tripedal]] beings that Pocoyo finds in space in search of his toy plane and other adventures. They communicate with one another using staccato 'clicking' noises.\n* Baby Bird is the small, always active (he has not inherited his mother's fondness of sleeping) and loud baby of Sleepy Bird, who gets into tricky situations from which he is rescued by Pocoyo. He is best friends with Caterpillar. Named \"Pajarito\" in the Spanish version ('little bird').\n* Ball Orchestra is a group of three ball-like creatures who play the trumpet, drums and cymbals. In Season 4 episode \"Space Postal Service\", they live in a planet filled with instruments.\n* Butterfly is a very hungry butterfly which Pocoyo occasionally catches.\n* Caterpillar (named \"Valentina\" or \"Oruga\" in Spanish) is a yellow caterpillar with a blue bow on top of her head. She speaks in gibberish and has the ability to change into a butterfly and back when she wants. She is best friends with Baby Bird and friends with Angry Alien. When overjoyed or frustrated, she tends to slam her face forward into the ground.\n* Fred the Octopus/Octopus (AKA Pulpo in the Spanish version) is a lunatic red octopus (although shown with only 4 legs, as to make animation rendering simpler) who speaks in gibberish like Caterpillar, and is very fond of opera singing. He appears in random episodes, sometimes as a major character, sometimes in passing. As of Season Two, he is sometimes referred to as 'Fred'. His vocal style is reminiscent of [[Pee-wee Herman]].\n* Music Flower & The Band are musical characters who play music that Pocoyo likes.\n* Whale is a huge white whale with red cheeks whom Pocoyo meets under the sea.\n* Baby Spider is a small blue spider that hatched out of an egg that Pato finds.\n\n==Episodes==\nTo date three series have been produced, each with 52 episodes, and a fourth, with 28 episodes.

Marcial Kasilag as its first president.<ref name=\"prc\" /><ref>{{cite news|first=|title=Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers 75th Anniversary and National Convention|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/382432/philippine-institute-of-civil-engineers-75th-anniversary-and-national-convention#.UPE6VW_qmSo|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=November 21, 2012|access-date=January 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128070548/http://mb.com.ph/articles/382432/philippine-institute-of-civil-engineers-75th-anniversary-and-national-convention#.UPE6VW_qmSo|archive-date=November 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the '''Philippine Association of Civil Engineers''' (PACE) was formed. This time, it was a group of civil engineers in the private sector with Engr. Enrique Sto. Tomas Cortes as its first president.<ref name=\"prc\" />\n\nThe objectives of both organizations were similar with each other in which both of them wants to: \"elevate the standards of the profession, encourage research and engineering knowledge and technology, foster fellowship among members, and promote interrelation with other technological and scientific societies\".\n\nThe '''PACE''' being the most active than the '''PSCE''' led to the transfer of many '''PSCE''' members to '''PACE'''. In 1950, Republic Act No. 544 (also known as the \"Civil Engineering Law\") was passed through the efforts of  '''PACE''' President Alberto Guevarra.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Act to Regulate the Practice of Civil Engineering in the Philippines|url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-544.php|publisher=The Corpus Juris|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816125804/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-544.php|archive-date=2018-08-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, PACE President Engr. Cesar A. Caliwara, exerted a serious effort in merging the two organization. Leaders of '''PACE''' and '''PSCE''' negotiated, and talked about the choice of name. Some concerns were raised such as formal accounting and turnover of assets and liabilities, accreditation of bonafide members and election rules for the first officers which were sooner resolved. These gave birth to the '''Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers Inc.''' and on December 11, 1973, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a registration certificate to the association.\n\nOn February 1974, the first election of officers was held and Engr.  Cesar Caliwara became its first president. In order to truly unite the civil engineers of the Philippines, provincial chapters were organized. In August 13, 1975, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) recognized the '''PICE''' as the only official organization of civil engineers in the Philippines.\n\n==Present time==\n\nOn November 5, 2014, Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]] issued a declaration by virtue of Proclamation No. 904 signed by Executive Secretary Paquito N.

But in 2005, a petition for declaratory relief filed on May 3, 2005 by the PICE and Engr. Leo Cleto Gamolo to declare null and void Sections 302.3 and 302.4 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (\u201cRevised IRR\u201d) of [http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1096.html Presidential Decree No. 1096 (the \u201cNational Building Code\u201d).] The said provisions require that architectural documents submitted in applications for building permits must be prepared, signed and sealed by architects. PICE claim that the said sections of the Revised IRR, by effectively prohibiting Civil Engineers from also preparing, signing and sealing architectural documents, are contrary to the National Building Code and the Republic Act No. 544 (the \u201cCivil Engineering Law\u201d), which purportedly gave Civil Engineers the said right.\nAfter several court hearings at the Manila Regional Trial Court, the PICE's motion was denied and the RTC ruled in favor of the architects.

Marcial Kasilag as its first president.<ref name=\"prc\" /><ref>{{cite news|first=|title=Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers 75th Anniversary and National Convention|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/382432/philippine-institute-of-civil-engineers-75th-anniversary-and-national-convention#.UPE6VW_qmSo|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=November 21, 2012|access-date=January 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128070548/http://mb.com.ph/articles/382432/philippine-institute-of-civil-engineers-75th-anniversary-and-national-convention#.UPE6VW_qmSo|archive-date=November 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the '''Philippine Association of Civil Engineers''' (PACE) was formed. This time, it was a group of civil engineers in the private sector with Engr. Enrique Sto. Tomas Cortes as its first president.<ref name=\"prc\" />\n\nThe objectives of both organizations were similar with each other in which both of them wants to: \"elevate the standards of the profession, encourage research and engineering knowledge and technology, foster fellowship among members, and promote interrelation with other technological and scientific societies\".\n\nThe '''PACE''' being the most active than the '''PSCE''' led to the transfer of many '''PSCE''' members to '''PACE'''. In 1950, Republic Act No. 544 (also known as the \"Civil Engineering Law\") was passed through the efforts of  '''PACE''' President Alberto Guevarra.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Act to Regulate the Practice of Civil Engineering in the Philippines|url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-544.php|publisher=The Corpus Juris|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816125804/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-544.php|archive-date=2018-08-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, PACE President Engr. Cesar A. Caliwara, exerted a serious effort in merging the two organization. Leaders of '''PACE''' and '''PSCE''' negotiated, and talked about the choice of name. Some concerns were raised such as formal accounting and turnover of assets and liabilities, accreditation of bonafide members and election rules for the first officers which were sooner resolved. These gave birth to the '''Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers Inc.''' and on December 11, 1973, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a registration certificate to the association.\n\nOn February 1974, the first election of officers was held and Engr.  Cesar Caliwara became its first president. In order to truly unite the civil engineers of the Philippines, provincial chapters were organized. In August 13, 1975, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) recognized the '''PICE''' as the only official organization of civil engineers in the Philippines.\n\n==Present time==\n\nOn November 5, 2014, Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]] issued a declaration by virtue of Proclamation No. 904 signed by Executive Secretary Paquito N.

But in 2005, a petition for declaratory relief filed on May 3, 2005 by the PICE and Engr.

PICE claim that the said sections of the Revised IRR, by effectively prohibiting Civil Engineers from also preparing, signing and sealing architectural documents, are contrary to the National Building Code and the Republic Act No. 544 (the \u201cCivil Engineering Law\u201d), which purportedly gave Civil Engineers the said right.\nAfter several court hearings at the Manila Regional Trial Court, the PICE's motion was denied and the RTC ruled in favor of the architects.

They are named after [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] in [[Cambridge]], England, where the group was formed by six [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|choral scholars]]. In the United Kingdom, their popularity peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter they began to reach a wider American audience, appearing frequently on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in the United States. In 1987, they were prominently featured as guests on the ''[[Emmy Award]]'' winning ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'' special ''Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas''.\n\nToday the ensemble travels worldwide for its performances, appearing in around 125 concerts each year, mostly in Europe, the US and the Far East, having recently added the People's Republic of China to their list of touring territories. In recent years the group has had several UK appearances at the Royal Albert Hall [[Proms]] and concerts as part of the [[Three Choirs Festival]] and the [[City of London Festival]]. The King's Singers consist of two [[countertenor]]s, a [[tenor]], a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] and two [[baritone (voice type)|baritones]].\n\n==History==\nThe group has always consisted of six singers in total, with their membership changing over the years. None of the original members remain. The first stable incarnation of the group, from late 1969 until 1978, comprised:\n* Nigel Perrin ([[countertenor]] 1)\n* Alastair Hume (countertenor 2)\n* Alastair Thompson ([[tenor]])\n* Anthony Holt ([[baritone]] 1) (actually from [[Christ Church, Oxford]], rather than King's)\n* [[Simon Carrington]] (baritone 2)\n* [[Brian Kay]] ([[bass (vocal range)|bass]])\n\nThe current ensemble is composed of (starting year in brackets):\n* Patrick Dunachie (countertenor 1) \u2013 (2016)\n* Edward Button (countertenor 2) \u2013 (2019)\n* Julian Gregory (tenor) \u2013 (2014)\n* Christopher Bruerton (baritone 1) \u2013 (2012)\n* Nick Ashby (baritone 2) \u2013 (2019)\n* Jonathan Howard (bass) \u2013 (2010)\n\nFormer members of the King's Singers also include [[Jeremy Jackman]], [[Bob Chilcott]],<ref name=\"Beeson\">{{Cite book |title=In Tuneful Accord: The Church Musicians |last=Beeson |first=Trevor |publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern |year=2009 |isbn=9780334041931 |page=205}}</ref> [[Nigel Short (singer and choir director)|Nigel Short]], [[Grayston Ives|Bill Ives]], Bruce Russell, Colin Mason, [[Gabriel Crouch]], Stephen Connolly, [[Robin Tyson]], [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]], [[Paul Phoenix (singer)|Paul Phoenix]], [[David Hurley (singer)|David Hurley]], [[Christopher Gabbitas]] and Timothy Wayne-Wright. There have been 26 members of the King's Singers since the original stable group was established in late 1969, for whom the average length of tenure is around 12 years.\n\nAround the year 2000, the King's Singers briefly called themselves ''king'singers'' (with a lower case k and a single s), as can be seen on the cover of ''Fire-Water''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingssingers.com/products/fire-water-the-spirit-of-renaissance-spain/|title=Fire-Water: The Spirit of Renaissance Spain |website=The King's Singers \u2013 Kingssingers.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> and several song sheets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingssingers.com/products/when-im-64/|title=When I\u2019m 64|website=The King's Singers \u2013 Kingssingers.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref>  This name change did not last long.\n\n===Early years===\nPrior to the establishment of the original stable male-only group cited above, several of the parts were taken by other singers, including three females. The four founding members, who first sang together within a six-man group in 1965, were Alastair Hume, Alastair Thompson, Simon Carrington and Brian Kay. From 1965 until 1968 the first countertenor was Martin Lane and the first baritone was [[Richard Salter (singer)|Richard Salter]]. It was this group of six singers who gave the first concert under the name of the King's Singers on 1 May 1968 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], London, with the [[Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields]], [[Simon Preston]] (organ) and [[Barry Tuckwell]] (horn). Later in 1968, Martin Lane developed a brain tumour and had to withdraw from the group; [[Felicity Palmer]] stood in during 1969 until Nigel Perrin graduated that summer. Then, in 1969, Richard Salter was awarded a Richard Tauber Scholarship and left for Vienna; Nigel Beavan filled the gap until Anthony Holt became available towards the end of the year. Other singers who served as short-term group members were Eleanor Capp, Caryl Newnham and, on one occasion, [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], all of whom took the first countertenor (soprano) role in 1969 when Felicity Palmer was unavailable. For a brief time after he joined the King's Singers, Nigel Perrin also belonged to the Scholars; when double-booked, his King's Singers' duties were fulfilled by Richard Baker (note: not the familiar BBC broadcaster). Neil Jenkins sang tenor in the early pre-King's Singers group's first summer singing tour in 1965, and Peter Hall was another tenor used by the fledgling pre-King's Singers group.<ref name=\"The King's Singers: A Self-Portrait\">{{cite book |title=The King's Singers: A Self-Portrait |last=Singers |first=The King's |year=1980 |publisher=Robson Books |isbn=0-86051-109-X}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingssingers.com/info/about-us/former-singers+8.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615012816/http://www.kingssingers.com/info/about-us/former-singers+8.html |date=15 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===''Madrigal History Tour''===\nIn 1984, the members of the King's Singers (who at the time included two founding members, Alastair Hume and Simon Carrington) presented, narrated and sang in ''Madrigal History Tour'', a six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series about the history of the [[madrigal]] in [[Western Europe]].

It was this serene and precise sound, with vibrato used only as a colour rather than a default setting, that was expanded by the early King's Singers to be used on all genres of music, from renaissance church repertoire such as they had performed as part of the daily chapel services at the university, to pop/jazz/folk/spiritual arrangements that were soon added to their concert programmes.\n\nThe group has also inspired musicians in other countries to create similar ensembles, e.g. [[Affabre Concinui]] in [[Poland]].\n\n==Repertoire==\nThe King's Singers took hold of the idea that concerts need not contain merely one form of music; audiences could be educated as well as entertained. For those who came expecting pop music there would be classical music as well, and vice versa. This started out of necessity; for their first few concerts the group simply had to perform everything they knew in order to fill a concert programme, and this included religious music from their chapel library, along with folksongs and other \"lollipops.\" Over the years their library has expanded so that it now includes some 2,000 works of all styles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The group is best known for its ''a cappella'' performances which have as a foundation a strong bass/baritone blend on which the other voices sit, a principle known as the \"Pyramid of Sound\". They say the \u2018added\u2019 baritone creates more width and depth to their sound. The two baritones and bass allow the top three parts to sit on top of the bed of sound created for them and, given that higher-pitched voices are heard more easily, the effect to the audience is one of complete balance in the overall chordal sound, despite being 'outnumbered' by their lower-pitched colleagues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/in-touch-with-the-kings-singerskings-of-a-capella/|title=In touch with The King\u2019s Singers Kings of A Capella |last=Lee |first=Jenny |date=2014 |website=Interlude |access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref> In addition, the King's Singers have frequently performed with instruments, both in recordings and in concert. One of their most famous songs is \"You Are The New Day.\" They have appeared in many venues, including the famous City Varieties Theatre Leeds, with many appearances on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety programme, ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''. They have also appeared on TV in concert with [[Hinge and Bracket]].\n\n==Concert structure==\nMost of their a cappella concerts are divided into five distinct groups of pieces. The first four vary widely (madrigals, folk songs, recently commissioned pieces, etc.) but are generally taken from the serious side of the group's repertoire, but the last group of the concert is typically a \"[[Close and open harmony|close harmony]]\" set. Often it consists of lighter fare, including music of [[The Beatles]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Harold Arlen]] or [[Irving Berlin]], many of which have been arranged for the group by composers such as [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Jeremy Lubbock]], [[Bob Chilcott]], [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]] and [[John Rutter]]. Sometimes the final set (in a concert of religious music) will be a spiritual harmony set \u2013 entitled \"Songs of Faith and Hope\". This set could be composed of American Spirituals, arranged by contemporary composers, including former group members Philip Lawson and Bob Chilcott. Pieces in this set could include \"[[Simple Gifts]]\", [[Deep River (song)|\"Deep River\"]], \"[[Down to the River to Pray]]\", and \"[[Stand Still]], Jordan\" as well as more spiritual pop songs such as \"Some Folks Lives Roll Easy\" by [[Paul Simon]].\n\nMore recently,{{clarify|date=May 2013}} however, the King's Singers have begun to perform \"concept programmes\" which have a set theme running throughout. These could be simply a 60-minute first-half sequence, often performed in European cathedral concerts, with a Mass or Requiem setting providing the backbone, interspersed with other shorter works, or a more fundamental concept which infuses every piece performed. Examples of this latter art include \"Sacred Bridges\", a programme of Jewish, Islamic and Christian settings of Psalms, performed with Vladimir Ivanoff and his ensemble \"Saraband\". The group have also created concert programmes relating to recent CD recordings, including \"Landscape and Time\" and \"Treason and Dischord\", the latter a programme commemorating the 400th anniversary of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] and including a script read in live performances by actors [[Joss Ackland]] and [[Bill Wallis]]. The group works closely with concert promoters and local agents to determine the best possible programme for each concert, whether for church, concert hall, open-air venue or private house.\n\n==Modern repertoire==\nThe King's Singers are also known for frequently commissioning works from contemporary composers. Starting with \"Timepiece\", commissioned by the Camden Festival in 1972 from composer Paul Patterson (and still regularly performed today), they have continued by commissioning pieces from (amongst others) [[Sally Beamish]], [[Bob Chilcott]], Sir [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Howard Goodall]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Jackson Hill (composer)|Jackson Hill]], [[Graham Lack]], [[Libby Larsen]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]], [[Ivan Moody (composer)|Ivan Moody]], [[Jocelyn Pook]], [[Geoffrey Poole]], [[Francis Pott (composer)|Francis Pott]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Joby Talbot]], Sir [[John Tavener]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]]. In 2008 they performed a piece commissioned jointly for them and the [[National Youth Choirs of Great Britain]] written by [[Eric Whitacre]].\n\n==Awards==\nIn February 2009 the King's Singers' CD, ''Simple Gifts'', won a [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album]]. In February 2012 they won Best Choral Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards along with [[Eric Whitacre]] for the album ''Light and Gold'', on which they performed \"The Stolen Child\", written for the group by Whitacre. Their DVD, \"Live at the BBC Proms\", won a MIDEM Award at the annual ceremony in Cannes in 2010 for Best DVD Performance. In 2013 the group was inducted into the [[Gramophone Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CONGRATULATIONS TO GRAMOPHONE HALL OF FAMERS ANDSNES, FLEMING, ISSERLIS & THE KING\u2019S SINGERS|url=http://imgartists.com/news/congratulations_to_gramophone_hall_of_famers_andsnes_fleming_galway_the_kin/|website=IMG Artists|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Activities of former members==\nMany former members of the King's Singers have remained active in the world of [[Choir|choral music]].

[[Robin Tyson]] runs the artist management company at [[Edition Peters]]. Former Bass Stephen Connolly runs his residential International A Cappella School (IAS) every summer in the UK and also travels the world delivering choral workshops and masterclasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaschools.org|title=Stephen Connolly International A Cappella School}}</ref> Baritone Simon Carrington is director emeritus of the [[Yale Schola Cantorum]] at the Yale Institute for Sacred Music and now directs the Simon Carrington Singers based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  Tony Holt is on the music faculty at [[St. Olaf College]] as a voice instructor.  The original bass, Brian Kay, became well known as a radio and TV broadcaster; Bruce Russell is now vicar of St Francis' Church, [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] in Berkshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://langleymarish.com/stfrancis/|title=St. Francis' Church|publisher=Langleymarish.com|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\nPaul Phoenix founded his own consultancy, PurpleVocals and in September 2019 opens PPA, Paul Phoenix Academy, his own private music school in Hong Kong. As Executive Director he directs instrumental and composition tuition. [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]] is active as a composer, arranger, workshop leader, and conductor. Since 2016 he has been Musical Director of [[The Romsey Singers]]\n\n==Educational activities==\nIn addition to recording and performing, the King's Singers have a commitment to education, often participating in [[master class]]es and workshops. Every two years they hold a residency at the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival in [[L\u00fcbeck]], Germany, at which up to 12 a cappella groups from all over the world are taught over a period of four days, culminating in a public performance. The group also leads around a dozen additional one-off masterclasses throughout the year, normally in conjunction with concert performances and often as part of their twice-yearly US tours. During its time, the King's Singers have taught many groups that have now become known in their own right, such as [[Club for Five]], [[The Real Group]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, [[Rajaton]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, Singer Pur and Calmus Ensemble.\n\nSeveral of the King's Singers also arranged pieces, both for the group and pieces to publish in their line of music. Recently, [[Philip Lawson (singer)|Philip Lawson]] and [[Bob Chilcott]] have been the most prolific composers for the group.\n\nThe group established The King's Singers Summer School in 2013 taking place on campus at Royal Holloway, University of London. The Summer School took place for a second time in 2015 and saw composer and conductor [[Eric Whitacre]] and Eton Choirbook expert Dr. Stephen Darlington as special guests. In 2017, the Summer School participants performed an [[Evensong]] at the [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], under the direction of [[Christopher Robinson (musician)|Christopher Robinson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kingssingers/photos/a.10152252295502904.1073741830.14404452903/10155658264527904/?type=3&theater|title=The King's Singers|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref> The first US Summer School took place between 13\u201319 June 2017 at DePauw University, Indiana followed by the third School at Royal Holloway on 17\u201322 July 2017.

The sound on this new album marks a departure from the more acoustic albums of the past decade, using extensive post-production techniques and multi-tracking to create a more modern a cappella sound, but retaining the essence of The King's Singers' blend and balance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+King's Singers albums\n!Disc name\n!Release year\n!Instrumentation / Notes\n!# of a cappella tracks\n!# of tracks\n|-\n|''1605: Treason and Dischord''\n|2005\n|Concordia Viol Consort and Sarah Baldock (organ)\n|7\n|15\n|-\n|''\u00c0 la Fran\u00e7aise''\n|1990\n|Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Carl Davis\n|\n|\n|-\n|''All at Once Well Met''\n|1987\n|Lute and Tabor\n|29\n|35\n|-\n|''America''\n|1989, 2006\n|[[English Chamber Orchestra]]\n|0\n|10\n|-\n|''Annie Laurie''\n|1993\n|Guitar, Flute, Piccolo\n|7\n|18\n|-\n|''The [[Beatles]] Connection''\n|1986\n|\n|19\n|19\n|-\n|''By Appointment'' (aka ''Encore'')\n|1971\n|The [[Gordon Langford]] Trio\n|5\n|13\n|-\n|''Capella'' (compilation)\n|2003\n|\n|\n|41\n|-\n|''Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo; Holy Moses''\n|1972, 2005\n|Drums: [[Alf Bigden]], keyboard: [[Steve Gray (musician)|Steve Gray]], bass: Brian Odges (Holy Moses)\n|0\n|18\n|-\n|''Chanson d'amour''\n|1993\n|\n|11\n|21\n|-\n|''Christmas''\n|2003\n|String Quartet and Drums\n|23\n|25\n|-\n|''Circle of Life''\n|1997\n|[[Metropole Orchestra|Metropole Orkest]]\n|3\n|12\n|-\n|''Colouring Book''\n|2005\n|\n|\n|18\n|-\n|''Contemporary Collection''\n|1975\n|Double bass\n|\n|5\n|-\n|''Courtly Pleasures''\n|1973\n|[[Early Music Consort]] of London, [[David Munrow]]\n|\n|22\n|-\n|''Deck the Hall \u2013 Songs for Christmas''\n|1973, 1991\n|\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|''English & Italian Madrigals''\n|1974, 1989\n|(reissue of ''King's Singers Madrigal Collection'')\n|21\n|21\n|-\n|''English Renaissance''\n|1995\n|\n|20\n|20\n|-\n|''Fire~Water''\n|2000\n|[[Andrew Lawrence-King]], [[The Harp Consort]]\n|\n|17\n|-\n|''A French Collection''\n|1973\n|[[Early Music Consort]] of London, [[David Munrow]]\n|\n|16\n|-\n|''Gesualdo: Tenebrae Responses for [[Maundy Thursday]]''\n|2004\n|\n|14\n|14\n|-\n|''Get Happy!''\n|1991\n|[[George Shearing]] (piano), [[Neil Swainson]] (double bass), [[John Harle]] (saxophone)\n|3\n|17\n|-\n|''The Golden Age \u2013 Siglo de Oro''\n|2008\n|Keith McGowan\n|\n|10\n|-\n|''Good Vibrations''\n|1993\n|\n|13\n|13\n|-\n|''Great American Songbook''\n|2013\n|\n|17\n|17\n|-\n|''Here's a Howdy Do!''\n|1993\n|Sound Effects, Organ, Piano, Double Bass, Drums\n|11\n|15\n|-\n|''High Flight''\n|2011\n|The Concordia Choir\n|13\n|14\n|-\n|''In Memoriam Josquin Desprez'' (compilation)\n|2012\n|\n|13\n|13\n|-\n\n|''De Janequin aux Beatles'' (compilation)\n|1999\n|Various\n|\n|55\n|-\n|''Joy to the World''\n|2011\n|\n|18\n|18\n|-\n|''Kids' Stuff''\n|1986, 2000\n|[[Judi Dench]], Various\n|\n|14\n|-\n|''Keep on Changing''\n|1975\n|\n|12\n|12\n|-\n|''The King's Singers Madrigal Collection''\n|1974\n|\n|21\n|21\n|-\n|''The King's Singers Original Debut Recording''\n|1971, 1992\n|The [[Gordon Langford]] Trio (reissue of ''By Appointment'')\n|5\n|13\n|-\n|''The King\u2019s Singers sing Flanders & Swann and Noel Coward''\n|1977\n|\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|''Landscape & Time''\n|2006\n|\n|11\n|11\n|-\n|''Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti Edition, Vol. 4 (Vocal Works)''\n|1997\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|''A Little Christmas Music''\n|1989\n|[[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[City of London Sinfonia]]\n|7\n|20\n|-\n|''Lollipops''\n|1975\n|\n|11\n|11\n|-\n|''Madrigal History Tour''\n|1984, 1989\n|Consort of Musicke\n|0\n|34\n|-\n|''My Spirit Sang All Day''\n|1988\n|\n|25\n|25\n|-\n|''Nana's book of songs''\n|1974\n|Nana Mouskouri, orchestra\n|\n|10\n|-\n|''New Day''\n|1980\n|\n|9\n|15\n|-\n|''Nightsong''\n|1997\n|Various\n|5\n|15\n|-\n|''Out of the Blue''\n|1974\n|Instrumental ensemble\n|\n|12\n|-\n|''Pater Noster: A Choral Reflection on the Lord's Prayer''\n|2012\n|\n|25\n|25\n|-\n|''Postcards''\n|2014\n|\n|22\n|22\n|-\n|''The Quiet Heart \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.1''\n|2006\n|\n|19\n|19\n|-\n|''Reflections \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.2''\n|2008\n|\n|20\n|20\n|-\n|''In This Quiet Moment \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.3''\n|2010\n|\n|18\n|18\n|-\n|''[[Rejoice and Be Merry!

They are named after [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] in [[Cambridge]], England, where the group was formed by six [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|choral scholars]]. In the United Kingdom, their popularity peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter they began to reach a wider American audience, appearing frequently on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in the United States. In 1987, they were prominently featured as guests on the ''[[Emmy Award]]'' winning ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'' special ''Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas''.\n\nToday the ensemble travels worldwide for its performances, appearing in around 125 concerts each year, mostly in Europe, the US and the Far East, having recently added the People's Republic of China to their list of touring territories. In recent years the group has had several UK appearances at the Royal Albert Hall [[Proms]] and concerts as part of the [[Three Choirs Festival]] and the [[City of London Festival]]. The King's Singers consist of two [[countertenor]]s, a [[tenor]], a [[Bass (guitar)|bass]] and two [[baritone (voice type)|baritones]].\n\n==History==\nThe group has always consisted of six singers in total, with their membership changing over the years. None of the original members remain. The first stable incarnation of the group, from late 1969 until 1978, comprised:\n* Nigel Perrin ([[countertenor]] 1)\n* Alastair Hume (countertenor 2)\n* Alastair Thompson ([[tenor]])\n* Anthony Holt ([[baritone]] 1) (actually from [[Christ Church, Oxford]], rather than King's)\n* [[Simon Carrington]] (baritone 2)\n* [[Brian Kay]] ([[bass (vocal range)|bass]])\n\nThe current ensemble is composed of (starting year in brackets):\n* Patrick Dunachie (countertenor 1) \u2013 (2016)\n* Edward Button (countertenor 2) \u2013 (2019)\n* Julian Gregory (tenor) \u2013 (2014)\n* Christopher Bruerton (baritone 1) \u2013 (2012)\n* Nick Ashby (baritone 2) \u2013 (2019)\n* Jonathan Howard (bass) \u2013 (2010)\n\nFormer members of the King's Singers also include [[Jeremy Jackman]], [[Bob Chilcott]],<ref name=\"Beeson\">{{Cite book |title=In Tuneful Accord: The Church Musicians |last=Beeson |first=Trevor |publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern |year=2009 |isbn=9780334041931 |page=205}}</ref> [[Nigel Short (singer and choir director)|Nigel Short]], [[Grayston Ives|Bill Ives]], Bruce Russell, Colin Mason, [[Gabriel Crouch]], Stephen Connolly, [[Robin Tyson]], [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]], [[Paul Phoenix (singer)|Paul Phoenix]], [[David Hurley (singer)|David Hurley]], [[Christopher Gabbitas]] and Timothy Wayne-Wright. There have been 26 members of the King's Singers since the original stable group was established in late 1969, for whom the average length of tenure is around 12 years.\n\nAround the year 2000, the King's Singers briefly called themselves ''king'singers'' (with a lower case k and a single s), as can be seen on the cover of ''Fire-Water''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingssingers.com/products/fire-water-the-spirit-of-renaissance-spain/|title=Fire-Water: The Spirit of Renaissance Spain |website=The King's Singers \u2013 Kingssingers.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> and several song sheets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingssingers.com/products/when-im-64/|title=When I\u2019m 64|website=The King's Singers \u2013 Kingssingers.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref>  This name change did not last long.\n\n===Early years===\nPrior to the establishment of the original stable male-only group cited above, several of the parts were taken by other singers, including three females. The four founding members, who first sang together within a six-man group in 1965, were Alastair Hume, Alastair Thompson, Simon Carrington and Brian Kay. From 1965 until 1968 the first countertenor was Martin Lane and the first baritone was [[Richard Salter (singer)|Richard Salter]]. It was this group of six singers who gave the first concert under the name of the King's Singers on 1 May 1968 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], London, with the [[Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields]], [[Simon Preston]] (organ) and [[Barry Tuckwell]] (horn). Later in 1968, Martin Lane developed a brain tumour and had to withdraw from the group; [[Felicity Palmer]] stood in during 1969 until Nigel Perrin graduated that summer. Then, in 1969, Richard Salter was awarded a Richard Tauber Scholarship and left for Vienna; Nigel Beavan filled the gap until Anthony Holt became available towards the end of the year. Other singers who served as short-term group members were Eleanor Capp, Caryl Newnham and, on one occasion, [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], all of whom took the first countertenor (soprano) role in 1969 when Felicity Palmer was unavailable. For a brief time after he joined the King's Singers, Nigel Perrin also belonged to the Scholars; when double-booked, his King's Singers' duties were fulfilled by Richard Baker (note: not the familiar BBC broadcaster). Neil Jenkins sang tenor in the early pre-King's Singers group's first summer singing tour in 1965, and Peter Hall was another tenor used by the fledgling pre-King's Singers group.<ref name=\"The King's Singers: A Self-Portrait\">{{cite book |title=The King's Singers: A Self-Portrait |last=Singers |first=The King's |year=1980 |publisher=Robson Books |isbn=0-86051-109-X}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingssingers.com/info/about-us/former-singers+8.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615012816/http://www.kingssingers.com/info/about-us/former-singers+8.html |date=15 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===''Madrigal History Tour''===\nIn 1984, the members of the King's Singers (who at the time included two founding members, Alastair Hume and Simon Carrington) presented, narrated and sang in ''Madrigal History Tour'', a six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series about the history of the [[madrigal]] in [[Western Europe]]. (The name was a play on the [[Beatles]] album ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]''.)

It was this serene and precise sound, with vibrato used only as a colour rather than a default setting, that was expanded by the early King's Singers to be used on all genres of music, from renaissance church repertoire such as they had performed as part of the daily chapel services at the university, to pop/jazz/folk/spiritual arrangements that were soon added to their concert programmes.\n\nThe group has also inspired musicians in other countries to create similar ensembles, e.g. [[Affabre Concinui]] in [[Poland]].\n\n==Repertoire==\nThe King's Singers took hold of the idea that concerts need not contain merely one form of music; audiences could be educated as well as entertained. For those who came expecting pop music there would be classical music as well, and vice versa. This started out of necessity; for their first few concerts the group simply had to perform everything they knew in order to fill a concert programme, and this included religious music from their chapel library, along with folksongs and other \"lollipops.\" Over the years their library has expanded so that it now includes some 2,000 works of all styles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The group is best known for its ''a cappella'' performances which have as a foundation a strong bass/baritone blend on which the other voices sit, a principle known as the \"Pyramid of Sound\". They say the \u2018added\u2019 baritone creates more width and depth to their sound. The two baritones and bass allow the top three parts to sit on top of the bed of sound created for them and, given that higher-pitched voices are heard more easily, the effect to the audience is one of complete balance in the overall chordal sound, despite being 'outnumbered' by their lower-pitched colleagues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/in-touch-with-the-kings-singerskings-of-a-capella/|title=In touch with The King\u2019s Singers Kings of A Capella |last=Lee |first=Jenny |date=2014 |website=Interlude |access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref> In addition, the King's Singers have frequently performed with instruments, both in recordings and in concert. One of their most famous songs is \"You Are The New Day.\" They have appeared in many venues, including the famous City Varieties Theatre Leeds, with many appearances on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety programme, ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''. They have also appeared on TV in concert with [[Hinge and Bracket]].\n\n==Concert structure==\nMost of their a cappella concerts are divided into five distinct groups of pieces. The first four vary widely (madrigals, folk songs, recently commissioned pieces, etc.) but are generally taken from the serious side of the group's repertoire, but the last group of the concert is typically a \"[[Close and open harmony|close harmony]]\" set. Often it consists of lighter fare, including music of [[The Beatles]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Harold Arlen]] or [[Irving Berlin]], many of which have been arranged for the group by composers such as [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Jeremy Lubbock]], [[Bob Chilcott]], [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]] and [[John Rutter]]. Sometimes the final set (in a concert of religious music) will be a spiritual harmony set \u2013 entitled \"Songs of Faith and Hope\". This set could be composed of American Spirituals, arranged by contemporary composers, including former group members Philip Lawson and Bob Chilcott. Pieces in this set could include \"[[Simple Gifts]]\", [[Deep River (song)|\"Deep River\"]], \"[[Down to the River to Pray]]\", and \"[[Stand Still]], Jordan\" as well as more spiritual pop songs such as \"Some Folks Lives Roll Easy\" by [[Paul Simon]].\n\nMore recently,{{clarify|date=May 2013}} however, the King's Singers have begun to perform \"concept programmes\" which have a set theme running throughout. These could be simply a 60-minute first-half sequence, often performed in European cathedral concerts, with a Mass or Requiem setting providing the backbone, interspersed with other shorter works, or a more fundamental concept which infuses every piece performed. Examples of this latter art include \"Sacred Bridges\", a programme of Jewish, Islamic and Christian settings of Psalms, performed with Vladimir Ivanoff and his ensemble \"Saraband\". The group have also created concert programmes relating to recent CD recordings, including \"Landscape and Time\" and \"Treason and Dischord\", the latter a programme commemorating the 400th anniversary of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] and including a script read in live performances by actors [[Joss Ackland]] and [[Bill Wallis]]. The group works closely with concert promoters and local agents to determine the best possible programme for each concert, whether for church, concert hall, open-air venue or private house.\n\n==Modern repertoire==\nThe King's Singers are also known for frequently commissioning works from contemporary composers. Starting with \"Timepiece\", commissioned by the Camden Festival in 1972 from composer Paul Patterson (and still regularly performed today), they have continued by commissioning pieces from (amongst others) [[Sally Beamish]], [[Bob Chilcott]], Sir [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Howard Goodall]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Jackson Hill (composer)|Jackson Hill]], [[Graham Lack]], [[Libby Larsen]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]], [[Ivan Moody (composer)|Ivan Moody]], [[Jocelyn Pook]], [[Geoffrey Poole]], [[Francis Pott (composer)|Francis Pott]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Joby Talbot]], Sir [[John Tavener]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]]. In 2008 they performed a piece commissioned jointly for them and the [[National Youth Choirs of Great Britain]] written by [[Eric Whitacre]].\n\n==Awards==\nIn February 2009 the King's Singers' CD, ''Simple Gifts'', won a [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album]]. In February 2012 they won Best Choral Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards along with [[Eric Whitacre]] for the album ''Light and Gold'', on which they performed \"The Stolen Child\", written for the group by Whitacre. Their DVD, \"Live at the BBC Proms\", won a MIDEM Award at the annual ceremony in Cannes in 2010 for Best DVD Performance. In 2013 the group was inducted into the [[Gramophone Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CONGRATULATIONS TO GRAMOPHONE HALL OF FAMERS ANDSNES, FLEMING, ISSERLIS & THE KING\u2019S SINGERS|url=http://imgartists.com/news/congratulations_to_gramophone_hall_of_famers_andsnes_fleming_galway_the_kin/|website=IMG Artists|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Activities of former members==\nMany former members of the King's Singers have remained active in the world of [[Choir|choral music]].

Every two years they hold a residency at the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival in [[L\u00fcbeck]], Germany, at which up to 12 a cappella groups from all over the world are taught over a period of four days, culminating in a public performance. The group also leads around a dozen additional one-off masterclasses throughout the year, normally in conjunction with concert performances and often as part of their twice-yearly US tours. During its time, the King's Singers have taught many groups that have now become known in their own right, such as [[Club for Five]], [[The Real Group]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, [[Rajaton]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, Singer Pur and Calmus Ensemble.\n\nSeveral of the King's Singers also arranged pieces, both for the group and pieces to publish in their line of music. Recently, [[Philip Lawson (singer)|Philip Lawson]] and [[Bob Chilcott]] have been the most prolific composers for the group.\n\nThe group established The King's Singers Summer School in 2013 taking place on campus at Royal Holloway, University of London. The Summer School took place for a second time in 2015 and saw composer and conductor [[Eric Whitacre]] and Eton Choirbook expert Dr. Stephen Darlington as special guests. In 2017, the Summer School participants performed an [[Evensong]] at the [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], under the direction of [[Christopher Robinson (musician)|Christopher Robinson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kingssingers/photos/a.10152252295502904.1073741830.14404452903/10155658264527904/?type=3&theater|title=The King's Singers|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref> The first US Summer School took place between 13\u201319 June 2017 at DePauw University, Indiana followed by the third School at Royal Holloway on 17\u201322 July 2017.

It was their first full-length studio CD since the 1990s. The arrangements on the album are by former first baritone [[Philip Lawson (baritone)|Philip Lawson]], Peter Knight and former tenor [[Bob Chilcott]], and the album was recorded at the home of Francis Rossi, of [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], and engineered by Gregg Jackman, the brother of former King's Singers countertenor [[Jeremy Jackman]]. In February 2009 ''Simple Gifts'' won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Classical Crossover Album. An EP recording, ''From the Heart'', was released in 2010.\n\nIn December 2007, the King's Singers recorded a [[Christmas]] concert, ''[[Rejoice and Be Merry!

The sound on this new album marks a departure from the more acoustic albums of the past decade, using extensive post-production techniques and multi-tracking to create a more modern a cappella sound, but retaining the essence of The King's Singers' blend and balance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+King's Singers albums\n!Disc name\n!Release year\n!Instrumentation / Notes\n!# of a cappella tracks\n!# of tracks\n|-\n|''1605: Treason and Dischord''\n|2005\n|Concordia Viol Consort and Sarah Baldock (organ)\n|7\n|15\n|-\n|''\u00c0 la Fran\u00e7aise''\n|1990\n|Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Carl Davis\n|\n|\n|-\n|''All at Once Well Met''\n|1987\n|Lute and Tabor\n|29\n|35\n|-\n|''America''\n|1989, 2006\n|[[English Chamber Orchestra]]\n|0\n|10\n|-\n|''Annie Laurie''\n|1993\n|Guitar, Flute, Piccolo\n|7\n|18\n|-\n|''The [[Beatles]] Connection''\n|1986\n|\n|19\n|19\n|-\n|''By Appointment'' (aka ''Encore'')\n|1971\n|The [[Gordon Langford]] Trio\n|5\n|13\n|-\n|''Capella'' (compilation)\n|2003\n|\n|\n|41\n|-\n|''Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo; Holy Moses''\n|1972, 2005\n|Drums: [[Alf Bigden]], keyboard: [[Steve Gray (musician)|Steve Gray]], bass: Brian Odges (Holy Moses)\n|0\n|18\n|-\n|''Chanson d'amour''\n|1993\n|\n|11\n|21\n|-\n|''Christmas''\n|2003\n|String Quartet and Drums\n|23\n|25\n|-\n|''Circle of Life''\n|1997\n|[[Metropole Orchestra|Metropole Orkest]]\n|3\n|12\n|-\n|''Colouring Book''\n|2005\n|\n|\n|18\n|-\n|''Contemporary Collection''\n|1975\n|Double bass\n|\n|5\n|-\n|''Courtly Pleasures''\n|1973\n|[[Early Music Consort]] of London, [[David Munrow]]\n|\n|22\n|-\n|''Deck the Hall \u2013 Songs for Christmas''\n|1973, 1991\n|\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|''English & Italian Madrigals''\n|1974, 1989\n|(reissue of ''King's Singers Madrigal Collection'')\n|21\n|21\n|-\n|''English Renaissance''\n|1995\n|\n|20\n|20\n|-\n|''Fire~Water''\n|2000\n|[[Andrew Lawrence-King]], [[The Harp Consort]]\n|\n|17\n|-\n|''A French Collection''\n|1973\n|[[Early Music Consort]] of London, [[David Munrow]]\n|\n|16\n|-\n|''Gesualdo: Tenebrae Responses for [[Maundy Thursday]]''\n|2004\n|\n|14\n|14\n|-\n|''Get Happy!''\n|1991\n|[[George Shearing]] (piano), [[Neil Swainson]] (double bass), [[John Harle]] (saxophone)\n|3\n|17\n|-\n|''The Golden Age \u2013 Siglo de Oro''\n|2008\n|Keith McGowan\n|\n|10\n|-\n|''Good Vibrations''\n|1993\n|\n|13\n|13\n|-\n|''Great American Songbook''\n|2013\n|\n|17\n|17\n|-\n|''Here's a Howdy Do!''\n|1993\n|Sound Effects, Organ, Piano, Double Bass, Drums\n|11\n|15\n|-\n|''High Flight''\n|2011\n|The Concordia Choir\n|13\n|14\n|-\n|''In Memoriam Josquin Desprez'' (compilation)\n|2012\n|\n|13\n|13\n|-\n\n|''De Janequin aux Beatles'' (compilation)\n|1999\n|Various\n|\n|55\n|-\n|''Joy to the World''\n|2011\n|\n|18\n|18\n|-\n|''Kids' Stuff''\n|1986, 2000\n|[[Judi Dench]], Various\n|\n|14\n|-\n|''Keep on Changing''\n|1975\n|\n|12\n|12\n|-\n|''The King's Singers Madrigal Collection''\n|1974\n|\n|21\n|21\n|-\n|''The King's Singers Original Debut Recording''\n|1971, 1992\n|The [[Gordon Langford]] Trio (reissue of ''By Appointment'')\n|5\n|13\n|-\n|''The King\u2019s Singers sing Flanders & Swann and Noel Coward''\n|1977\n|\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|''Landscape & Time''\n|2006\n|\n|11\n|11\n|-\n|''Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti Edition, Vol. 4 (Vocal Works)''\n|1997\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|''A Little Christmas Music''\n|1989\n|[[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[City of London Sinfonia]]\n|7\n|20\n|-\n|''Lollipops''\n|1975\n|\n|11\n|11\n|-\n|''Madrigal History Tour''\n|1984, 1989\n|Consort of Musicke\n|0\n|34\n|-\n|''My Spirit Sang All Day''\n|1988\n|\n|25\n|25\n|-\n|''Nana's book of songs''\n|1974\n|Nana Mouskouri, orchestra\n|\n|10\n|-\n|''New Day''\n|1980\n|\n|9\n|15\n|-\n|''Nightsong''\n|1997\n|Various\n|5\n|15\n|-\n|''Out of the Blue''\n|1974\n|Instrumental ensemble\n|\n|12\n|-\n|''Pater Noster: A Choral Reflection on the Lord's Prayer''\n|2012\n|\n|25\n|25\n|-\n|''Postcards''\n|2014\n|\n|22\n|22\n|-\n|''The Quiet Heart \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.1''\n|2006\n|\n|19\n|19\n|-\n|''Reflections \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.2''\n|2008\n|\n|20\n|20\n|-\n|''In This Quiet Moment \u2013 Choral Essays Vol.3''\n|2010\n|\n|18\n|18\n|-\n|''[[Rejoice and Be Merry!
