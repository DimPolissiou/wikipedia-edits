They entered the season as the defending [[Super Bowl]] champions, after winning [[Super Bowl LIII]], and as three-time defending [[American Football Conference|AFC]] champions. The Patriots won the [[AFC East]] for the 11th straight season, and improved on their 11\u20135 record from [[2018 New England Patriots season|the previous season]], but they were [[Upset (sports)|upset]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nCatalyzed by their defense's historically dominant play, the Patriots started the season extremely well at 8\u20130 for the third time in franchise history, and early on there was conversation as to if they could repeat the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots|2007 regular season]]. However, their winning streak would soon end as a result of their Week 9 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], which was also their first loss to the Ravens since the January 20, 2013 AFC Championship Game. In Week 12, the Patriots set a new NFL record with their 17th consecutive 10-win season, surpassing the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who set the original record of 16 consecutive 10-win seasons from 1983\u20131998.\n\nFor the first time since [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], the team's former starting [[tight end]], was not on the active roster as he announced his retirement on March 24, 2019.<ref name=\"Bergman\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001024012/article/patriots-te-rob-gronkowski-announces-retirement |title=Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski announces retirement |first=Jeremy |last=Bergman |website=NFL.com |date=March 24, 2019 |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref> Also, for the first time since [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]], the Patriots had a different kicker on the regular season roster as the struggling [[Stephen Gostkowski]] was placed on [[Injured reserve|IR]]; he was replaced by midseason signings [[Mike Nugent]],<ref name=\"MnugG\">{{cite web|last=Ulrich|first=Logan|url=https://nfltraderumors.co/patriots-signing-k-mike-nugent/|title=Patriots Signing K Mike Nugent|accessdate=October 3, 2019|date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Nick Folk]],<ref name=\"FolKNic\">{{cite web |title=Report: Patriots Sign Nick Folk As New Kicker |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/10/29/patriots-news-nick-folk-kicker-signing/ |website=Boston.CBSLocal.com |publisher=CBS Boston |accessdate=October 29, 2019|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> and [[Kai Forbath]].\n\nWith their win over the [[2019 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] in Week 16, the Patriots clinched the AFC East for the 11th consecutive year. However, despite entering December at 10\u20131, the Patriots failed to clinch a first round bye for the first time since [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009]] thanks to a late-season collapse that was epitomized by a 27\u201324 loss to the 4\u201311 [[2019 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] followed by a 31\u201321 [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] victory over the [[2019 Los Angeles Chargers season|Chargers]] in Week 17. It was their first home loss to the Dolphins since [[2008 New England Patriots season|2008]] and their first since [[2005 New England Patriots season|2005]] with [[Tom Brady]] as starting quarterback.\n\nIn their first Wild Card game since the [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009 season]], the Patriots lost to the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] 20\u201313. It was the first time since [[2012 New England Patriots season|2012]] the Patriots lost a home playoff game, the first time the Patriots failed to reach the Divisional round since [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009]], the first time they went one and done in the playoffs and missed the [[AFC Championship game]] since [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]], and also the first time since [[2015 New England Patriots season|2015]] they failed to reach the [[Super Bowl]].<ref>https://nesn.com/2020/01/what-went-wrong-in-patriots-20-13-wild-card-round-loss-to-titans/</ref>\n\nThis was also [[Tom Brady]]\u2019s last season with the team, as he announced he was entering free agency and later signed with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on March 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Tom Brady officially signs contract with Buccaneers|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001107130/article/tom-brady-officially-signs-contract-with-buccaneers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Scott|title=All in!

The first drives ended in punts for both teams, but on the Patriots' second possession, they managed to race down the field on a seven-play, 82-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to [[Josh Gordon]], in which he broke two tackles after the catch. After forcing the Steelers to go three-and-out, due in part to a holding call on [[Alejandro Villanueva (American football)|Alejandro Villanueva]], the Patriots marched down the field, only for the drive to stall at the Pittsburgh 7-yard line, and the Patriots were forced to settle for a field goal, now leading 10\u20130 in the second quarter. New England went three-and-out on their following drive but scored on a 25-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]] thereafter. In the Patriots' last possession of the first half, even with good field position, they failed to capitalize with a touchdown, settling for another field goal. Beginning the second half, the Patriots led 20\u20130. This lasted only briefly, as their defense gave up three points on the Steelers' first drive of the third quarter. [[Tom Brady]] and the offense responded quickly with a 58-yard pass to Dorsett, his second touchdown catch of the game. On their subsequent possessions, the Patriots scored field goals.

After forcing the Dolphins to go three-and-out, the Patriots countered with a drive in which [[Tom Brady]] targeted newly acquired [[wide receiver]] [[Antonio Brown]] three times for gains of 18, 10, and 8 yards. They finished the possession with a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Sony Michel]]. The next three drives ended in punts. Though, on the first, [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] was sacked by [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]] on third down just after reaching midfield. On the Patriots' ensuing possession, they drove to the Dolphins 30 but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed the first of a number of field goals that day. Despite the offense's lack of scoring, the New England defense played stoutly, forcing Miami to go three-and-out on their next two drives. The Patriots scored on a 65-yard possession that ended with a 20-yard pass from Tom Brady to Antonio Brown. Gostkowski missed the extra point and the Patriots led 13\u20130. In the second half, the New England offense failed to advance on their first drive. Meanwhile, Ryan Fitzpatrick was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. Now, with great field position, at the Miami 36, the Patriots failed to take advantage and were forced to settle for a field goal. The Dolphins' offense was unable to make anything of their next two drives going three-and-out on both while obtaining \u22122 yards and \u221211 yards on their first and second respectively. The Patriots offense made the best of their defense's solid play, marching down the field on an eight-play, 65-yard possession which ended with a 1-yard QB sneak by Brady. Later, New England's defense continued its sensational performance by forcing Miami to go three-and-out yet again. Upon entering the third quarter, Miami's offense had amassed a mere 28 yards. The Patriots' offense struggled, however, being unable to obtain a first-down. This proved irrelevant as the New England defense had pick-sixes on back-to-back drives: [[Stephon Gilmore]] returned the first 54-yards after a bad decision by Fitzpatrick and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] returned the second 69-yards after a dropped pass. The Patriots now led 37\u20130. Ryan Fitzpatrick was replaced by backup [[Josh Rosen]] on the ensuing drive. The Patriots scored another touchdown on a 10-yard reception by [[James White (running back)|James White]]. On Miami's final possession, they marched 67-yards to the New England 8 but failed to score due to an interception by Jamie Collins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Patriots' first win in Miami since Week 17 of the [[2016 New England Patriots season|2016 season]], and their first shutout since Week 3 of that same season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goss |first1=Nick |title=Bill Belichick sums up Patriots' shutout win vs. Dolphins with classic line |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/bill-belichick-sums-patriots-shutout-win-vs-dolphins-classic-line |website=NBCSports.com |accessdate=September 15, 2019|date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, New England's defense held the Dolphins' offense to just 184 yards and forced four turnovers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Team Statistics \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref> By holding the Dolphins to 0 points and the Steelers to 3 points a week prior, the defense made history, in fact, it tied the record for fewest points allowed through two games during the Super Bowl era.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camenker |first1=James |title=Patriots defense make NFL history with performance through two games |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/patriots-defense-make-nfl-history-performance-through-two-games |website=NBCSports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=September 20, 2019|date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> After much speculation over whether [[Antonio Brown]] would debut against the Dolphins as a result of his rape lawsuit, he indeed started and had four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchmasser |first1=Bernd |title=Patriots vs Dolphins snap count report: Joe Thuney's iron man streak comes to an end; Antonio Brown plays 23 snaps |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/9/16/20868097/new-england-patriots-miami-dolphins-snap-count-report-joe-thuney-iron-man-streak-comes-to-an-end |website=PatsPulpit.com |publisher=Pats Pulpit |accessdate=September 16, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> This proved to be to Brown's sole game with the Patriots as he was released days later on September 20, as a result of his response to further allegations.<ref name=\"ABrownRelease\" />\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Three: New York Jets at New England Patriots&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 22\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|road=Jets\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n|home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=13|H2=7|H3=10|H4=0\n|stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|attendance=65,878\n|weather=Sunny and warm, {{convert|81|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Harlan]], [[Rich Gannon]] and [[Dana Jacobson]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019092206/2019/REG3/jets@patriots Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57939/NE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Sony Michel]] 5-yard run (kick failed, wide right), 7:55.

Continuing his struggles on [[special teams]], [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed his third extra-point of the year. On the Jets\u2019 ensuing drive, they went three-and-out as a result of a sack by [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]]. Meanwhile, New Englands\u2019 offense would score yet another touchdown, this time on a 25-yard catch-and-run by [[Phillip Dorsett]]. New York's offense failed to obtain any first-downs for the rest of the first half, and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]]. Although, the rest of their drives ended in punts. Entering the second half, New England led 20\u20130. The Patriots started with the ball but were unable to reach midfield and were forced to punt. On the following drive, Luke Falk threw an underthrown [[interception]] to [[Devin McCourty]] which was returned 24-yards to the New York 17. Unfortunately, the Patriots were unable to take advantage and settled for a 37-yard field goal. The defense would still play stoutly, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their ensuing drive, caused, in part, by a holding penalty on [[Kelechi Osemele]]. The Patriots countered with a 10-play, 60-yard drive which ended with a 2-yard rush touchdown by [[Rex Burkhead]], leading 30\u20130. Notably, [[Josh Gordon]] caught a spectacular 28-yard reception on third and 22, saving the drive from stalling and entering the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. On New York's next drive, they managed the reach near midfield but the drive was halted by a sack by [[Dont'a Hightower]] and [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]]. The punt would prove disastrous for New England as [[rookie]] [[Gunner Olszewski]] muffed the ball and [[Arthur Maulet]], of the Jets, recovered it in the [[end zone]] for a touchdown: this was the first touchdown the Patriots had allowed all season. The ensuing two drives ended in punts. Although, on the Patriots' subsequent possession thereafter, Tom Brady was substituted by rookie [[Jarrett Stidham]] with 8:41 left in the fourth. Stidham threw a badly missed pass which was intercepted by [[Jamal Adams]] and returned 61 yards for a touchdown.

The Patriots began with the ball and started well with a 15-yard rush by [[Sony Michel]] on the first play. Though the drive faltered thereafter and they were forced to punt. In contrast, the defense maintained its tremendous play by intercepting [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] on the Bills' first drive; [[Devin McCourty]] claimed his fourth pick of the season. Taking advantage of the turnover, New England's offense marched 50 yards down the field for a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Brandon Bolden]]. Tom Brady also threw a catch-and-run pass to [[James White (running back)|James White]] for 26 yards despite great coverage by [[Matt Milano]]. On the extra point attempt, [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed yet another extra point, his fourth of the season. On the ensuing possession, the Bills struggled to obtain yards and went three-and-out. On the resulting punt, [[J. C. Jackson]] blocked [[Corey Bojorquez]]'s kick which was recovered and returned by [[Matthew Slater]] for a touchdown to put the Patriots up 13\u20130. Both teams' offenses failed to reach midfield and punted on the next two drives. However, on the possession after that, Josh Allen threw another pick, which was intercepted by J. C. Jackson. Without much momentum and at their own 25, New England went three-and-out, although Buffalo went three-and-out as well. Now at their own 5-yard line, the Patriots offense finally managed an effective drive for once. They drove 93 yards to the Buffalo 2-yard line, but the drive stalled and Brady threw a terrible pick to [[Micah Hyde (American football)|Micah Hyde]] in the endzone. Buffalo capitalized with a 46-yard field goal by [[Stephen Hauschka]]. Unable to counter, New England went three-and-out once more and the Bills drove to the New England 31 but failed to score as Hauschka missed a 49-yard field goal with time running out in the first half. Entering the second half, the Patriots led 13\u20133. The Bills' first drive was very effective as they marched 75 yards down the field and scored on a 1-yard QB sneak by Allen. This was the first touchdown allowed by the Patriots' defense all season. On the subsequent three possessions, both offenses only experienced only three-and-outs. Afterward, J. C. Jackson intercepted Josh Allen for his second pick of the day. Even with great field position at the Buffalo 42, the Patriots only managed to reach the Buffalo 4-yard line where they settled for a field goal. Josh Allen was concussed from a hit by [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] on the ensuing drive while he attempted to scramble for a first down. Allen would be replaced by backup [[Matt Barkley]] who continued to lead the offense to the New England 3-yard line where the Bills failed to score on 4th-and-goal. Both teams' offenses were unable to create any effective drives after this point. Nonetheless, Buffalo's offense managed to reach midfield on their final possession but Matt Barkley threw an easy interception to [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] as a result of pressure from [[Kyle Van Noy]]. This pick clinched the game for New England and they won 16\u201310.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patriots vs. Bills \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 29, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127866 |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Patriots overcame the Bills, this proved to be an extremely sloppy game for their offense, as [[Tom Brady]] recorded his first interception of the year at the Buffalo 2-yard line and a completion rate under 50%, having gone 18 of 39. New England's offense went a mere 5/18 on third down conversions and only obtained 11 first-downs.

Initially, both teams traded punts, but on the succeeding possession, Patriots' defenders missed numerous tackles and Washington scored on a 65-yard run by [[Steven Sims]]. This was the first time the Patriots had trailed all season. However, New England responded quickly with a no-huddle offense and marched 75 yards, scoring on a 6-yard catch by [[Julian Edelman]]. On the extra-point, newly signed [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Nugent]] missed the kick, his first as a Patriot. Washington's next drive was halted by a sack from [[Danny Shelton]]. Neither team could reach midfield on any of the remaining possessions of the first quarter. With the Patriots' first drive in the second, they raced down the field to the Washington 19, but were stalled and forced to settle for a 37-yard field goal. Both teams went three-and-out on their next drives. Although, on the possession thereafter, [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] forced a fumble on [[Trey Quinn]] and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] recovered. New England's offense failed to score despite being in the redzone, as [[Tom Brady]] threw an awful interception to [[Montae Nicholson]]. Even with this turnover, the Redskins offense lacked momentum and failed to advance. On the next Washington possession, [[Colt McCoy]] was picked by [[Jason McCourty]]. At the Washington 11-yard line, the Patriots went three-and-out and settled for a field goal with the score being 12\u20137 at the end of the first half. With the passing game being mostly unreliable, New England's offense began relying on and utilizing its running game far more. This proved vital as the Patriots advanced rapidly behind [[Sony Michel]]'s rushing attack and they scored on a 29-yard pass to [[Brandon Bolden]]. On the ensuing New England drive, they would score on a 14-yard run by Michel. Both teams exchanged punts for the rest of the game and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 10-yard pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] in a 10-play, 58-yard possession.

Starting with the ball, New England had a slow start on offense. [[Sony Michel]] rushed for 10-yards on the first play, but the drive would soon stall. Cleveland went three-and-out on their first possession; and on the ensuing Patriots possession, they reached the Browns' 2 but were forced to settle for a field goal. They would score again after [[Kyle Van Noy]] returned 26-yard fumble \u2013 in which [[Nick Chubb]] lost the ball after his own lineman's foot knocked it loose -for a touchdown. Notably during the kickoff, [[rookie]] [[Punter (football)|punter]] [[Jake Bailey]] completed his first kick as the replacement for the recently injured [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. Surprisingly, Chubb, on the Browns' next drive, would fumble again after rushing past New England defenders to the Patriots 16 and [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] striking the ball out. The Patriots would soon punt after gaining possession. On Cleveland's first play, [[Baker Mayfield]] threw a shovel pass pick to [[Lawrence Guy]] who returned it to the Browns' 11. [[Tom Brady]] would hit [[Julian Edelman]] on an 8-yard touchdown, two plays later. Finally ending their streak of turnovers, the Browns reached midfield and punted. New England would go three-and-out on the next possession, and the Browns responded with a 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Demetrius Harris]] in an 8 play, 54 yard drive. Seeking to counter, New England attempted a field goal at the Browns 11, but it was blocked by [[Denzel Ward]]. Entering the second half, the Patriots were leading 17\u20137. On the first possession, Cleveland marched to the New England 11, however, a [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] sack halted their advance. The Patriots answered with a touchdown. During the drive, [[James White (running back)|James White]] recorded a 59-yard catch-and-run on a screen and Brady connected with Edelman for their second touchdown of the day. Both teams traded punts for the rest of the third quarter. New England would manage to reach the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] once again, but yet another possession was hampered, and they obtained a field goal. After a series of sacks and penalties on Cleveland, their drive lost momentum immediately and they failed to convert on 4th and 16 at their own 19. The Patriots sought to capitalize off the stop, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed his field goal wide left in what was his last game as a Patriots; he was cut from the team just days later. The Browns would score a field goal on the following possession and neither team would gain anything in particular thereafter.

In the first drive of the game, the Ravens converted twice on 3rd down. 7 of the Ravens plays in the first drive were runs by Lamar Jackson, Mark Ingram, and Gus Edwards. On 3rd down the patriots supposedly held the Ravens to a field goal but a neutral zone infraction by Shilque Calhoun have the Ravens a first down which led to a 3-yard rushing touchdown by quarterback Lamar Jackson. On the Patriots first possession Tom Brady threw 3 straight incomplete passes which led to a punt. The next drive the Patriots defense showed improvement holding the Ravens to a field goal. The Patriots however did not improve offensively as they had to punt after a 9-yard sack by Patrick Onwuasor. After the first quarter the Ravens led 10\u20130\n\nThe next drive was capitalized by a 53-yard rush by Mark Ingram which was finished with a 12-yard rushing touchdown by Gus Edwards which pushed the Ravens lead 17\u20130. The Patriots once again failed to score after another 3 and out but they caught a break after former Patriot Cyrus Jones muffed a punt by Jake Bailey recovered by newly acquired special teamer Justin Bethel at the Baltimore 20 yard line. This led to a touchdown by newly acquired receiver Mohammed Sanu to become the 74th player to catch a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. After a 3 and out by the Ravens. The Patriots did well on the offensive side of the ball but holding by Marshall Newhouse and intentional grounding prevented the Patriots from scoring leading to a punt. The Patriots were set up in good field position after a fumble recovered by Lawrence Guy at the Ravens 19 yard line. The Patriots reached the Baltimore 4 yard line but failed to convert on 3rd which led to a field goal making the game 10\u201317. The Ravens punted as the Patriots reached the Baltimore 1 yard line as a touchdown by James White was reversed. A somewhat controversial decision by Belichick was made as they had a chance to tie the game on 4th and Goal at the 1 but decided to take a field goal instead to make it 13\u201317 as the half ended shortly after.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd quarter the Patriots advanced to the Baltimore 30 led by receptions of 11 and 15 yards by Mohammed Sanu. A fumble by Julian Edelman which was returned 70 yards by Marlon Humphrey for a touchdown to advance the Ravens lead to 24\u201313 which was seen as a momentum killer by fans after the game. The next drive the Patriots scored after a 4-yard rushing touchdown on 3rd and 3 by James White to keep it a 1 score game. The next drive the Ravens scored with an 8:09 drive and 14 plays with 16 and 18 yard receptions by Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews. The Ravens scored with a 5-yard pass to Nick Boyle to make the lead 30\u201320 with a missed PAT by Justin Tucker.\n\nIn the 4th quarter down two scores the Patriots threw an interception to Earl Thomas which ultimately killed any chance of winning for the Patriots as Lamar Jackson ran for a 1-yard touchdown after a 14 play drive to put the icing on the cake for a 37\u201320 lead. The game was viewed as an impressive win by the Ravens as Lamar Jackson became a front runner for MVP after a defeat of one of the best teams in the NFL.\n\nThis was the Patriots' first loss since December 16, 2018 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

They entered the season as the defending [[Super Bowl]] champions, after winning [[Super Bowl LIII]], and as three-time defending [[American Football Conference|AFC]] champions. The Patriots won the [[AFC East]] for the 11th straight season, and improved on their 11\u20135 record from [[2018 New England Patriots season|the previous season]], but they were [[Upset (sports)|upset]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nCatalyzed by their defense's historically dominant play, the Patriots started the season extremely well at 8\u20130 for the third time in franchise history, and early on there was conversation as to if they could repeat the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots|2007 regular season]]. However, their winning streak would soon end as a result of their Week 9 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], which was also their first loss to the Ravens since the January 20, 2013 AFC Championship Game. In Week 12, the Patriots set a new NFL record with their 17th consecutive 10-win season, surpassing the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who set the original record of 16 consecutive 10-win seasons from 1983\u20131998.\n\nFor the first time since [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], the team's former starting [[tight end]], was not on the active roster as he announced his retirement on March 24, 2019.<ref name=\"Bergman\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001024012/article/patriots-te-rob-gronkowski-announces-retirement |title=Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski announces retirement |first=Jeremy |last=Bergman |website=NFL.com |date=March 24, 2019 |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref> Also, for the first time since [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]], the Patriots had a different kicker on the regular season roster as the struggling [[Stephen Gostkowski]] was placed on [[Injured reserve|IR]]; he was replaced by midseason signings [[Mike Nugent]],<ref name=\"MnugG\">{{cite web|last=Ulrich|first=Logan|url=https://nfltraderumors.co/patriots-signing-k-mike-nugent/|title=Patriots Signing K Mike Nugent|accessdate=October 3, 2019|date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Nick Folk]],<ref name=\"FolKNic\">{{cite web |title=Report: Patriots Sign Nick Folk As New Kicker |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/10/29/patriots-news-nick-folk-kicker-signing/ |website=Boston.CBSLocal.com |publisher=CBS Boston |accessdate=October 29, 2019|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> and [[Kai Forbath]].\n\nWith their win over the [[2019 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] in Week 16, the Patriots clinched the AFC East for the 11th consecutive year.

The first drives ended in punts for both teams, but on the Patriots' second possession, they managed to race down the field on a seven-play, 82-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to [[Josh Gordon]], in which he broke two tackles after the catch. After forcing the Steelers to go three-and-out, due in part to a holding call on [[Alejandro Villanueva (American football)|Alejandro Villanueva]], the Patriots marched down the field, only for the drive to stall at the Pittsburgh 7-yard line, and the Patriots were forced to settle for a field goal, now leading 10\u20130 in the second quarter. New England went three-and-out on their following drive but scored on a 25-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]] thereafter. In the Patriots' last possession of the first half, even with good field position, they failed to capitalize with a touchdown, settling for another field goal. Beginning the second half, the Patriots led 20\u20130. This lasted only briefly, as their defense gave up three points on the Steelers' first drive of the third quarter. [[Tom Brady]] and the offense responded quickly with a 58-yard pass to Dorsett, his second touchdown catch of the game. On their subsequent possessions, the Patriots scored field goals. Meanwhile, [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. In Pittsburgh's final drive, they managed to advance 50 yards down the field, but failed to score with time running out. Ultimately, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 33\u20133, starting 1\u20130 for the season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steelers vs. Patriots \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 8, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127860 |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBeginning his 20th season in the league, [[Tom Brady]] finished the game with 341 yards and three touchdowns,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golen |first1=Jimmy |title=Tom Brady starts his 20th season by routing Steelers 33\u20133 |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2019/09/08/tom-brady-patriots-steelers-opener |website=Boston.com |accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> while [[Julian Edelman]] recorded his 500th reception with the Patriots, becoming the fifth player to reach that milestone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DePrisco |first1=Michael |title=Julian Edelman becomes fifth player to record 500 receptions with Patriots |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/julian-edelman-becomes-fifth-player-014118235.html |website=Yahoo.com |accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> [[Phillip Dorsett]] had a spectacular game, leading the Patriots in receiving yards and touchdowns, catching four passes on four targets for 95 yards and two touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kyed |first1=Doug |title=Phillip Dorsett Shows Why He\u2019s Perfect Patriots Reserve Receiver In Win |url=https://nesn.com/2019/09/phillip-dorsett-showed-why-hes-perfect-patriots-reserve-receiver-in-week-1/ |website=NESN.com |accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Josh Gordon]] had three receptions for 73 yards in his first game since Week 13 of the [[2018 New England Patriots season|2018 season]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchmasser |first1=Bernd |title=The Tom Brady-Josh Gordon connection is picking up right where it left off |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/9/9/20856630/tom-brady-josh-gordon-connection-picking-up-right-where-it-left-off-new-england-patriots-steelers |website=PatsPulpit.com |accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> Moreover, the Patriots defense played well, holding the Steelers to 308 yards and just three points.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steelers vs. Patriots \u2013 Team Statistics \u2013 September 8, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401127860 |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Week 2: at Miami Dolphins====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Two: New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 15\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|road='''Patriots'''\n|R1=7|R2=6|R3=10|R4=20\n|home=Dolphins\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=[[Hard Rock Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n|attendance=65,513\n|weather=Mostly cloudy, {{convert|87|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Ian Eagle]], [[Dan Fouts]] and [[Evan Washburn]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019091505/2019/REG2/patriots@dolphins Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57922/MIA_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Sony Michel]] 1-yard run ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 7:46.

After forcing the Dolphins to go three-and-out, the Patriots countered with a drive in which [[Tom Brady]] targeted newly acquired [[wide receiver]] [[Antonio Brown]] three times for gains of 18, 10, and 8 yards. They finished the possession with a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Sony Michel]]. The next three drives ended in punts. Though, on the first, [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] was sacked by [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]] on third down just after reaching midfield. On the Patriots' ensuing possession, they drove to the Dolphins 30 but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed the first of a number of field goals that day. Despite the offense's lack of scoring, the New England defense played stoutly, forcing Miami to go three-and-out on their next two drives. The Patriots scored on a 65-yard possession that ended with a 20-yard pass from Tom Brady to Antonio Brown. Gostkowski missed the extra point and the Patriots led 13\u20130. In the second half, the New England offense failed to advance on their first drive. Meanwhile, Ryan Fitzpatrick was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. Now, with great field position, at the Miami 36, the Patriots failed to take advantage and were forced to settle for a field goal. The Dolphins' offense was unable to make anything of their next two drives going three-and-out on both while obtaining \u22122 yards and \u221211 yards on their first and second respectively. The Patriots offense made the best of their defense's solid play, marching down the field on an eight-play, 65-yard possession which ended with a 1-yard QB sneak by Brady. Later, New England's defense continued its sensational performance by forcing Miami to go three-and-out yet again. Upon entering the third quarter, Miami's offense had amassed a mere 28 yards. The Patriots' offense struggled, however, being unable to obtain a first-down. This proved irrelevant as the New England defense had pick-sixes on back-to-back drives: [[Stephon Gilmore]] returned the first 54-yards after a bad decision by Fitzpatrick and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] returned the second 69-yards after a dropped pass. The Patriots now led 37\u20130. Ryan Fitzpatrick was replaced by backup [[Josh Rosen]] on the ensuing drive. The Patriots scored another touchdown on a 10-yard reception by [[James White (running back)|James White]]. On Miami's final possession, they marched 67-yards to the New England 8 but failed to score due to an interception by Jamie Collins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Patriots' first win in Miami since Week 17 of the [[2016 New England Patriots season|2016 season]], and their first shutout since Week 3 of that same season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goss |first1=Nick |title=Bill Belichick sums up Patriots' shutout win vs. Dolphins with classic line |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/bill-belichick-sums-patriots-shutout-win-vs-dolphins-classic-line |website=NBCSports.com |accessdate=September 15, 2019|date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, New England's defense held the Dolphins' offense to just 184 yards and forced four turnovers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Team Statistics \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref> By holding the Dolphins to 0 points and the Steelers to 3 points a week prior, the defense made history, in fact, it tied the record for fewest points allowed through two games during the Super Bowl era.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camenker |first1=James |title=Patriots defense make NFL history with performance through two games |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/patriots-defense-make-nfl-history-performance-through-two-games |website=NBCSports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=September 20, 2019|date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> After much speculation over whether [[Antonio Brown]] would debut against the Dolphins as a result of his rape lawsuit, he indeed started and had four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchmasser |first1=Bernd |title=Patriots vs Dolphins snap count report: Joe Thuney's iron man streak comes to an end; Antonio Brown plays 23 snaps |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/9/16/20868097/new-england-patriots-miami-dolphins-snap-count-report-joe-thuney-iron-man-streak-comes-to-an-end |website=PatsPulpit.com |publisher=Pats Pulpit |accessdate=September 16, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> This proved to be to Brown's sole game with the Patriots as he was released days later on September 20, as a result of his response to further allegations.<ref name=\"ABrownRelease\" />\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Three: New York Jets at New England Patriots&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 22\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|road=Jets\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n|home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=13|H2=7|H3=10|H4=0\n|stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|attendance=65,878\n|weather=Sunny and warm, {{convert|81|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Harlan]], [[Rich Gannon]] and [[Dana Jacobson]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019092206/2019/REG3/jets@patriots Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57939/NE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Sony Michel]] 5-yard run (kick failed, wide right), 7:55.

Meanwhile, New Englands\u2019 offense would score yet another touchdown, this time on a 25-yard catch-and-run by [[Phillip Dorsett]]. New York's offense failed to obtain any first-downs for the rest of the first half, and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]]. Although, the rest of their drives ended in punts. Entering the second half, New England led 20\u20130. The Patriots started with the ball but were unable to reach midfield and were forced to punt. On the following drive, Luke Falk threw an underthrown [[interception]] to [[Devin McCourty]] which was returned 24-yards to the New York 17. Unfortunately, the Patriots were unable to take advantage and settled for a 37-yard field goal. The defense would still play stoutly, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their ensuing drive, caused, in part, by a holding penalty on [[Kelechi Osemele]]. The Patriots countered with a 10-play, 60-yard drive which ended with a 2-yard rush touchdown by [[Rex Burkhead]], leading 30\u20130. Notably, [[Josh Gordon]] caught a spectacular 28-yard reception on third and 22, saving the drive from stalling and entering the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. On New York's next drive, they managed the reach near midfield but the drive was halted by a sack by [[Dont'a Hightower]] and [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]]. The punt would prove disastrous for New England as [[rookie]] [[Gunner Olszewski]] muffed the ball and [[Arthur Maulet]], of the Jets, recovered it in the [[end zone]] for a touchdown: this was the first touchdown the Patriots had allowed all season. The ensuing two drives ended in punts. Although, on the Patriots' subsequent possession thereafter, Tom Brady was substituted by rookie [[Jarrett Stidham]] with 8:41 left in the fourth. Stidham threw a badly missed pass which was intercepted by [[Jamal Adams]] and returned 61 yards for a touchdown.

The Patriots began with the ball and started well with a 15-yard rush by [[Sony Michel]] on the first play. Though the drive faltered thereafter and they were forced to punt. In contrast, the defense maintained its tremendous play by intercepting [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] on the Bills' first drive; [[Devin McCourty]] claimed his fourth pick of the season. Taking advantage of the turnover, New England's offense marched 50 yards down the field for a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Brandon Bolden]]. Tom Brady also threw a catch-and-run pass to [[James White (running back)|James White]] for 26 yards despite great coverage by [[Matt Milano]]. On the extra point attempt, [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed yet another extra point, his fourth of the season. On the ensuing possession, the Bills struggled to obtain yards and went three-and-out. On the resulting punt, [[J. C. Jackson]] blocked [[Corey Bojorquez]]'s kick which was recovered and returned by [[Matthew Slater]] for a touchdown to put the Patriots up 13\u20130. Both teams' offenses failed to reach midfield and punted on the next two drives. However, on the possession after that, Josh Allen threw another pick, which was intercepted by J. C. Jackson. Without much momentum and at their own 25, New England went three-and-out, although Buffalo went three-and-out as well. Now at their own 5-yard line, the Patriots offense finally managed an effective drive for once. They drove 93 yards to the Buffalo 2-yard line, but the drive stalled and Brady threw a terrible pick to [[Micah Hyde (American football)|Micah Hyde]] in the endzone. Buffalo capitalized with a 46-yard field goal by [[Stephen Hauschka]]. Unable to counter, New England went three-and-out once more and the Bills drove to the New England 31 but failed to score as Hauschka missed a 49-yard field goal with time running out in the first half. Entering the second half, the Patriots led 13\u20133. The Bills' first drive was very effective as they marched 75 yards down the field and scored on a 1-yard QB sneak by Allen. This was the first touchdown allowed by the Patriots' defense all season. On the subsequent three possessions, both offenses only experienced only three-and-outs. Afterward, J. C. Jackson intercepted Josh Allen for his second pick of the day. Even with great field position at the Buffalo 42, the Patriots only managed to reach the Buffalo 4-yard line where they settled for a field goal. Josh Allen was concussed from a hit by [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] on the ensuing drive while he attempted to scramble for a first down. Allen would be replaced by backup [[Matt Barkley]] who continued to lead the offense to the New England 3-yard line where the Bills failed to score on 4th-and-goal. Both teams' offenses were unable to create any effective drives after this point. Nonetheless, Buffalo's offense managed to reach midfield on their final possession but Matt Barkley threw an easy interception to [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] as a result of pressure from [[Kyle Van Noy]]. This pick clinched the game for New England and they won 16\u201310.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patriots vs. Bills \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 29, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127866 |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Patriots overcame the Bills, this proved to be an extremely sloppy game for their offense, as [[Tom Brady]] recorded his first interception of the year at the Buffalo 2-yard line and a completion rate under 50%, having gone 18 of 39. New England's offense went a mere 5/18 on third down conversions and only obtained 11 first-downs. The defense, however, recorded four interceptions (three on [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and one on [[Matt Barkley]]) as well as five sacks but also allowed 109 yards of rushing from [[Frank Gore]] and 23 first-downs.

Initially, both teams traded punts, but on the succeeding possession, Patriots' defenders missed numerous tackles and Washington scored on a 65-yard run by [[Steven Sims]]. This was the first time the Patriots had trailed all season. However, New England responded quickly with a no-huddle offense and marched 75 yards, scoring on a 6-yard catch by [[Julian Edelman]]. On the extra-point, newly signed [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Nugent]] missed the kick, his first as a Patriot. Washington's next drive was halted by a sack from [[Danny Shelton]]. Neither team could reach midfield on any of the remaining possessions of the first quarter. With the Patriots' first drive in the second, they raced down the field to the Washington 19, but were stalled and forced to settle for a 37-yard field goal. Both teams went three-and-out on their next drives. Although, on the possession thereafter, [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] forced a fumble on [[Trey Quinn]] and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] recovered. New England's offense failed to score despite being in the redzone, as [[Tom Brady]] threw an awful interception to [[Montae Nicholson]]. Even with this turnover, the Redskins offense lacked momentum and failed to advance. On the next Washington possession, [[Colt McCoy]] was picked by [[Jason McCourty]]. At the Washington 11-yard line, the Patriots went three-and-out and settled for a field goal with the score being 12\u20137 at the end of the first half. With the passing game being mostly unreliable, New England's offense began relying on and utilizing its running game far more. This proved vital as the Patriots advanced rapidly behind [[Sony Michel]]'s rushing attack and they scored on a 29-yard pass to [[Brandon Bolden]]. On the ensuing New England drive, they would score on a 14-yard run by Michel. Both teams exchanged punts for the rest of the game and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 10-yard pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] in a 10-play, 58-yard possession.

Starting with the ball, New England had a slow start on offense. [[Sony Michel]] rushed for 10-yards on the first play, but the drive would soon stall. Cleveland went three-and-out on their first possession; and on the ensuing Patriots possession, they reached the Browns' 2 but were forced to settle for a field goal. They would score again after [[Kyle Van Noy]] returned 26-yard fumble \u2013 in which [[Nick Chubb]] lost the ball after his own lineman's foot knocked it loose -for a touchdown. Notably during the kickoff, [[rookie]] [[Punter (football)|punter]] [[Jake Bailey]] completed his first kick as the replacement for the recently injured [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. Surprisingly, Chubb, on the Browns' next drive, would fumble again after rushing past New England defenders to the Patriots 16 and [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] striking the ball out. The Patriots would soon punt after gaining possession. On Cleveland's first play, [[Baker Mayfield]] threw a shovel pass pick to [[Lawrence Guy]] who returned it to the Browns' 11. [[Tom Brady]] would hit [[Julian Edelman]] on an 8-yard touchdown, two plays later. Finally ending their streak of turnovers, the Browns reached midfield and punted. New England would go three-and-out on the next possession, and the Browns responded with a 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Demetrius Harris]] in an 8 play, 54 yard drive. Seeking to counter, New England attempted a field goal at the Browns 11, but it was blocked by [[Denzel Ward]]. Entering the second half, the Patriots were leading 17\u20137. On the first possession, Cleveland marched to the New England 11, however, a [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] sack halted their advance. The Patriots answered with a touchdown. During the drive, [[James White (running back)|James White]] recorded a 59-yard catch-and-run on a screen and Brady connected with Edelman for their second touchdown of the day. Both teams traded punts for the rest of the third quarter. New England would manage to reach the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] once again, but yet another possession was hampered, and they obtained a field goal. After a series of sacks and penalties on Cleveland, their drive lost momentum immediately and they failed to convert on 4th and 16 at their own 19. The Patriots sought to capitalize off the stop, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed his field goal wide left in what was his last game as a Patriots; he was cut from the team just days later. The Browns would score a field goal on the following possession and neither team would gain anything in particular thereafter.

On 3rd down the patriots supposedly held the Ravens to a field goal but a neutral zone infraction by Shilque Calhoun have the Ravens a first down which led to a 3-yard rushing touchdown by quarterback Lamar Jackson. On the Patriots first possession Tom Brady threw 3 straight incomplete passes which led to a punt. The next drive the Patriots defense showed improvement holding the Ravens to a field goal. The Patriots however did not improve offensively as they had to punt after a 9-yard sack by Patrick Onwuasor. After the first quarter the Ravens led 10\u20130\n\nThe next drive was capitalized by a 53-yard rush by Mark Ingram which was finished with a 12-yard rushing touchdown by Gus Edwards which pushed the Ravens lead 17\u20130. The Patriots once again failed to score after another 3 and out but they caught a break after former Patriot Cyrus Jones muffed a punt by Jake Bailey recovered by newly acquired special teamer Justin Bethel at the Baltimore 20 yard line. This led to a touchdown by newly acquired receiver Mohammed Sanu to become the 74th player to catch a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. After a 3 and out by the Ravens. The Patriots did well on the offensive side of the ball but holding by Marshall Newhouse and intentional grounding prevented the Patriots from scoring leading to a punt.

The Patriots reached the Baltimore 4 yard line but failed to convert on 3rd which led to a field goal making the game 10\u201317. The Ravens punted as the Patriots reached the Baltimore 1 yard line as a touchdown by James White was reversed. A somewhat controversial decision by Belichick was made as they had a chance to tie the game on 4th and Goal at the 1 but decided to take a field goal instead to make it 13\u201317 as the half ended shortly after.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd quarter the Patriots advanced to the Baltimore 30 led by receptions of 11 and 15 yards by Mohammed Sanu. A fumble by Julian Edelman which was returned 70 yards by Marlon Humphrey for a touchdown to advance the Ravens lead to 24\u201313 which was seen as a momentum killer by fans after the game. The next drive the Patriots scored after a 4-yard rushing touchdown on 3rd and 3 by James White to keep it a 1 score game. The next drive the Ravens scored with an 8:09 drive and 14 plays with 16 and 18 yard receptions by Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews. The Ravens scored with a 5-yard pass to Nick Boyle to make the lead 30\u201320 with a missed PAT by Justin Tucker.\n\nIn the 4th quarter down two scores the Patriots threw an interception to Earl Thomas which ultimately killed any chance of winning for the Patriots as Lamar Jackson ran for a 1-yard touchdown after a 14 play drive to put the icing on the cake for a 37\u201320 lead. The game was viewed as an impressive win by the Ravens as Lamar Jackson became a front runner for MVP after a defeat of one of the best teams in the NFL.\n\nThis was the Patriots' first loss since December 16, 2018; it was also their first loss to Baltimore since the 2012 AFC Championship Game.\n\n====Week 11: at Philadelphia Eagles====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Eleven: New England Patriots at Philadelphia Eagles&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=November 17\n|time=4:25&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|road='''Patriots'''\n|R1=0|R2=9|R3=8|R4=0\n|home=Eagles\n|H1=3|H2=7|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=[[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|attendance=69,796\n|weather=Cloudy, {{convert|42|F|C}}\n|referee=Bill Vinovich\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz, Tony Romo and Tracy Wolfson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019111710/2019/REG11/patriots@eagles Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58059/PHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*PHI \u2013 [[Jake Elliott]] 42-yard field goal, 13:38.

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]\u2014and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J.|title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History|publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820|isbn=978-1-84631-635-7|pages=192}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament which, having refused every call for reform, \"they had in any case little cause to lament.\"<ref>Connolly (2012), p. 292</ref> The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament\u2014and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Voice for Ireland: The Famine in the Land.

Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction\u2014toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North\u2014textiles, engineering, shipbuilding\u2014for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites.

People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''.

Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been\u2014as Carson later accounted it\u2014a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \"typical Irishman\"\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland.

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4, 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . .

Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy.

Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]],<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London\u2014understood as a reward for the province's wartime service\u2014to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref>\n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres).

From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]].

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]].\n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics. He had been one of the founders of [[Ulster Protestant Action]] (UPA).

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed.\n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}}</ref>\n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Already in the mid-1980s [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] President [[Gerry Adams]] was pointing to the involvement of the [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolf Tone Clubs]] in [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]], and arguing that human rights had always been an integral part of the republican struggle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Irish Freedom |last=Adams |first=Gerry |year=1986 |publisher=Brandon Books|isbn=0863220843 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nGiven that it appears to extenuate the republican resort to terrorism, Unionists have tended to reject the civil-rights account of the Troubles in almost every particular. in the late 1960s [[Ian Paisley|Paisley]] was not alone is dismissing talk of civil rights as much \"cant\" behind which stood preparations for a renewed armed campaign. There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and\u2014Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and those they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"\u2014that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref>\n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref>\n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\", but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late.<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref>\n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, Faulkner was forced to resign as UUP leader. A [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February was a triumph for the [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]], in which the bulk of his old party stood as \"Official Unionists\" with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections.\n\nWhen in May the Assembly affirmed the Sunningdale Agreement, a loyalist coalition, the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), called a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days: The Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Tensions were further heightened by the UVF [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]].

Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained, however, only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to limit Dublin's influence, the suggestion was that they would have to climb down from their insistence of \"simple majority rule\" and think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aughey|first=Arthur|year=1989|title= Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement|location=Belfast|publisher= Blacksaff Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulster Says No poster.svg|100px|left|Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement]]\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=2 June 2019}} [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).

However, a significant number of Protestants have adhered to the nationalist cause, and likewise with Catholics and unionism. These phenomena continue to exist in Northern Ireland.\n\nBoth unionism and nationalism have had sectarian and anti-sectarian elements. While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy'' Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.

Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]\u2014and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J.|title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History|publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820|isbn=978-1-84631-635-7|pages=192}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Voice for Ireland: The Famine in the Land.

Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction\u2014toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North\u2014textiles, engineering, shipbuilding\u2014for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>\u2014to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903.

Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been\u2014as Carson later accounted it\u2014a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \"typical Irishman\"\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4, 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]],<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen. A 1922 Special Powers Act gave the Northern Ireland Home Affairs Minister discretionary powers to direct the RUC and Specials as his agents in searches, arrests, detentions, and proscriptions.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London\u2014understood as a reward for the province's wartime service\u2014to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref>\n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref>\n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126\u2013129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy.

Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism.\n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]].\n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission.

There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and\u2014Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and those they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly.

Increasingly, the trend has been to ignore the question of religion, particularly as the numbers of practising churchgoers on both sides have been in decline.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"width:450px; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|+\n'''2006 Public Support for Unionism in Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey Homepage |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044131/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/ |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Indicator\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Survey Date\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Overall %\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Protestant %\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Catholic %\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|No religion %\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Support for the union as long-term policy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/NIRELAND.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey \u2013 2006: NIRELAND |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223160056/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/NIRELAND.html |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2006\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|54\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|85\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|46\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Unionist personal identity<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey \u2013 2006: UNINATID |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911130030/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2006\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|British personal identity<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Community_Relations/NINATID.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey \u2013 2006: NINATID |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901031607/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Community_Relations/NINATID.html |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2006\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|63\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Support for unionist political party<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/NIPARTY.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey \u2013 2006: NIPARTY |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827120958/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2006/Political_Attitudes/NIPARTY.html |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2006\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|63\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|}\n\nFor some years, there has been a perception both in Britain and in Ireland that the Catholic birthrate will guarantee a Catholic \u2013 and hence supposedly Nationalist \u2013 majority in Northern Ireland at some point in the first half of the 21st century. However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy'' Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.
