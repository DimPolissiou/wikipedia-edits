{"title_page": "Solas (Dragon Age)", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Solas (''Dragon Age'')}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name            = Solas\n| series          = [[Dragon Age]]\n| image           = \n[[File:Gettyimages-914246230.jpg|thumb]]\n| caption         = Solas as he appears in ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''.\n| first = ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' (2014)\n| voice      = [[Gareth David-Lloyd]]\n | lbl21 = Class\n|data21  = Mage\n| lbl22 = Specialization\n|data22  = Rift Mage\n| race = Elf\n}}\n\n'''Solas''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Dragon Age]]'' franchise. The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. \n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/> \n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/>, and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything.

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. \n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/> \n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/>, and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/> \n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\".

Located in the densely built-up [[Kowloon City District]] with a single runway extending into [[Kowloon Bay]], Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports \u2013 it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and one out of every three flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway.<ref>{{cite book|last=Genzberger|first=Christine|title= Hong Kong Business: The Portable Encyclopedia for Doing Business with Hong Kong|publisher= World Trade Press|year=1994|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jzTkeovg_-MC&pg=PA239| isbn=978-0-9631864-7-8}}</ref> In addition, [[noise mitigation]] measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe [[noise pollution]] (exceeding 105&nbsp;[[dB(A)]] in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated total of at least 340,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/boards/advisory_council/maincontent.html Hong Kong Advisory Council on the Environment]|title=Proposal to Optimise Kai Tak Capacity|date=July 1995|url=http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/textonly/english/boards/advisory_council/files/ace_paper9531.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611111741/http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/textonly/english/boards/advisory_council/files/ace_paper9531.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Paul |title=Airport Planning and Development Handbook: A Global Survey|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1999|page=106|url = https://books.google.com/?id=DLi4-CEGl4YC&pg=PA106|isbn=978-0-07-134316-9}}</ref>\n\nA 1974 planning study by the [[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|Civil Aviation]] and [[Development Bureau|Public Works]] departments identified the small island of Chek Lap Kok, off [[Lantau Island]], as a possible airport replacement site. Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over the [[South China Sea]] rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport master plan and civil engineering studies were completed towards the end of 1982 and 1983 respectively. In February 1983, however, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. In 1988, the Port & Airport Development Strategy (PADS) Study was undertaken by consultants, headed by [[Mott MacDonald|Mott MacDonald Hong Kong Limited]], reporting in December 1989. This study looked at forecasts for both airport and port traffic to the year 2011 and came up with three recommended strategies for overall strategic development in Hong Kong. One of the three assumed maintaining the existing airport at Kai Tak; a second assumed a possible airport in the Western Harbour between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, and the third assumed a new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The consultants produced detailed analyses for each scenario, enabling Government to consider these appraisals for each of the three \"Recommended Strategies\". In October 1989 the Governor of Hong Kong announced to the Legislative Council that a decision had been made on the long-term port and airport development strategy for the territory. The strategy to be adopted was that which included a replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok and incorporating new container terminals 8 and 9 at [[Stonecutters Island]] and east of the island of Tsing Yi respectively.<ref>Port & Airport Development Strategy Study, Final Report, December 1989 by Study Consultants Mott MacDonald Hong Kong et al. for Lands and Works Branch of Hong Kong Government Secretariat</ref>\n\nIn the PADS study, the consultants advised that the earliest the airport could be opened was January 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/HKG/B31927075.pdf|title=PADS Government Secretariat Lands & Works Branch Port & Airport Development Strategy Final Report|date=Dec 1989|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523015234/http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/HKG/B31927075.pdf|archive-date=23 May 2019|url-status=|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref> However, in reaching the government's decision, this date was modified to January 1997, six months prior to the handover of the territory to China.

In the event, British Prime Minister [[John Major]] opened the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], the main access to [[Lantau Island]] and the airport and its supporting community in May 1997, prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China. The airport itself was opened in July 1998.\n\nThe construction period was very rushed; specialists considered that only a 10\u201320-year period was sufficient for this massive project. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Another cause for this rush was due to the uncertain future of the airport construction after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. Shortly after the then-British colonial government of Hong Kong announced plans to construct the new airport, the Chinese government in Beijing began voicing objections to various aspects of the massive project, which prompted financial institutions to delay extending project finance. Without access to this financing, many of the companies who had secured contracts to build various portions of the project halted construction, resulting in delays that pushed the actual opening of the airport, originally planned to take place before the transition in sovereignty until one year after. As agreements were reached with the government in China, Beijing removed most of its objections and work then continued, albeit behind schedule.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHong Kong International Airport was built on a large [[artificial island]] formed by flattening and levelling [[Chek Lap Kok]] and [[Lam Chau]] islands ({{convert|3.02|km2|sqmi}} and {{convert|0.08|km2|sqmi}} respectively) and [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaiming]] {{convert|9.38|km2|sqmi}} of the adjacent seabed.

The project is the most expensive airport project ever, according to [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]].

Mott Connell were the designers for foundations, all other structural components and the mechanical and electrical work.

The [[flight information display system]] (FIDS) had suddenly shut down which caused long delays. Shortly afterwards, the cargo-communication link with Kai Tak, where all the necessary data was stored (some still stored there then), went down. During the same period of time, someone had accidentally deleted an important database for cargo services. This meant that cargo had to be manually stored. At one point, the airport had to turn away all air cargo and freight headed for and exported from Hong Kong (except food and medical supplies) while it sorted out the huge mess. HKIA simply could not keep up without an automated assistant-computer system.<ref name=buildhkg/> For three to five months after its opening, it suffered various severe organisational, mechanical and technical problems that almost crippled the airport and its operations. Computer glitches were mostly to blame for the major crisis.

The main focus is to improve the overall capacity and aircraft handling ability of the airport. Based on this, two options have been developed.\n\n====Option 1: Two-runway system====\nTo maintain the current two-runway system, there will be enhancements to the terminal and apron facilities to increase the airport's capacity. This option will enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of this plan is $23.4 billion [[Hong Kong dollar]]s in 2010 prices, or HK$42.5 billion in money-of-the-day{{when|date=July 2014}} prices. However, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] estimates that the airport will reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway is added.\n\n====Option 2: Three-runway system====\n\nThis plan will focus on adding a third runway to the north of the [[Chek Lap Kok]], the existing island the airport is built on, by land reclamation, using [[deep cement mixing]], of about {{convert|650|ha|acres}}. Associated facilities, additional terminals, airfield and apron facilities, will be built as well, and, combined with the new runway, it is estimated that the airport would be able to handle a maximum of 620,000 flights per year (102 per hour, or about one flight every 36 seconds), and meet forecast annual passenger and cargo throughput of about 97 million and 8.9 million tonnes by 2030 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/576311/new-skypier-will-improve-delta-connections|title=New Skypier will improve delta connections|date=20 Apr 2018|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nThere are possible drawbacks. Development costs are a concern: although the proposal would increase the number of direct jobs associated with HKIA to 150,000 by 2030 and generate an ENPV of HK$912 billion (in 2009 dollars), the estimated cost is approximately $86.2 billion (2010) Hong Kong Dollars, or HK$141.5 billion (at money-of-the-day prices).<ref>{{cite web|title=LCQ7: Financial arrangement of the three-runway system project at Hong Kong International Airport|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201504/22/P201504210517.htm|publisher=Legislative Council|accessdate=22 April 2015|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> There are also environmental and local noise pollution concerns.\n\nOn 20 March 2012, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Government]] adopted this option as the official expansion plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkairport2030.com/en/information/press/20120320.html |script-title=zh:\u4e09\u8dd1\u9053\u7cfb\u7d71 - \u9999\u6e2f\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834|accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=zh-hant}}</ref>\n\nThe third runway, with its own dedicated passenger concourse, is currently being built parallel to the current two runways on reclaimed land directly north of the existing airport island.

the Airport Control Tower.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the airport control tower]]\n\n==Operations==\nThe airport is operated by the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong]], a statutory body wholly owned by the Government of Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].<ref name=Introduction>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/airport-authority/introduction.html|work=Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways, both of which are {{convert|3800|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide. The south runway has a [[Instrument Landing System|Category II Precision Approach]], while the north runway has the higher Category IIIA rating, which allows pilots to land in only {{convert|200|m|ft|adj = on}} visibility. The two runways have a capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The Airport is upgrading ATC and runways so that they can handle 68 movements per hour. Normally, the north runway (07L/25R) is used for landing passenger planes. The south runway (07R/25L) is used for passenger planes taking off and cargo flights due to its proximity to the cargo terminal.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures\"/>\n\nThere are 49 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 28 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. There are also five parking bays at the Northwest Concourse. A satellite concourse with 10 frontal stands for narrow body aircraft has been commissioned to the north of the main concourse at the end of 2009, bringing the total number of frontal stands at the airport to 59.\n\nThe airport was the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest for passenger traffic]] in Asia in 2010, and the [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|world's busiest airport for cargo traffic]] in 2010. In terms of international traffic, the airport is the third busiest for passenger traffic and the busiest for cargo since its operation in 1998. There are over 95 international airlines providing about 900 scheduled passenger and all-cargo flights each day between Hong Kong and some 160 destinations worldwide. About 76 percent of these flights are operated with wide-body jets. There is also an average of approximately 31 non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights each week.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html|title=Our Business \u2013 The Airport \u2013 Welcome to HKIA \u2013 Hong Kong International Airport|author=Airport Authority Hong Kong}}</ref>\n\nThe operation of scheduled air services to and from [[Hong Kong]] is facilitated by air services agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Since the opening of HKIA, the [[Hong Kong Government|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government]] has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services. Many [[low-cost airlines]] have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.<ref name=\"Vision and Missions\">{{cite web|title=Vision and Missions|url=https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/airport-authority/vision-mission.html|work=Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. An [[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]] 80 billion proposal to build a third runway has been under feasibility study and consultation but would be very expensive as it would involve additional reclamation from deep waters, and the building cost of the third runway may be as high as the building cost of the entire airport. On the other hand, there exists only one airway between Hong Kong and mainland China, and this single route is often and easily backed up causing delays on both sides. In addition, China requires that aircraft flying the single air route between Hong Kong and the mainland must be at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. Talks are underway to persuade the Chinese military to relax its airspace restriction in view of worsening air traffic congestion at the airport. Other than that, [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Hong Kong Airport Authority]] is co-operating with other airports in the area to relieve air traffic and in the future, [[Shenzhen]] may act as a regional airport while Hong Kong receives all the international flights.<ref name=\"Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030\">{{cite web|title=Publications|url= http://www.hkairport2030.com/en/information/publications.html|work=Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Air traffic==\n\nThe [[Government Flying Service (Hong Kong)|Government Flying Service]] provides short and long range search and rescue services, police support, medical evacuation and general purpose flights for the Government.\n\n===Passenger facilities===\n\nDespite its size, the passenger terminal was designed for convenience. The layout and signage, moving walkways and the automated people mover help passengers move through the building. The [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover|HKIA Automated People Mover]], a driverless [[people mover]] system with 3 stations transports passengers between the check-in area and the gates. The trains travel at {{convert|62|km/h|mph}}. The airport also boasts an [[IMAX]] theatre that has the largest screen in Hong Kong.  The theatre is located in Terminal 2, level 6 and can seat 350 persons at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flight-hub-reviews.com/hong-kong-international-flight-hub/|title=Hong Kong International Aviation Hub|author=travelsites33|date=19 April 2015|work=Flight Hub Reviews|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre====\n\n[[File:HKIA Business Aviation Centre.jpg|thumb|300px|Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre]]\nThe Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre (BAC) is located within the airport and has its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminal. It provides services for executive aircraft and passengers, including a passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, business centre facilities, ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Designated spaces and hangars are also provided at the BAC for private aircraft.\n\n===Intermodal transportation hub===\n\nTo sustain the growth of passengers, the Airport Authority formulated a \"push and pull through\" strategy to expand its connections to new sources of passengers and cargo. This means adapting the network to the rapidly growing markets in China and in particular to the [[Pearl River Delta]] region (PRD). In 2003, a new Airport-Mainland Coach Station opened. The coach station has a {{convert|230|m2|sqft|adj = on}} waiting lounge and sheltered bays for ten coaches. Many buses operate each day to transport passengers between HKIA and major cities in the Mainland.<ref>[https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/cbt/cross.html Transport to Guangdong] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318141546/http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/cbt/cross.html |date=18 March 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Coach Station was relocated to the ground floor (level 3) of Terminal 2 in 2007. The 36 bays at the new Coach Station allow cross-border coaches to make 320 trips a day carrying passengers between the airport and 90 cities and towns in the PRD. Local tour and hotel coaches also operate from T2. The coach station at T2 has shops and waiting lounges as well as a mainland coach service centre which gathers all operators together.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html|title=Our Business \u2013 The Airport \u2013 Welcome to HKIA \u2013 Hong Kong International Airport |publisher=Hongkongairport.com|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late September 2003, the SkyPier high-speed ferry terminal opened. Passengers arriving at the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their ride back to the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports \u2013 [[Shekou Industrial Zone|Shekou]], [[Shenzhen]], Macau and [[Humen Town|Humen]] ([[Dongguan]]) \u2013 were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves [[Shenzhen|Shenzhen's]] [[Shekou]] and [[Fuyong]], [[Dongguan|Dongguan's]] [[Humen]], [[Macau]], [[Zhongshan]] and [[Zhuhai]]. Passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau can complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and go straight to the boarding gate for the flight at HKIA.\n\nIn 2009, the permanent SkyPier Terminal opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/576311/new-skypier-will-improve-delta-connections|title=New Skypier will improve delta connections|date=23 Dec 2006|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The permanent ferry terminal is equipped with four berths, but the terminal is designed to accommodate eight berths. Transfer desks and baggage handling facilities are included, and the terminal is directly connected to the airport automatic people mover system.\n\n[[File:HK Airport Terminal 1.jpg|thumb|800px|center|Terminal 1]]\n[[File:VHHH baggage claim area.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Baggage Reclaim Hall]]\n\n===Baggage and cargo facilities===\n\n[[File:Super Terminal01.jpg|thumb|SuperTerminal 1]]\n[[File:Asia Airfreight Terminal.jpg|thumb|Asia Airfreight Terminal]]\n[[File:DHL HKIA.jpg|thumb|DHL Central Asia Hub]]\nRamp handling services are provided by [[Hong Kong Airport Services Limited]] (HAS), [[Jardine Air Terminal Services Limited]] and [[SATS Ltd|SATS]] HK Limited. Their services include the handling of mail and passenger baggage, transportation of cargo, aerobridge operations and the operation of passenger stairways. The airport has an advanced [[baggage handling system]] (BHS), the main section of which is located in the basement level of the passenger terminal, and a separate remote transfer facility at the western end of the main concourse for the handling of tight connection transfer bags.\n\nHKIA handles over five million tonnes of cargo annually.<ref>[https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/afacilities/index.html Air Cargo \u2013 HKIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318195727/http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/afacilities/index.html |date=18 March 2006 }}</ref> [[Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited]] operates one of the two air cargo terminals at the airport.

Line maintenance services include routine servicing of aircraft performed during normal turnaround periods and regularly scheduled layover periods. Base maintenance covers all airframe maintenance services and for this [[HAECO]] has a three-bay hangar, which can accommodate up to three [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft and two [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] aircraft, and an adjoining support workshop. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} HAECO also has the world's largest mobile hangar, weighing over 400 tons. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} It can be used to enclose half of a [[wide-body]] aeroplane so that the whole facility can fully enclose four 747s when the mobile hangar is used.\n\nOn 29 May 2009, CASL opened its first aircraft maintenance hangar in the maintenance area of the airport. The new hangar occupies an area of about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft}} and can accommodate one wide-body and one [[narrow-body]] aircraft at the same time; the hangar also has an about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft|adj = on}} area in its annexe building. CASL specialises in [[Airbus A320 family]] and [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] series heavy maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casl.com.hk/|title=CASL|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Airport based ground services===\nThe Air Traffic Control Complex (ATCX), located at the centre of the airfield, is the nerve centre of the entire air traffic control system. Some 370 air traffic controllers and supporting staff work around the clock to provide air traffic control services for the [[Hong Kong Flight Information Region]] (FIR). At the [[Air traffic control|Air Traffic Control]] Tower, controllers provide 24-hour aerodrome control services to aircraft operating at the airport. A backup Air Traffic Control Centre/Tower constructed to the north of the ATCX is available for operational use in the event normal services provided in the ATCX are disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. Apart from serving as an operational backup, the facilities are also used for air traffic control training.\n\nThe Airport Meteorological Office (AMO) of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]] (HKO) provides weather services for the aviation community. The AMO issues alerts of low-level [[windshear]] and turbulence. Windshear detection is made using traditional [[doppler weather radar]]s as well as the more effective [[doppler LIDAR]], of which Hong Kong International Airport was the first to introduce. Doppler LIDAR systems use lasers to detect windshear and wind direction even when atmospheric conditions are too dry for Doppler radar to work.\n\n===Fire and rescue services===\nRescue and fire fighting services within the airport are covered by the Airport Fire Contingent of the [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]]. The contingent has 282 members, operating two fire stations and two rescue berths for 24-hour emergency calls. It is equipped with 14 fire appliances which can respond to incidents within two minutes in optimum conditions of visibility and surface conditions, satisfying the relevant recommendation of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].

Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over the [[South China Sea]] rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport master plan and civil engineering studies were completed towards the end of 1982 and 1983 respectively. In February 1983, however, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. In 1988, the Port & Airport Development Strategy (PADS) Study was undertaken by consultants, headed by [[Mott MacDonald|Mott MacDonald Hong Kong Limited]], reporting in December 1989. This study looked at forecasts for both airport and port traffic to the year 2011 and came up with three recommended strategies for overall strategic development in Hong Kong. One of the three assumed maintaining the existing airport at Kai Tak; a second assumed a possible airport in the Western Harbour between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, and the third assumed a new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The consultants produced detailed analyses for each scenario, enabling Government to consider these appraisals for each of the three \"Recommended Strategies\". In October 1989 the Governor of Hong Kong announced to the Legislative Council that a decision had been made on the long-term port and airport development strategy for the territory. The strategy to be adopted was that which included a replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok and incorporating new container terminals 8 and 9 at [[Stonecutters Island]] and east of the island of Tsing Yi respectively.<ref>Port & Airport Development Strategy Study, Final Report, December 1989 by Study Consultants Mott MacDonald Hong Kong et al. for Lands and Works Branch of Hong Kong Government Secretariat</ref>\n\nIn the PADS study, the consultants advised that the earliest the airport could be opened was January 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/HKG/B31927075.pdf|title=PADS Government Secretariat Lands & Works Branch Port & Airport Development Strategy Final Report|date=Dec 1989|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523015234/http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/HKG/B31927075.pdf|archive-date=23 May 2019|url-status=|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref> However, in reaching the government's decision, this date was modified to January 1997, six months prior to the handover of the territory to China.

In the event, British Prime Minister [[John Major]] opened the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], the main access to [[Lantau Island]] and the airport and its supporting community in May 1997, prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China. The airport itself was opened in July 1998.\n\nThe construction period was very rushed; specialists considered that only a 10\u201320-year period was sufficient for this massive project. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Another cause for this rush was due to the uncertain future of the airport construction after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. Shortly after the then-British colonial government of Hong Kong announced plans to construct the new airport, the Chinese government in Beijing began voicing objections to various aspects of the massive project, which prompted financial institutions to delay extending project finance. Without access to this financing, many of the companies who had secured contracts to build various portions of the project halted construction, resulting in delays that pushed the actual opening of the airport, originally planned to take place before the transition in sovereignty until one year after. As agreements were reached with the government in China, Beijing removed most of its objections and work then continued, albeit behind schedule.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHong Kong International Airport was built on a large [[artificial island]] formed by flattening and levelling [[Chek Lap Kok]] and [[Lam Chau]] islands ({{convert|3.02|km2|sqmi}} and {{convert|0.08|km2|sqmi}} respectively) and [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaiming]] {{convert|9.38|km2|sqmi}} of the adjacent seabed.

The [[flight information display system]] (FIDS) had suddenly shut down which caused long delays. Shortly afterwards, the cargo-communication link with Kai Tak, where all the necessary data was stored (some still stored there then), went down. During the same period of time, someone had accidentally deleted an important database for cargo services. This meant that cargo had to be manually stored. At one point, the airport had to turn away all air cargo and freight headed for and exported from Hong Kong (except food and medical supplies) while it sorted out the huge mess. HKIA simply could not keep up without an automated assistant-computer system.<ref name=buildhkg/> For three to five months after its opening, it suffered various severe organisational, mechanical and technical problems that almost crippled the airport and its operations.

The main focus is to improve the overall capacity and aircraft handling ability of the airport. Based on this, two options have been developed.\n\n====Option 1: Two-runway system====\nTo maintain the current two-runway system, there will be enhancements to the terminal and apron facilities to increase the airport's capacity. This option will enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of this plan is $23.4 billion [[Hong Kong dollar]]s in 2010 prices, or HK$42.5 billion in money-of-the-day{{when|date=July 2014}} prices. However, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] estimates that the airport will reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway is added.\n\n====Option 2: Three-runway system====\n\nThis plan will focus on adding a third runway to the north of the [[Chek Lap Kok]], the existing island the airport is built on, by land reclamation, using [[deep cement mixing]], of about {{convert|650|ha|acres}}. Associated facilities, additional terminals, airfield and apron facilities, will be built as well, and, combined with the new runway, it is estimated that the airport would be able to handle a maximum of 620,000 flights per year (102 per hour, or about one flight every 36 seconds), and meet forecast annual passenger and cargo throughput of about 97 million and 8.9 million tonnes by 2030 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/576311/new-skypier-will-improve-delta-connections|title=New Skypier will improve delta connections|date=20 Apr 2018|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nThere are possible drawbacks. Development costs are a concern: although the proposal would increase the number of direct jobs associated with HKIA to 150,000 by 2030 and generate an ENPV of HK$912 billion (in 2009 dollars), the estimated cost is approximately $86.2 billion (2010) Hong Kong Dollars, or HK$141.5 billion (at money-of-the-day prices).<ref>{{cite web|title=LCQ7: Financial arrangement of the three-runway system project at Hong Kong International Airport|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201504/22/P201504210517.htm|publisher=Legislative Council|accessdate=22 April 2015|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> There are also environmental and local noise pollution concerns.\n\nOn 20 March 2012, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Government]] adopted this option as the official expansion plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkairport2030.com/en/information/press/20120320.html |script-title=zh:\u4e09\u8dd1\u9053\u7cfb\u7d71 - \u9999\u6e2f\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834|accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=zh-hant}}</ref>\n\nThe third runway, with its own dedicated passenger concourse, is currently being built parallel to the current two runways on reclaimed land directly north of the existing airport island.

the Government of Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].<ref name=Introduction>{{cite

The south runway has a [[Instrument Landing System|Category II Precision Approach]], while the north runway has the higher Category IIIA rating, which allows pilots to land in only {{convert|200|m|ft|adj = on}} visibility. The two runways have a capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The Airport is upgrading ATC and runways so that they can handle 68 movements per hour. Normally, the north runway (07L/25R) is used for landing passenger planes. The south runway (07R/25L) is used for passenger planes taking off and cargo flights due to its proximity to the cargo terminal.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures\"/>\n\nThere are 49 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 28 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. There are also five parking bays at the Northwest Concourse. A satellite concourse with 10 frontal stands for narrow body aircraft has been commissioned to the north of the main concourse at the end of 2009, bringing the total number of frontal stands at the airport to 59.\n\nThe airport was the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest for passenger traffic]] in Asia in 2010, and the [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|world's busiest airport for cargo traffic]] in 2010. In terms of international traffic, the airport is the third busiest for passenger traffic and the busiest for cargo since its operation in 1998. There are over 95 international airlines providing about 900 scheduled passenger and all-cargo flights each day between Hong Kong and some 160 destinations worldwide. About 76 percent of these flights are operated with wide-body jets. There is also an average of approximately 31 non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights each week.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html|title=Our Business \u2013 The Airport \u2013 Welcome to HKIA \u2013 Hong Kong International Airport|author=Airport Authority Hong Kong}}</ref>\n\nThe operation of scheduled air services to and from [[Hong Kong]] is facilitated by air services agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Since the opening of HKIA, the [[Hong Kong Government|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government]] has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services. Many [[low-cost airlines]] have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.<ref name=\"Vision and Missions\">{{cite web|title=Vision and Missions|url=https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/airport-authority/vision-mission.html|work=Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. An [[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]] 80 billion proposal to build a third runway has been under feasibility study and consultation but would be very expensive as it would involve additional reclamation from deep waters, and the building cost of the third runway may be as high as the building cost of the entire airport. On the other hand, there exists only one airway between Hong Kong and mainland China, and this single route is often and easily backed up causing delays on both sides. In addition, China requires that aircraft flying the single air route between Hong Kong and the mainland must be at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. Talks are underway to persuade the Chinese military to relax its airspace restriction in view of worsening air traffic congestion at the airport. Other than that, [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Hong Kong Airport Authority]] is co-operating with other airports in the area to relieve air traffic and in the future, [[Shenzhen]] may act as a regional airport while Hong Kong receives all the international flights.<ref name=\"Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030\">{{cite web|title=Publications|url= http://www.hkairport2030.com/en/information/publications.html|work=Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Air traffic==\n\nThe [[Government Flying Service (Hong Kong)|Government Flying Service]] provides short and long range search and rescue services, police support, medical evacuation and general purpose flights for the Government.\n\n===Passenger facilities===\n\nDespite its size, the passenger terminal was designed for convenience. The layout and signage, moving walkways and the automated people mover help passengers move through the building. The [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover|HKIA Automated People Mover]], a driverless [[people mover]] system with 3 stations transports passengers between the check-in area and the gates. The trains travel at {{convert|62|km/h|mph}}. The airport also boasts an [[IMAX]] theatre that has the largest screen in Hong Kong.  The theatre is located in Terminal 2, level 6 and can seat 350 persons at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flight-hub-reviews.com/hong-kong-international-flight-hub/|title=Hong Kong International Aviation Hub|author=travelsites33|date=19 April 2015|work=Flight Hub Reviews|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre====\n\n[[File:HKIA Business Aviation Centre.jpg|thumb|300px|Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre]]\nThe Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre (BAC) is located within the airport and has its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminal. It provides services for executive aircraft and passengers, including a passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, business centre facilities, ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Designated spaces and hangars are also provided at the BAC for private aircraft.\n\n===Intermodal transportation hub===\n\nTo sustain the growth of passengers, the Airport Authority formulated a \"push and pull through\" strategy to expand its connections to new sources of passengers and cargo. This means adapting the network to the rapidly growing markets in China and in particular to the [[Pearl River Delta]] region (PRD). In 2003, a new Airport-Mainland Coach Station opened. The coach station has a {{convert|230|m2|sqft|adj = on}} waiting lounge and sheltered bays for ten coaches. Many buses operate each day to transport passengers between HKIA and major cities in the Mainland.<ref>[https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/cbt/cross.html Transport to Guangdong] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318141546/http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/cbt/cross.html |date=18 March 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Coach Station was relocated to the ground floor (level 3) of Terminal 2 in 2007. The 36 bays at the new Coach Station allow cross-border coaches to make 320 trips a day carrying passengers between the airport and 90 cities and towns in the PRD. Local tour and hotel coaches also operate from T2. The coach station at T2 has shops and waiting lounges as well as a mainland coach service centre which gathers all operators together.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html|title=Our Business \u2013 The Airport \u2013 Welcome to HKIA \u2013 Hong Kong International Airport |publisher=Hongkongairport.com|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late September 2003, the SkyPier high-speed ferry terminal opened. Passengers arriving at the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their ride back to the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports \u2013 [[Shekou Industrial Zone|Shekou]], [[Shenzhen]], Macau and [[Humen Town|Humen]] ([[Dongguan]]) \u2013 were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves [[Shenzhen|Shenzhen's]] [[Shekou]] and [[Fuyong]], [[Dongguan|Dongguan's]] [[Humen]], [[Macau]], [[Zhongshan]] and [[Zhuhai]]. Passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau can complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and go straight to the boarding gate for the flight at HKIA.\n\nIn 2009, the permanent SkyPier Terminal opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/576311/new-skypier-will-improve-delta-connections|title=New Skypier will improve delta connections|date=23 Dec 2006|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The permanent ferry terminal is equipped with four berths, but the terminal is designed to accommodate eight berths.

Line maintenance services include routine servicing of aircraft performed during normal turnaround periods and regularly scheduled layover periods. Base maintenance covers all airframe maintenance services and for this [[HAECO]] has a three-bay hangar, which can accommodate up to three [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft and two [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] aircraft, and an adjoining support workshop. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} HAECO also has the world's largest mobile hangar, weighing over 400 tons. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} It can be used to enclose half of a [[wide-body]] aeroplane so that the whole facility can fully enclose four 747s when the mobile hangar is used.\n\nOn 29 May 2009, CASL opened its first aircraft maintenance hangar in the maintenance area of the airport. The new hangar occupies an area of about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft}} and can accommodate one wide-body and one [[narrow-body]] aircraft at the same time; the hangar also has an about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft|adj = on}} area in its annexe building. CASL specialises in [[Airbus A320 family]] and [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] series heavy maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casl.com.hk/|title=CASL|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Airport based ground services===\nThe Air Traffic Control Complex (ATCX), located at the centre of the airfield, is the nerve centre of the entire air traffic control system. Some 370 air traffic controllers and supporting staff work around the clock to provide air traffic control services for the [[Hong Kong Flight Information Region]] (FIR). At the [[Air traffic control|Air Traffic Control]] Tower, controllers provide 24-hour aerodrome control services to aircraft operating at the airport. A backup Air Traffic Control Centre/Tower constructed to the north of the ATCX is available for operational use in the event normal services provided in the ATCX are disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. Apart from serving as an operational backup, the facilities are also used for air traffic control training.\n\nThe Airport Meteorological Office (AMO) of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]] (HKO) provides weather services for the aviation community. The AMO issues alerts of low-level [[windshear]] and turbulence. Windshear detection is made using traditional [[doppler weather radar]]s as well as the more effective [[doppler LIDAR]], of which Hong Kong International Airport was the first to introduce. Doppler LIDAR systems use lasers to detect windshear and wind direction even when atmospheric conditions are too dry for Doppler radar to work.\n\n===Fire and rescue services===\nRescue and fire fighting services within the airport are covered by the Airport Fire Contingent of the [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]]. The contingent has 282 members, operating two fire stations and two rescue berths for 24-hour emergency calls. It is equipped with 14 fire appliances which can respond to incidents within two minutes in optimum conditions of visibility and surface conditions, satisfying the relevant recommendation of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]. Two high capacity rescue boats, supported by eight speed boats, form the core of sea rescue operations. Two ambulances are also assigned at each of the airport fire stations.\n\n==Ground transport==\n\nThe airport is connected to inner Hong Kong by the [[North Lantau Highway]] on [[Lantau Island]].\n\nThere is an [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover|automated people mover]], operated by the Airport Authority and maintained by [[MTR Corporation]], connecting the East Hall to the Midfield Concourse via West Hall and Terminal 2. It was extended to SkyPier in late 2009 and extended to Midfield Concourse in 2015.\n\n===Bus===\n\n[[File:HKairport t2 01.JPG|thumb|Cross-boundary coach bus terminal located in terminal 2]]\n{{Main|Buses in Hong Kong}}\n\n[[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], [[New Lantau Bus]], [[Long Win Bus]] and [[Discovery Bay|Discovery Bay Transit Services]] operate 25 bus routes to the airport from various parts of Hong Kong, available at the Airport Ground Transportation Centre and Cheong Tat Road.

Passengers using these services are treated as transit passengers and are not considered to have entered Hong Kong for immigration purposes. For this reason, access to the ferry terminal is before immigration in the airport for arriving passengers. Check-in services are available at these piers. Four ports \u2013 [[Shekou Industrial Zone|Shekou]], [[Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport|Shenzhen Airport (Fuyong)]], [[Macau]] and [[Humen Town|Humen (Dongguan)]] \u2013 were initially served, extending to [[Guangzhou]] and [[Zhongshan]] at the end of 2003.
