The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram A, the warp]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram B, the weft]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram C, the tartan. The combining of the warp and weft.]]\n\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604051800/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] }}</ref>\n\n===Colour: shades and meaning===\n\nThe shades of colour in tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan.

In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n;Ancient colours: refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n;Muted colours: also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used. For example, the colour ''green'' sometimes represents [[prairie]]s or forests, ''blue'' can represent lakes and rivers, and the colour ''yellow'' is sometimes used to represent various [[crop]]s.<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-medieval origins===\n\n[[File:Scottish soldiers in service of Gustavus Adolphus, 1631-cropped-.jpg|thumb|The earliest image of Scottish soldiers wearing tartan, 1631 German engraving.<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--63\"/>{{efn|The Highlanders depicted were sometimes mistakenly described as [[Irish people|Irish]] \"Irrl\u00e4nder oder Irren\".

The present official [[Clan Campbell]] tartans are predominantly blue, green and black.<ref name=\"ccsna-jsep50a\"/>]]\nThe tartan as we know it today is not thought to have existed in Scotland before the 16th century. By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It is not until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind of uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] pp. 66\u201367.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the Highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{efn|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: \"each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence&nbsp;...\"<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 65\u201366. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An incident in the rebellion of 1745''.

Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

The Queen and prince bought [[Balmoral Castle]] in 1848 and hired a local architect to re-model the estate in \"[[Scottish Baronial architecture|Scots Baronial]]\" style. Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the red ''Royal Stewart'' and the green ''Hunting Stewart'' tartans for carpets, while using the ''Dress Stewart'' for curtains and upholstery. The Queen designed the ''Victoria'' tartan, and Prince Albert the ''Balmoral'', still used as a royal tartan today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tartan in Royal Dress |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/fashioning-a-reign/palace-of-holyroodhouse/tartan-in-royal-dress |accessdate=3 February 2020 |agency=Royal Collection Trust}}</ref>\n\nVictoria and Albert spent a considerable amount of time at their estate, and in doing so hosted many \"Highland\" activities.

Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a.

This is the personal tartan of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The sett was first published in 1831 in the book ''The Scottish Gael'' by James Logan. In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, Royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish [[shortbread]].<ref>Marketing\". p. 9.

By then, tartan had shifted from being mainly a component of men's clothing to become an important part of women's fashion. In consequence of its association with the British aristocracy and military, tartan developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan has made reappearances in the world of fashion several times.\n\n[[File:Punkertreffen 1984 - Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|A German [[Punk subculture|punk]] wearing a piece of the [[Royal Stewart tartan]], 1984]]\nFor instance, tartan made a resurgence in its use in [[punk fashion]].

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Scotland|United Kingdom}}\n[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scottish actor [[Sean Connery]] at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in Washington D.C.]]\n* [[Argyle (pattern)]]\n* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], whose athletic mascot is Scotty the Scottie Dog; their athletic teams are known as \"The Tartans\"\n* [[Check (pattern)]]\n* [[Flannel]]\n* [[List of tartans]]\n* [[List of U.S. state tartans]], officially recognised tartans of states in the US (created in the 1980s)\n* [[Madras (cloth)]]\n* [[Regional tartans of Canada]], officially recognised tartans of the provinces and territories of Canada (created in the 1950s)\n* [[Sobieski Stuarts]]\n* [[Tartan Army]], popular name for the fans of the Scotland football team\n* [[Tartan Day]], a day of celebration, in Canada and the US, recognising the influence of Scottish immigration to these countries\n* [[Tartanry]]\n* ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', the Victorian forgery that is the source of many of today's clan tartans\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-6815-X |ref=A1}} (originally published by: W. & A.

The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram A, the warp]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram B, the weft]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram C, the tartan. The combining of the warp and weft.]]\n\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604051800/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] }}</ref>\n\n===Colour: shades and meaning===\n\nThe shades of colour in tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan.

In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n;Ancient colours: refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n;Muted colours: also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used.

The present official [[Clan Campbell]] tartans are predominantly blue, green and black.<ref name=\"ccsna-jsep50a\"/>]]\nThe tartan as we know it today is not thought to have existed in Scotland before the 16th century. By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It is not until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind of uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] pp. 66\u201367.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the Highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{efn|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: \"each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence&nbsp;...\"<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 65\u201366. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An incident in the rebellion of 1745''. The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] p. 84.</ref>]]\nIt is generally regarded that \"clan tartans\" date no earlier than the beginning of the 19th century, and are an example of an [[invented tradition]]. Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

Evidence suggests that in 1725 the Independent Highland Companies may have worn a uniform tartan.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" />\n\n==Modern tartans==\nBy the 19th century the Highland romantic revival, inspired by [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems and the writings of Sir [[Walter Scott]], led to wider interest, with clubs like the Celtic Society of Edinburgh welcoming Lowlanders. The pageantry invented for the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] brought a sudden demand for tartan cloth and made it the [[Folk costume|national dress]] of the whole of Scotland, rather than just the Highlands and Islands, with the invention of many new clan-specific tartans to suit.\n\n===Georgian royal patronage===\n{{Further|Visit of King George IV to Scotland}}\n\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Wilkie]]'s idealised depiction of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in full [[Highland dress]], during the visit to Scotland in 1822{{efn|Sir [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s portrait of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] depicts the king as being much slimmer than he actually was.

Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the red ''Royal Stewart'' and the green ''Hunting Stewart'' tartans for carpets, while using the ''Dress Stewart'' for curtains and upholstery.

Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a.

The concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term of ''universal tartan'', or ''free tartan'', which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone.

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Scotland|United Kingdom}}\n[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scottish actor [[Sean Connery]] at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in Washington D.C.]]\n* [[Argyle (pattern)]]\n* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], whose athletic mascot is Scotty the Scottie Dog; their athletic teams are known as \"The Tartans\"\n* [[Check (pattern)]]\n* [[Flannel]]\n* [[List of tartans]]\n* [[List of U.S. state tartans]], officially recognised tartans of states in the US (created in the 1980s)\n* [[Madras (cloth)]]\n* [[Regional tartans of Canada]], officially recognised tartans of the provinces and territories of Canada (created in the 1950s)\n* [[Sobieski Stuarts]]\n* [[Tartan Army]], popular name for the fans of the Scotland football team\n* [[Tartan Day]], a day of celebration, in Canada and the US, recognising the influence of Scottish immigration to these countries\n* [[Tartanry]]\n* ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', the Victorian forgery that is the source of many of today's clan tartans\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-6815-X |ref=A1}} (originally published by: W. & A.

{"title_page": "Vestiarium Scoticum", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\nThe '''''Vestiarium Scoticum''''' (full title, ''Vestiarium Scoticum: from the Manuscript formerly in the Library of the Scots College at Douay. With an Introduction and Notes, by [[John Sobieski Stuart]]'') was a book which was first published in 1842 by [[William Tait (publisher)|William Tait]] of [[Edinburgh]] in a limited edition. John Telfer Dunbar, in his seminal work ''History of Highland Dress,'' referred to it as \"probably the most controversial costume book ever written\".\n\nThe book itself is purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a 15th-century manuscript on the clan tartans of Scottish families. Shortly after its publication it was denounced as a forgery, and the \"Stuart\" brothers who brought it forth were also denounced as impostors for claiming to be the grandsons of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. It is generally accepted today that neither the brothers themselves nor the ''Vestiarium'' are what they were purported to be.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scottish Tartans Resources: Vestiarium Scoticum - 1842|url=http://scottishtartans.org/resources/vestiarium.php|website=Scottishtartans.org|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the role of the book in the history of Scottish [[tartan]]s is immense, with many of the designs and patterns contained therein passing into the realm of \"official\" [[clan]] tartans.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe 1842 edition of the ''Vestiarium'' had its beginnings in the late 1820s, when the Sobieski Stuart brothers, then residents of [[Moray, Scotland]], produced a copy of a document containing tartan patterns and showed it to their host, Sir [[Thomas Dick Lauder]], [[Baronet|Bt]]. This manuscript, however, was not the one that the brothers claimed to be the basis for the later publication of the ''Vestiarium''.\n\nAs explained in the Preface to the 1842 edition (which is extensively excerpted in Dunbar's ''History of Highland Dress''), the copy which Sir Thomas saw, now known as the Cromarty MS, which bore the date 1721 on the first page and with the title ''Liber Vestiarium Scotia'', was said by its possessors to have been obtained from a certain John Ross of Cromarty, and was said also by them to be an inferior copy of an earlier manuscript.\n\nIn this same Preface, it is claimed that the 1842 edition is based on an original manuscript, now known as the Douay MS, whose date was claimed to be 1571 (or earlier), which was at that time in the possession of [[John Lesley]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]]. This Douay MS is said by the author of the Preface to be the \"oldest and most perfect\" copy of the ''Vestiarium''. Having once been in the possession of Bishop Ross, it had found its way subsequently into the library of the [[Scots College, Douai|Scots College at Douay]]. From there, it was supposed to have come into the possession of Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, who took over the MS when on a visit to the Scots College in the early 1750s.\n\n==The Lauder\u2013Scott correspondence==\n\nSoon after Sir Thomas saw the book, he wrote of it to [[Sir Walter Scott]], in a letter dated 1 June 1829. In this letter, Lauder highly commended the book, stating that several clan chiefs, such as Cluny MacPherson and McLeod, had derived their \"true and authentic\" tartans therefrom. Lauder described the manuscript in detail, stating that he had obtained drawings, in colour, of all of the tartans contained therein (about 66 in number) and sent some of these to Sir Walter Scott himself. In addition to material on tartans, the book also contained appendices on women's plaids ([[Highland dress#Historical descriptions|arisaids]]) and on hose and trews. In the end, Lauder urged the brothers to have the book published and made inquiries concerning costs and procedures to that end. A plan was adopted to publish it, illustrated by swatches of silk in the tartan colours and patterns.\n\nIn his reply of 5 June 1829 Scott expressed scepticism over the claims of both the brothers Sobieski and the manuscript itself, at the same time requesting that a copy of the MS be sent for investigation by competent authorities in antiquities. Among other things, he disputed the assertion that Lowlanders had ever worn tartans or plaids, questioned the lack of any corroborating evidence (including any in Bishop Lesley's writings even though Lesley was said to have been in possession at one time of the original upon which the present MS was based), and called into question the authenticity of the brothers. He also noted that the title \u2013 ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' \u2013 was, in his words, \"false Latin\".\n\nOn 20 July 1829 Sir Thomas replied to Sir Walter. In this letter, he describes the (alleged) 1571 original from which the 1721 copy, which he saw, is said to be derived and which was in the possession of the brothers' father in London. Sir Thomas then goes on to discuss the brothers' character, credibility, and society's opinion of them, admitting that the \"[[Quixotism]] of the two brothers must render these very unfortunate individuals for the introduction of a piece of antiquarian matter to the world\u2026\". He nevertheless reasserts his belief in the authenticity of the MS and goes on to discuss the \"false Latin\" and the presumed use of tartans in the Lowlands.\n\nIn a final letter in this exchange from Scott to Lauder, dated 19 November 1829, Scott rejected again the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and further rejected the notion that Lowlanders ever wore clan tartans. He went further and rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, stating that the \"idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2026\".\n\n==Publication of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''==\n\nThe ''Vestiarium'' was finally published in 1842. A summary of its contents follows.\n\n* Preface, in which is described the origin of the manuscripts, together with observations on the supposed author and date\n* Rolls of the Clans\n* Introduction\n* Text of the Vestiarium\n* The setts, stripes, and colours of the tartans, together with a listing of clans and families whose tartans are described\n* Colour plates - seventy five plates (in colour) illustrating the tartans of the clans and families mentioned in the previous section\n\n==The tartans==\n\nThe tartans presented in the ''Vestiarium'' were divided into two sections. First came the \"Highland clans\" and this was followed by \"Lowland Houses and Border Clans\". In the listing below, the clan name (with original spelling as it appeared in the VS) is followed by the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] number (TS#) and the (modern) thread count. Please note that these may not be the official clan tartans. For example, the tartan shown for [[Clan Campbell]], known as \"Campbell of Argyll\", was only worn by the Sixth Duke of Argyll. The standard Campbell tartan is the [[Black Watch]] tartan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814041325/http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Hieland clannes (Highland Clans)===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!width=\"20\"|Plate #\n!width=\"225\"|Clan/Tartan Name\n!width=\"70\"|Plate\n!width=\"325\"|Modern thread count derived from plate\n!width=\"70\"|Tartan derived from text\n!width=\"325\"|Modern thread count derived from text\n!width=\"70\"|[[Scottish Tartans Society]] #\n|-\n| 1 || [[Clan Stuart|The Clan Stewart]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2122\"/> || [[File:Clan Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''G'''4 R60 B8 R8 Bk12 Y2 Bk2 W2 Bk2 G20 R8 Bk2 R2 '''W'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2122\">''Forged Tartans'', p.21-22</ref> ||   || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 2 || [[Duke of Rothesay|Prince of Rothsay]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\">''Forged Tartans'', p.22-23</ref> || [[File:Prince of Rothesay tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''W'''4 R64 G4 R6 G4 R8 G32 R8 G32 R8 G4 R6 G4 R64 W2 R2 '''W'''4<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\"/> || N/A || N/A (impossible to accurately derive thread count from text)<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\"/> || TS1533\n|-\n| 3 || [[Clan Stuart|Clanne Stewart]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2627\">''Forged Tartans'', p.26-27</ref> || [[File:Ye principal clovris of ye clanne Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 W56 Bk6 W6 Bk6 W6 G26 R16 Bk2 R2 '''W'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2627\"/> || || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 4 || [[Clan Donald|MakDonnald of ye Ylis]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\">''Forged Tartans'', p.28</ref> || [[File:MacDonald of the Isles tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 B20 Bk24 G6 Bk2 G2 Bk2 G60 '''W'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\"/> || N/A || N/A (fine black lines could be in the blue portion, they are in the green portion in the text)<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\"/> || TS1366\n|-\n| 5 || [[Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald|Clan Raynald]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans29\">''Forged Tartans'', p.29</ref> || [[File:Clanranald tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''B'''10 R4 B30 R4 Bk16 G52 R6 G2 R4 G6 '''W'''6<ref name=\"ForgedTartans29\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 6 || [[Clan MacGregor|Clann Gregour]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans30\"/> || [[File:MacGregor tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]]|| '''R'''128 G36 R10 G16 '''W'''4<ref name=\"ForgedTartans30\">''Forged Tartans'', p.30</ref> ||  || same as plate || TS866\n|-\n| 8 || [[Clan MacDuff|Clan Makduffe]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans31\">''Forged Tartans'', p.31</ref> || [[File:MacDuff tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 G32 B12 Bk12 R48 Bk4 '''R'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans31\"/>||  || same as plate || TS1453\n|-\n| 9 || [[Clan Macpherson|Makanphersonis]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans32\">''Forged Tartans'', p.32</ref> || [[File:MacPherson tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''W'''6 R2 W60 Bk30 W6 Bk18 '''Y'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans32\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 10 || [[Clan Grant|Clann Grant, or clann Grauntacke]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3233\">''Forged Tartans'', p.32-33</ref> || [[File:Grant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''8 B4 R4 B4 R112 B32 R8 G2 R8 G72 R6 G2 '''R'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3233\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 11 || [[Clan Munro|Monrois]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans33\">''Forged Tartans'', p.33</ref> || [[File:Munro tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''Bk'''36 R8 Bk36 R64 '''W'''6<ref name=\"ForgedTartans33\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 12 || [[Clan MacLeod|Clann-Lewid]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3334\"/>|| [[File:MacLeod tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]]|| '''Bk'''16 Y2 Bk16 Y24 '''R'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3334\">''Forged Tartans'', p.33-34</ref> ||  || same as plate || TS1272\n|-\n| 13 || [[Clan Campbell]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3435\">''Forged Tartans'', p.34-35</ref> || [[File:Campbell tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum) (Stewart -

Though the review was initially published anonymously, now the authors are now known to have been Professor George Skene of [[Glasgow University]] and Rev. Dr. Mackay, the editor of the [[Highland Society of Scotland|Highland Society]]'s Gaelic Dictionary.\n\nThe ''Quarterly Review'' article was occasioned by the appearance of a book by John Sobieski and Charles Edward Stuart entitled ''The Tales of the Century''. These stories, although presented in fictional terms, lay out the authors' claims to be direct descendants of Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender. The ''Quarterly Review'' article, while nominally a response to these claims, in fact mainly consisted of an examination of the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''.\n\nIn 1848, John Sobieski Stuart replied to the ''Quarterly Review'' article with a treatise of his own entitled ''The Genuineness of the Vestiarium Scoticum''. In this reply, Stuart offered the 1721 edition for inspection. In his part, Skene expressed a desire for the original manuscript, which was said to have once belonged to Bishop Ross, to be exhibited. In the end, no record of anyone examining the 1721 copy at that time exists, and no one, other than the Sobieski Stuart brothers, ever saw the Ross copy.\n\nIn 1895, the ''Glasgow Herald'' published a series of articles titled \"The ''Vestiarium Scoticum'', is it a forgery?\" authored by Andrew Ross. Ross was able to locate the 1721 copy, but not any earlier manuscripts. He gave a detailed description of the 1721 copy, and had it subjected to chemical testing by Stevenson Macadam, a chemist. Macadam reported that the \"document [bore] evidence of having been treated with chemical agents in order to give the writing a more aged appearance than it is entitled to\". He concluded that \"the manuscript cannot be depended upon as an ancient document\".\n\nThis 1721 copy was also presented for examination to a Mr. Robert Irvine, the director of a chemical firm who reported that it was \"impossible to arrive at any accurate conclusion pointing to the age of the writing\".\n\nIn earlier years, there was some discussion of publishing a second edition of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' (the first edition had a press run of only several dozen copies), but nothing came of these discussions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ossian]]\n* [[Manuscripts of Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and of Zelen\u00e1 Hora]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* John Telfer Dunbar, ''History of highland dress: A definitive study of the history of Scottish costume and tartan, both civil and military, including weapons'', {{ISBN|0-7134-1894-X}}\n* Hugh Trevor-Roper, ''The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland'', in ''The Invention of Tradition'' editors: Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger.

With an Introduction and Notes, by [[John Sobieski Stuart]]'') was a book which was first published in 1842 by [[William Tait (publisher)|William Tait]] of [[Edinburgh]] in a limited edition. John Telfer Dunbar, in his seminal work ''History of Highland Dress,'' referred to it as \"probably the most controversial costume book ever written\".\n\nThe book itself is purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a 15th-century manuscript on the clan tartans of Scottish families. Shortly after its publication it was denounced as a forgery, and the \"Stuart\" brothers who brought it forth were also denounced as impostors for claiming to be the grandsons of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. It is generally accepted today that neither the brothers themselves nor the ''Vestiarium'' are what they were purported to be.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scottish Tartans Resources: Vestiarium Scoticum - 1842|url=http://scottishtartans.org/resources/vestiarium.php|website=Scottishtartans.org|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the role of the book in the history of Scottish [[tartan]]s is immense, with many of the designs and patterns contained therein passing into the realm of \"official\" [[clan]] tartans.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe 1842 edition of the ''Vestiarium'' had its beginnings in the late 1820s, when the Sobieski Stuart brothers, then residents of [[Moray, Scotland]], produced a copy of a document containing tartan patterns and showed it to their host, Sir [[Thomas Dick Lauder]], [[Baronet|Bt]]. This manuscript, however, was not the one that the brothers claimed to be the basis for the later publication of the ''Vestiarium''.\n\nAs explained in the Preface to the 1842 edition (which is extensively excerpted in Dunbar's ''History of Highland Dress''), the copy which Sir Thomas saw, now known as the Cromarty MS, which bore the date 1721 on the first page and with the title ''Liber Vestiarium Scotia'', was said by its possessors to have been obtained from a certain John Ross of Cromarty, and was said also by them to be an inferior copy of an earlier manuscript.\n\nIn this same Preface, it is claimed that the 1842 edition is based on an original manuscript, now known as the Douay MS, whose date was claimed to be 1571 (or earlier), which was at that time in the possession of [[John Lesley]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]]. This Douay MS is said by the author of the Preface to be the \"oldest and most perfect\" copy of the ''Vestiarium''. Having once been in the possession of Bishop Ross, it had found its way subsequently into the library of the [[Scots College, Douai|Scots College at Douay]]. From there, it was supposed to have come into the possession of Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, who took over the MS when on a visit to the Scots College in the early 1750s.\n\n==The Lauder\u2013Scott correspondence==\n\nSoon after Sir Thomas saw the book, he wrote of it to [[Sir Walter Scott]], in a letter dated 1 June 1829. In this letter, Lauder highly commended the book, stating that several clan chiefs, such as Cluny MacPherson and McLeod, had derived their \"true and authentic\" tartans therefrom. Lauder described the manuscript in detail, stating that he had obtained drawings, in colour, of all of the tartans contained therein (about 66 in number) and sent some of these to Sir Walter Scott himself. In addition to material on tartans, the book also contained appendices on women's plaids ([[Highland dress#Historical descriptions|arisaids]]) and on hose and trews. In the end, Lauder urged the brothers to have the book published and made inquiries concerning costs and procedures to that end. A plan was adopted to publish it, illustrated by swatches of silk in the tartan colours and patterns.\n\nIn his reply of 5 June 1829 Scott expressed scepticism over the claims of both the brothers Sobieski and the manuscript itself, at the same time requesting that a copy of the MS be sent for investigation by competent authorities in antiquities. Among other things, he disputed the assertion that Lowlanders had ever worn tartans or plaids, questioned the lack of any corroborating evidence (including any in Bishop Lesley's writings even though Lesley was said to have been in possession at one time of the original upon which the present MS was based), and called into question the authenticity of the brothers. He also noted that the title \u2013 ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' \u2013 was, in his words, \"false Latin\".\n\nOn 20 July 1829 Sir Thomas replied to Sir Walter. In this letter, he describes the (alleged) 1571 original from which the 1721 copy, which he saw, is said to be derived and which was in the possession of the brothers' father in London. Sir Thomas then goes on to discuss the brothers' character, credibility, and society's opinion of them, admitting that the \"[[Quixotism]] of the two brothers must render these very unfortunate individuals for the introduction of a piece of antiquarian matter to the world\u2026\". He nevertheless reasserts his belief in the authenticity of the MS and goes on to discuss the \"false Latin\" and the presumed use of tartans in the Lowlands.\n\nIn a final letter in this exchange from Scott to Lauder, dated 19 November 1829, Scott rejected again the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and further rejected the notion that Lowlanders ever wore clan tartans. He went further and rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, stating that the \"idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2026\".\n\n==Publication of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''==\n\nThe ''Vestiarium'' was finally published in 1842. A summary of its contents follows.\n\n* Preface, in which is described the origin of the manuscripts, together with observations on the supposed author and date\n* Rolls of the Clans\n* Introduction\n* Text of the Vestiarium\n* The setts, stripes, and colours of the tartans, together with a listing of clans and families whose tartans are described\n* Colour plates - seventy five plates (in colour) illustrating the tartans of the clans and families mentioned in the previous section\n\n==The tartans==\n\nThe tartans presented in the ''Vestiarium'' were divided into two sections. First came the \"Highland clans\" and this was followed by \"Lowland Houses and Border Clans\". In the listing below, the clan name (with original spelling as it appeared in the VS) is followed by the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] number (TS#) and the (modern) thread count. Please note that these may not be the official clan tartans. For example, the tartan shown for [[Clan Campbell]], known as \"Campbell of Argyll\", was only worn by the Sixth Duke of Argyll. The standard Campbell tartan is the [[Black Watch]] tartan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814041325/http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Hieland clannes (Highland Clans)===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!width=\"20\"|Plate #\n!width=\"225\"|Clan/Tartan Name\n!width=\"70\"|Plate\n!width=\"325\"|Modern thread count derived from plate\n!width=\"70\"|Tartan derived from text\n!width=\"325\"|Modern thread count derived from text\n!width=\"70\"|[[Scottish Tartans Society]] #\n|-\n| 1 || [[Clan Stuart|The Clan Stewart]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2122\"/> || [[File:Clan Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''G'''4 R60 B8 R8 Bk12 Y2 Bk2 W2 Bk2 G20 R8 Bk2 R2 '''W'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2122\">''Forged Tartans'', p.21-22</ref> ||   || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 2 || [[Duke of Rothesay|Prince of Rothsay]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\">''Forged Tartans'', p.22-23</ref> || [[File:Prince of Rothesay tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''W'''4 R64 G4 R6 G4 R8 G32 R8 G32 R8 G4 R6 G4 R64 W2 R2 '''W'''4<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\"/> || N/A || N/A (impossible to accurately derive thread count from text)<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2223\"/> || TS1533\n|-\n| 3 || [[Clan Stuart|Clanne Stewart]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2627\">''Forged Tartans'', p.26-27</ref> || [[File:Ye principal clovris of ye clanne Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 W56 Bk6 W6 Bk6 W6 G26 R16 Bk2 R2 '''W'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans2627\"/> || || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 4 || [[Clan Donald|MakDonnald of ye Ylis]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\">''Forged Tartans'', p.28</ref> || [[File:MacDonald of the Isles tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 B20 Bk24 G6 Bk2 G2 Bk2 G60 '''W'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\"/> || N/A || N/A (fine black lines could be in the blue portion, they are in the green portion in the text)<ref name=\"ForgedTartans28\"/> || TS1366\n|-\n| 5 || [[Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald|Clan Raynald]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans29\">''Forged Tartans'', p.29</ref> || [[File:Clanranald tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''B'''10 R4 B30 R4 Bk16 G52 R6 G2 R4 G6 '''W'''6<ref name=\"ForgedTartans29\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 6 || [[Clan MacGregor|Clann Gregour]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans30\"/> || [[File:MacGregor tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]]|| '''R'''128 G36 R10 G16 '''W'''4<ref name=\"ForgedTartans30\">''Forged Tartans'', p.30</ref> ||  || same as plate || TS866\n|-\n| 8 || [[Clan MacDuff|Clan Makduffe]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans31\">''Forged Tartans'', p.31</ref> || [[File:MacDuff tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''6 G32 B12 Bk12 R48 Bk4 '''R'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans31\"/>||  || same as plate || TS1453\n|-\n| 9 || [[Clan Macpherson|Makanphersonis]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans32\">''Forged Tartans'', p.32</ref> || [[File:MacPherson tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''W'''6 R2 W60 Bk30 W6 Bk18 '''Y'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans32\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 10 || [[Clan Grant|Clann Grant, or clann Grauntacke]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3233\">''Forged Tartans'', p.32-33</ref> || [[File:Grant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''R'''8 B4 R4 B4 R112 B32 R8 G2 R8 G72 R6 G2 '''R'''8<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3233\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 11 || [[Clan Munro|Monrois]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans33\">''Forged Tartans'', p.33</ref> || [[File:Munro tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]] || '''Bk'''36 R8 Bk36 R64 '''W'''6<ref name=\"ForgedTartans33\"/> ||  || same as plate ||\n|-\n| 12 || [[Clan MacLeod|Clann-Lewid]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3334\"/>|| [[File:MacLeod tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|70px]]|| '''Bk'''16 Y2 Bk16 Y24 '''R'''2<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3334\">''Forged Tartans'', p.33-34</ref> ||  || same as plate || TS1272\n|-\n| 13 || [[Clan Campbell]]<ref name=\"ForgedTartans3435\">''Forged Tartans'', p.34-35</ref> || [[File:Campbell tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum) (Stewart -

Though the review was initially published anonymously, now the authors are now known to have been Professor George Skene of [[Glasgow University]] and Rev. Dr. Mackay, the editor of the [[Highland Society of Scotland|Highland Society]]'s Gaelic Dictionary.\n\nThe ''Quarterly Review'' article was occasioned by the appearance of a book by John Sobieski and Charles Edward Stuart entitled ''The Tales of the Century''. These stories, although presented in fictional terms, lay out the authors' claims to be direct descendants of Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender. The ''Quarterly Review'' article, while nominally a response to these claims, in fact mainly consisted of an examination of the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''.\n\nIn 1848, John Sobieski Stuart replied to the ''Quarterly Review'' article with a treatise of his own entitled ''The Genuineness of the Vestiarium Scoticum''. In this reply, Stuart offered the 1721 edition for inspection. In his part, Skene expressed a desire for the original manuscript, which was said to have once belonged to Bishop Ross, to be exhibited. In the end, no record of anyone examining the 1721 copy at that time exists, and no one, other than the Sobieski Stuart brothers, ever saw the Ross copy.\n\nIn 1895, the ''Glasgow Herald'' published a series of articles titled \"The ''Vestiarium Scoticum'', is it a forgery?\" authored by Andrew Ross. Ross was able to locate the 1721 copy, but not any earlier manuscripts. He gave a detailed description of the 1721 copy, and had it subjected to chemical testing by Stevenson Macadam, a chemist. Macadam reported that the \"document [bore] evidence of having been treated with chemical agents in order to give the writing a more aged appearance than it is entitled to\". He concluded that \"the manuscript cannot be depended upon as an ancient document\".\n\nThis 1721 copy was also presented for examination to a Mr. Robert Irvine, the director of a chemical firm who reported that it was \"impossible to arrive at any accurate conclusion pointing to the age of the writing\".\n\nIn earlier years, there was some discussion of publishing a second edition of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' (the first edition had a press run of only several dozen copies), but nothing came of these discussions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ossian]]\n* [[Manuscripts of Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and of Zelen\u00e1 Hora]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* John Telfer Dunbar, ''History of highland dress: A definitive study of the history of Scottish costume and tartan, both civil and military, including weapons'', {{ISBN|0-7134-1894-X}}\n* Hugh Trevor-Roper, ''The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland'', in ''The Invention of Tradition'' editors: Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger.
