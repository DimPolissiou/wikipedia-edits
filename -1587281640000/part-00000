Then the pattern as well as the music changes, going up a [[half step]] in the key of the song ([[chromatic modulation]]), after two stanzas, first from [[A-flat minor]], to [[A minor]].\n\nFor the final three millennia, now in [[B flat minor]], the tone of the song turns apocalyptic: the year 7510 marks the date by which the [[Second Coming]] will have happened, and the [[Last Judgment]] occurs one millennium later. By 9595, with the song now in [[B minor]], the [[Earth]] becomes completely depleted of resources, potentially resulting in the death of all life.\n\nThe song ends in the year 10,000. By that time, man has become extinct.

[[Lithography]] of 1836.]]\nIn his famous ''Instruction'' (also known as ''The Testament'') to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the [[Cumans|Polovtsi]]. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin [[Oleg of Chernigov|Oleg]], but after Volodymyr was sent by his father to rule [[Chernigov]] and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Volodymyr and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.\n\nFrom 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of [[Pereiaslav|Pereyaslav]], although he also controlled [[Rostov]], [[Suzdal]], and other northern provinces (see [[Principality of Pereyaslavl]]). In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of [[Ancient Rus'|Rus']] in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Volodymyr initiated three princely [[congress]]es, the most important being held at [[Lyubech]] in 1097 and [[Dolobsk]] in 1103.\n\nIn 1107 he defeated [[Boniak]], a [[Cuman]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who led an invasion on [[Kievan Rus']]. When [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] died in 1113, the [[Kiev]]an populace revolted and summoned Volodymyr to the capital. The same year he entered Kyiv to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his ''Instruction'', he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of [[Ancient Rus]], which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVolodymyr Monomakh is buried in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Kyiv]]. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the [[golden age]] of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from [[Constantinople]] to Rus of such precious [[relic]]s as the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] and the Volodymyr/Muscovite crown called [[Monomakh's Cap]].\n\n== Marriages and children ==\nVolodymyr married three times. Some sources cite his first wife as [[Gytha of Wessex]], daughter of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold of England]] who had fallen at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] in 1066 and of [[Edith Swannesha]]. Problems exist in that none of the sources citing this are contemporary, and none of the Russian sources cite the name of his first wife as the daughter of Harold Godwinson. They had at least five children:\n\n* [[Mstislav I of Kiev]] (1 June 1076 \u2013 14 April 1132)\n* Izyaslav Volodymyrovych, [[Prince of Kursk]] (c. 1077 \u2013 6 September 1096)\n* Svyatoslav Volodymyrovych, [[Prince of Smolensk]] and [[Pereyaslav]] (c. 1080 \u2013 16 March 1114)\n* [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] (1082 \u2013 18 February 1139)\n* [[Viacheslav I of Kiev]] (1083 \u2013 2 February 1154)\n\nThe following daughter has been attributed to either the first or the second wife:\n* Marina Volodymyrivna (d. 1146). Married [[Leon Diogenes]], a pretender to the throne of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who claimed to be a son of [[Romanos IV]] and who rose to the rank of khan of the [[Cumans]] in [[Ossetia]].\n\n[[Image:\u041e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445 \u0412.\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monomakh rests after hunting (painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], c. 1900).]]\n\nVolodymyr's second wife, Eufimia, is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1989|pp=416\u2014417}}  The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' and the \"Testament of Volodymyr Monomakh\" record her date of death as 7 May 1107. However the ''Chronicle'' does not mention her name. This marriage produced at least six children:\n* [[Roman Vladimirovich|Roman]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 6 January 1119)\n* [[Eufemia of Kiev]] (d. 4 April 1139). Married [[Coloman of Hungary]].\n* Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of [[Hrodna|Gorodno]]. According to older historians her husband was a son of [[David Igorevich]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 1113), but this theory was rejected.<ref>Oleg \u0141atyszonek, ''Wczesno\u015bredniowieczne ksi\u0119stwo grodzie\u0144skie w historiografii ostatniego dwudziestolecia'', p. 10.</ref>\n* [[Yuri Dolgoruki|Yuri]] (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157).\n* [[Andrey Vladimirovich|Andrew]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (11 July 1102 \u2013 1141).\n\nVolodymyr's third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the [[Cumans]]. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the [[Kipchaks]], a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin.\n\nHowever the ''Primary Chronicle'' identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Volodymyr negotiating the marriage in name of his son.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified

''[[Basil (name)|Basileios]]'') (1053 \u2013 19 May 1125) reigned as [[Grand Prince]] of [[Kievan Rus']] from 1113 to 1125.\n\n== Family ==\nHe was the son of [[Vsevolod of Kiev|Vsevolod I]] (married in 1046) by a relative of Byzantine emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachos]], from whom Vladimir obtained his sobriquet.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1989|pp=416\u2014417}} Contemporary Byzantine naming practice allowed the adoption of a maternal surname if the mother's family was perceived to be of a more exalted origin than that of the father.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1398}}\n\n== Reign ==\n[[File:Instruction of Vladimir II Monomakh.jpeg|thumb|''The Testament of Vladimir Monomakh to Children, 1125''. [[Lithography]] of 1836.]]\nIn his famous ''Instruction'' (also known as ''The Testament'') to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the [[Cumans|Polovtsi]]. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin [[Oleg of Chernigov|Oleg]], but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule [[Chernigov]] and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.\n\nFrom 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of [[Pereiaslav|Pereyaslav]], although he also controlled [[Rostov]], [[Suzdal]], and other northern provinces (see [[Principality of Pereyaslavl]]). In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of [[Ancient Rus'|Rus']] in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely [[congress]]es, the most important being held at [[Lyubech]] in 1097 and [[Dolobsk]] in 1103.\n\nIn 1107 he defeated [[Boniak]], a [[Cuman]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who led an invasion on [[Kievan Rus']]. When [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] died in 1113, the [[Kiev]]an populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his ''Instruction'', he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of [[Ancient Rus]], which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVladimir Monomakh is buried in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]]. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the [[golden age]] of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from [[Constantinople]] to Rus of such precious [[relic]]s as the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called [[Monomakh's Cap]].\n\n== Marriages and children ==\nVladimir married three times. Some sources cite his first wife as [[Gytha of Wessex]], daughter of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold of England]] who had fallen at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] in 1066 and of [[Edith Swannesha]]. Problems exist in that none of the sources citing this are contemporary, and none of the Russian sources cite the name of his first wife as the daughter of Harold Godwinson. They had at least five children:\n\n* [[Mstislav I of Kiev]] (1 June 1076 \u2013 14 April 1132)\n* Izyaslav Vladimirovich, [[Prince of Kursk]] (c. 1077 \u2013 6 September 1096)\n* Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, [[Prince of Smolensk]] and [[Pereyaslav]] (c. 1080 \u2013 16 March 1114)\n* [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] (1082 \u2013 18 February 1139)\n* [[Viacheslav I of Kiev]] (1083 \u2013 2 February 1154)\n\nThe following daughter has been attributed to either the first or the second wife:\n* Marina Vladimirovna (d. 1146). Married [[Leon Diogenes]], a pretender to the throne of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who claimed to be a son of [[Romanos IV]] and who rose to the rank of khan of the [[Cumans]] in [[Ossetia]].\n\n[[Image:\u041e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445 \u0412.\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monomakh rests after hunting (painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], c. 1900).]]\n\nVladimir's second wife, Eufimia, is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1989|pp=416\u2014417}}  The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' and the \"Testament of Vladimir Monomakh\" record her date of death as 7 May 1107. However the ''Chronicle'' does not mention her name. This marriage produced at least six children:\n* [[Roman Vladimirovich|Roman]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 6 January 1119)\n* [[Eufemia of Kiev]] (d. 4 April 1139). Married [[Coloman of Hungary]].\n* Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of [[Hrodna|Gorodno]]. According to older historians her husband was a son of [[David Igorevich]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 1113), but this theory was rejected.<ref>Oleg \u0141atyszonek, ''Wczesno\u015bredniowieczne ksi\u0119stwo grodzie\u0144skie w historiografii ostatniego dwudziestolecia'', p. 10.</ref>\n* [[Yuri Dolgoruki|Yuri]] (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157).\n* [[Andrey Vladimirovich|Andrew]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (11 July 1102 \u2013 1141).\n\nVladimir's third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the [[Cumans]]. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the [[Kipchaks]], a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin.\n\nHowever the ''Primary Chronicle'' identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Vladimir negotiating the marriage in name of his son.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified remains unclear.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black Sea]]\n* [[Council of Liubech]]\n* [[List of Ukrainian rulers]]\n* [[List of Russian rulers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Dimnik |first=Martin |year=2016 |title=Power Politics in Kievan Rus': Vladimir Monomakh and His Dynasty, 1054\u20131246 |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |isbn=978-0-88844-202-4 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Kazhdan |first=Alexander |title=Rus'-Byzantine Princely Marriages in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries |journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies |year=1989 |publisher=Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute |volume=12/13|pages=414\u2013429|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{MLCC |external links=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/RUSSIA,%20Rurik.htm#VladimirMonomachdied1125B |title-date= |title= RUSSIA Rurik: Vladimir Monomach died 1125|date=August 2012}}\n* {{cite book |last=Nenarokova |first=Maria  |year=2008 |chapter=Vladimir Monomakh\u2019s Instruction: An Old Russian Pedagogic Treatise |editor-first=Feros Ruys |editor-last=Juanita |title=What Nature Does Not Teach: Didactic Literature in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods | publisher=Turnhout, Brepols |pages=109\u2013128}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Arkadii Zhukovsky, [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CV%5CO%5CVolodymyrMonomakh.htm Volodymyr Monomakh in the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 5 (1993)]\n* [http://www.arco-iris.com/George/monomakh.htm English biography]\n* [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/karamzin/kar02_07.htm Karamzin's account of Monomakh]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050218205527/http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Monomakh.html Instruction of Vladimir Monomakh]\n* [http://www.dur.ac.uk/a.k.harrington/vladmono.html The Pouchenie of Vladimir Monomakh] www.dur.ac.uk\n* (Russian) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015040459/http://www.monomah.vladimir.ru/pouchenie.htm The Pouchenie of Vladimir Monomakh] monomah.vladimir.ru\n*{{cite web|last=Ross |first= Kelley L.  |origyear=1990 |year=2012 |url=http://www.friesian.com/russia.htm |title=Successors of Rome: Russia, 862-Present| publisher=Friesian School, Fourth Series|accessdate=}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|Rurikovich||1053||1125||name=Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Grand Prince of Kiev]]|years=1113\u20131125}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav I]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vladimir 02}}\n[[Category:Princes of Rostov]]\n[[Category:Princes of Chernigov]]\n[[Category:Princes of Pereyaslavl]]\n[[Category:Grand Princes of Kiev]]\n[[Category:1053 births]]\n[[Category:1125 deaths]]\n[[Category:Rurik dynasty]]\n[[Category:Burials at Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]\n[[Category:11th-century princes in Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:12th-century princes in Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs]]\n", "name_user": "VBoden", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_II_Monomakh"}

SAD is one of the most basic measurements in ecology and is used very often, therefore many different methods of measurement and analysis have developed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Measurement==\nThere are several methods for measuring abundance. An example of this is Semi-Quantitive Abundance ratings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Methods of Environmental Assessment|last=Morris|first=Peter|publisher=University College London Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=236}}</ref> These are measurement methods which involve estimation based on viewing a specific area of a designated size.<ref name=\":1\" /> The two Semi-Quantitive Abundance ratings used are known as the D.A.F.O.R, and the A.C.F.O.R.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \nThe A.C.F.O.R. scale is as follows: \n*'''A''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Abundant\" within the given area.\n*'''C''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Common\" within the given area.\n*'''F''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Frequent\" within the given area.\n*'''O''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Occasional\" within the given area\n*'''R''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Rare\" within the given area.\n\nD.A.F.O.R scale:\n\n* '''D''' - Species observed is \"Dominant\" in a given area.\n* '''A''' - Species observed is \"Abundant\" in a given area.\n* '''F''' - Species observed is \"Frequent\" in a given area.\n* '''O''' - Species observed is \"Occasional\" in a given area.\n* '''R''' - Species observed is \"Rare\" in a given area.\n\nThese methods are great for getting a rough estimate of the species abundance in a designated area (quadrant). However, they are not exact, or objective measurements. Therefore if another method of measuring abundance is available, it should be used.

An example of this is Semi-Quantitive Abundance ratings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Methods of Environmental Assessment|last=Morris|first=Peter|publisher=University College London Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=236}}</ref> These are measurement methods which involve estimation based on viewing a specific area of a designated size.<ref name=\":1\" /> The two Semi-Quantitive Abundance ratings used are known as the D.A.F.O.R, and the A.C.F.O.R.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \nThe A.C.F.O.R. scale is as follows: \n*'''A''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Abundant\" within the given area.\n*'''C''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Common\" within the given area.\n*'''F''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Frequent\" within the given area.\n*'''O''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Occasional\" within the given area\n*'''R''' \u2013 Species observed is \"Rare\" within the given area.\n\nD.A.F.O.R scale:\n\n* '''D''' - Species observed is \"Dominant\" in a given area.\n* '''A''' - Species observed is \"Abundant\" in a given area.\n* '''F''' - Species observed is \"Frequent\" in a given area.\n* '''O''' - Species observed is \"Occasional\" in a given area.\n* '''R''' - Species observed is \"Rare\" in a given area.\n\nThese methods are great for getting a rough estimate of the species abundance in a designated area (quadrant). However, they are not exact, or objective measurements. Therefor if another method of measuring abundance is available, it should be used. This will lead to more useful and quantifiable data.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Ecology}}\n* [[Abundance estimation]]\n* [[Cover-abundance]]\n* [[Living Planet Index]]\n* [[Occupancy\u2013abundance relationship]]\n* [[Plant cover]]\n* [[Range (biology)]]\n* [[Relative abundance distribution]]\n* [[Species richness]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|abundance}}\n*[http://biologicalposteriors.blogspot.com/2011/05/abundance-in-ecology.html \"Abundance in ecology\"] (article, with works cited)\n\n{{modelling ecosystems|expanded=other}}\n\n[[Category:Ecology terminology]]\n[[Category:Biodiversity]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(ecology)"}

It is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[Tualatin Valley]] and is among the main cities that make up the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. The city's population was 89,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the county and the sixth-largest city in Oregon.<ref name=factfinder>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table|title=American Factfinder|author= |date=|work=2010 Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. It encompasses the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred growth in the small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n[[File:City Park Beaverton Oregon.JPG|thumb|City Park in Beaverton]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\n===Native Americans===\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | title = Beaverton History\n  | publisher = City of Beaverton\n  | accessdate = September 7, 2007\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | archivedate = September 28, 2007\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early settlers====\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n====Beginning of the town====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor.\nMany major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Automobile dealerships====\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n====Movies and airplanes====\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\n====Library====\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n====Mass transit====\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.  In 1990, voters approved funding for [[MAX Blue Line#Westside MAX|Westside MAX]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mayer|first=James|date=November 8, 1990|title=Light-rail bond approved, but Tri-Met worries not over|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=C4}}</ref> Construction of the line began in 1993 and was completed in 1998.  Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].

It is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[Tualatin Valley]] and is among the main cities that make up the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. The city's population was 89,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the county and the sixth-largest city in Oregon.<ref name=factfinder>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table|title=American Factfinder|author= |date=|work=2010 Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. It encompasses the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred the growth of the area's small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n[[File:City Park Beaverton Oregon.JPG|thumb|City Park in Beaverton]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\n===Native Americans===\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | title = Beaverton History\n  | publisher = City of Beaverton\n  | accessdate = September 7, 2007\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | archivedate = September 28, 2007\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early settlers====\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n====Beginning of the town====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor.\nMany major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Automobile dealerships====\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n====Movies and airplanes====\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\n====Library====\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n====Mass transit====\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.

Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].  All but the last of these (the transit center) are located along [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] formerly owned by [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and originally by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]], which provided [[interurban]] service through Beaverton until 1933.  The present-day light rail service (MAX) is operated by TriMet, which also continues to operate several bus routes serving Beaverton and the surrounding communities.  Since early 2009, Beaverton has also been served by [[commuter rail]] service, TriMet's [[Westside Express Service]] (WES), running south to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] via [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]].\n\n===21st century=== <!-- note forward reference to this section in intro -->\n{{Update|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:DennisDoyle.JPG|thumb|right|Mayor Denny Doyle]]\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:Southwest corner of The Round - Beaverton, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Round in 2009]]\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland.<ref name=\"county\">[http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm County Board Approves Interim Plan with Beaverton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818231719/http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}, a December 2004 article from the [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] website</ref>  The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective,<ref name=\"county\" /> the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services.

The series is animated in Ireland by [[Brown Bag Films]] and uses British voice actors. The TV series is based on American-Canadian children's books written by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of [[Meomi Design]] Inc. The show follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized [[anthropomorphic]] animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from which they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles. Although its technology is fictional, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are based on real marine animals in their natural habitats. ''The Octonauts'' has been renewed for a 5th series that will \"introduce new environments, [...] characters and a new fleet of vehicles\" to be released sometime in 2020.<ref>https://www.awn.com/news/silvergate-media-produce-fashion-ally-nick</ref> The subject matter is reminiscent of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/16/octonauts3.shtml interview with executive producer Kurt Mueller] BBC Press Office</ref> blended with [[Jacques Cousteau]].\n\n==Books==\nThe original books were first published in the US by Immedium in 2006, and were republished in the UK by [[Harper Collins]] in 2009. Six titles by Meomi have been published:\n\n*''The Octonauts & the Only Lonely Monster'', about an [[Architeuthis]] (Giant Squid).\n*''The Octonauts & the Sea of Shade'', about a world where everyone's shadows have gone missing.\n*''The Octonauts & the Frown Fish'', about a glum-looking [[catfish]].\n*''The Octonauts & the Great Ghost Reef'', about [[coral bleaching]].\n*''The Octonauts Explore the Great Big Ocean'', about the search for Tunip the Vegimal's home.\n*''The Octonauts & the Growing Goldfish'', about Dunkie, a giant goldfish who won't stop growing.\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2010, ''The Octonauts'' was adapted into a 52 episode [[CGI animation|CGI animated]] television series co-produced by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] and Brown Bag Films. It first aired in the UK on 4 October 2010 on CBeebies, a [[BBC]] television channel for the under 7's. The first series ended in February 2011, but continued to be aired as repeats. A second series of 22 episodes commenced in November 2012.\n\n''The Octonauts'' had its US premiere on the [[Disney Channel]] in January 2012, however many of the characters' voices were redubbed to give them American accents\u2014Hispanic in the case of Peso and Pinto\u2014although Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Prof. Inkling retained their original British voices.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/review/RRB8I9IN1QVD6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071651BY Amazon customer review]</ref> It has also been shown in Ireland ([[RT\u00c9 Two]]), Canada ([[Treehouse TV]]), and Australia ([[ABC Television]]). The show has been translated and shown in French ([[TF1]]), Spanish and Portuguese ([[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids Latin America]]), Finnish ([[YLE TV2]]), Welsh ([[S4C]]) and Slovakian ([[Dvojka|STV 2]]).<ref>[http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/c_level2.shtml?programme_id=500613693 S4C Octonots page.]</ref>\n\nThe series was made with the help of [[marine biologist]]s Dr. Lara A. Ferry-Graham and Dr. Michael H. Graham, who had previously worked on ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\"/>\n\nThe TV show is episodic, with each 11 minute episode seeing them encountering an unusual but real sea creature as they explore strange underwater worlds.

The series is animated in Ireland by [[Brown Bag Films]] and uses British voice actors. The TV series is based on American-Canadian children's books written by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of [[Meomi Design]] Inc. The show follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized [[anthropomorphic]] animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from which they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles. Although its technology is fictional, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are based on real marine animals in their natural habitats. ''The Octonauts'' has been renewed for a 5th series that will \"introduce new environments, [...] characters and a new fleet of vehicles\" to be released sometime in 2020.<ref>https://www.awn.com/news/silvergate-media-produce-fashion-ally-nick</ref> The subject matter is reminiscent of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/16/octonauts3.shtml interview with executive producer Kurt Mueller] BBC Press Office</ref> blended with [[Jacques Cousteau]].\n\n==Books==\nThe original books were first published in the US by Immedium in 2006, and were republished in the UK by [[Harper Collins]] in 2009. Six titles by Meomi have been published:\n\n*''The Octonauts & the Only Lonely Monster'', about an [[Architeuthis]] (Giant Squid).\n*''The Octonauts & the Sea of Shade'', about a world where everyone's shadows have gone missing.\n*''The Octonauts & the Frown Fish'', about a glum-looking [[catfish]].\n*''The Octonauts & the Great Ghost Reef'', about [[coral bleaching]].\n*''The Octonauts Explore the Great Big Ocean'', about the search for Tunip the Vegimal's home.\n*''The Octonauts & the Growing Goldfish'', about Dunkie, a giant goldfish who won't stop growing.\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2010, ''The Octonauts'' was adapted into a 52 episode [[CGI animation|CGI animated]] television series co-produced by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] and Brown Bag Films. It first aired in the UK on 4 October 2010 on CBeebies, a [[BBC]] television channel for the under 7's. The first series ended in February 2011, but continued to be aired as repeats. A second series of 22 episodes commenced in November 2012.\n\n''The Octonauts'' had its US premiere on the [[Disney Channel]] in January 2012, however many of the characters' voices were redubbed to give them American accents\u2014Hispanic in the case of Peso and Pinto\u2014although Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Prof. Inkling retained their original British voices.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/review/RRB8I9IN1QVD6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071651BY Amazon customer review]</ref> It has also been shown in Ireland ([[RT\u00c9 Two]]), Canada ([[Treehouse TV]]), and Australia ([[ABC Television]]). The show has been translated and shown in French ([[TF1]]), Spanish and Portuguese ([[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids Latin America]]), Finnish ([[YLE TV2]]), Welsh ([[S4C]]) and Slovakian ([[Dvojka|STV 2]]).<ref>[http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/c_level2.shtml?programme_id=500613693 S4C Octonots page.]</ref>\n\nThe series was made with the help of [[marine biologist]]s Dr. Lara A. Ferry-Graham and Dr. Michael H. Graham, who had previously worked on ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\"/>\n\nThe TV show is episodic, with each 11 minute episode seeing them encountering an unusual but real sea creature as they explore strange underwater worlds. Often they must discover a vital biological or behavioral fact about that creature to rescue it or themselves from danger. The stories usually feature three main characters: Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Peso, with the other five Octonauts acting in supporting roles.\n\nIn the TV series they use five sea-creature-inspired underwater vehicles called GUP-A to GUP-E, the pedal driven GUP-F, driven by Captain Barnacles and Kwazii, which appears in Episode 10 of Series 1 (''The Speedy Sailfish''), the narwhal-shaped submarine Gup-S that can split so one half goes over land, the train-shaped vegimal-driven Gup-V, and the powerful and sturdy tracked GUP-X, first appearing in Episode 52 of Series 1 (''The Great Christmas Rescue'').\n\nThe opening theme tune finishes with the chant \"Explore! - Rescue! - Protect!\", the Octonauts\u2019 motto.\n\n===TV spin-off books===\nA series of shorter books based on individual episodes from the TV series is being published by [[Simon & Schuster]].\nThese titles can be distinguished by the \"As seen on TV\" label on the covers and are not written or illustrated by Meomi.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1XHWYXRVLRA8/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857072366&nodeID=266239 Amazon customer review]</ref> The books have the same titles as the episodes they are based on.\n\n==Reception==\nThe TV series was well received when shown on CBeebies in the UK and by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in Australia.
