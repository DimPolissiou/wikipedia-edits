First, he worked drawing posters for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] and the [[War Production Board]]. Then, in 1943, he joined the Army as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] and was commander of the Animation Department of the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], where he wrote films that included ''[[Your Job in Germany]]'', a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; ''[[Our Job in Japan]]''; and the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of adult army training films.

He published most of his books through [[Random House]] in North America and [[William Collins, Sons]] (later [[HarperCollins]]) internationally. He wrote many, including such favorites as ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1955), ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956), ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' (1957), ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1957), and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the [[Caldecott Medal]] nor the [[Newbery Medal]]. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''Bartholomew and the Oobleck'' (1949), and ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950). Dr. Seuss also wrote the [[musical film|musical]] and [[fantasy film]] ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.]]'', which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in ''[[Redbook]]'' Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as ''The Sneetches and Other Stories'') or reworked into independent books (''If I Ran the Zoo''). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.\n\nIn May 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a report on [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin]] (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize. He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book using only those words.<ref name=\"new yorker 1960\">{{cite web |title= Profiles: Children's Friend |last=Kahn, Jr. |first=E.J. |authorlink=Ely Jacques Kahn, Jr. |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1960-12-17#folio=046 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast|Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]] |date=December 17, 1960 |access-date=September 20, 2008 }}</ref> Spaulding challenged Geisel to \"bring back a book children can't put down\".<ref name=\"new yorker 2002\">{{cite web |title=Cat People: What Dr. Seuss Really Taught Us |last=Menand |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Menand |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/12/23/021223crat_atlarge?currentPage=all |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast|Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]] |date=December 23, 2002 |access-date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref> Nine months later, Geisel completed ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'', using 236 of the words given to him.

''The Cat in the Hat'' and subsequent books written for young children achieved significant international success and they remain very popular today. For example, in 2009, ''Green Eggs and Ham'' sold 540,000 copies, ''The Cat in the Hat'' sold 452,000 copies, and ''[[One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish]]'' (1960) sold 409,000 copies \u2014 all outselling the majority of newly published children's books.<ref name=\"Publishers Weekly 2010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/42533-children-s-bestsellers-2009-the-reign-continues.html |title=The Reign Continues |publisher=Publishes Weekly |first=Diane |last=Roback |date=March 22, 2010 |access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGeisel went on to write many other children's books, both in his new simplified-vocabulary manner (sold as [[Beginner Books]]) and in his older, more elaborate style.\n\nIn 1956, Dartmouth awarded Geisel with an honorary doctorate, finally legitimizing the \"Dr.\" in his pen name. \n\nOn April 28, 1958, Geisel appeared on an episode of the panel game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=To Tell the Truth Primetime Episode Guide 1956\u201367|url=http://www.ttttontheweb.com/ttttnighttimeguide.html|website=\"To Tell the Truth\" on the Web|access-date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nGeisel's wife Helen had a long struggle with illnesses.

This is often suggested as one of the reasons that Geisel's writing was so well received.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mensch |first1=Betty |last2=Freeman |first2=Alan |title=Getting to Solla Sollew: The Existentialist Politics of Dr. Seuss |year=1987 |journal=[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] |page=30 |quote=In opposition to the conventional\u2014indeed, hegemonic\u2014iambic voice, his metric triplets offer the power of a more primal chant that quickly draws the reader in with relentless repetition.}}</ref><ref name=\"of-sneetches\">{{cite book |editor-last=Fensch |editor-first=Thomas |title=Of Sneetches and Whos and the Good Dr. Seuss |year=1997 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |isbn=978-0-7864-0388-2 |oclc= 37418407}}</ref>\n\nAnapestic tetrameter consists of four rhythmic units called [[Anapaest|anapests]], each composed of two weak syllables followed by one strong syllable (the beat); often, the first weak syllable is omitted, or an additional weak syllable is added at the end. An example of this meter can be found in Geisel's \"Yertle the Turtle\", from ''[[Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|And to'''day''' the Great '''Yer'''tle, that '''Mar'''velous '''he'''\nIs '''King''' of the '''Mud'''. That is '''all''' he can '''see'''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1958 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=18181636 |pages= }}</ref>}}\n\nSome books by Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also contain many lines written in [[amphibrach|amphibrachic tetrameter]] wherein each strong syllable is surrounded by a weak syllable on each side.  Here is an example  from ''If I Ran the Circus'':\n\n{{poemquote|All '''rea'''dy to '''put''' up the '''tents''' for my '''cir'''cus.\nI '''think''' I will '''call''' it the '''Cir'''cus Mc'''Gur'''kus.}}\n\n{{poemquote|And '''NOW''' comes an '''act''' of E'''nor'''mous E'''nor'''mance!\nNo '''for'''mer per'''for'''mer's per'''formed''' this per'''for'''mance!}}\n\nGeisel also wrote verse in [[trochaic tetrameter]], an arrangement of a strong syllable followed by a weak syllable, with four units per line (for example, the title of ''[[One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish|'''One''' Fish '''Two''' Fish '''Red''' Fish '''Blue''' Fish]]''). Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final [[Weak position (poetry)|weak position]] in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and feminine rhymes.\n\nGeisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for longer stretches typically mixed it with [[iambic tetrameter]], which consists of a weak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to write. Thus, for example, the magicians in ''[[Bartholomew and the Oobleck]]'' make their first appearance chanting in [[trochee]]s (thus resembling the witches of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]''):\n\n{{quote|'''Shuff'''le, '''duff'''le, '''muzz'''le, '''muff'''}}\n\nThey then switch to [[Iamb (poetry)|iambs]] for the oobleck spell:\n\n{{poemquote|Go '''make''' the '''Oob'''leck '''tum'''ble '''down'''\nOn '''ev'''ery '''street''', in '''ev'''ery '''town'''!<ref>{{cite book |title=Bartholomew and the Oobleck |url=https://archive.org/details/bartholomewooble00seus |url-access=registration |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1949 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=391115 |pages= }}</ref>}}\n\n==Artwork==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--first part of section has no references-->\n[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Geisel at work on a drawing of the [[Grinch]] for ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' in 1957]]\n\nGeisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or [[watercolor]]s, but in his children's books of the postwar period, he generally made use of a starker medium\u2014pen and ink\u2014normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as ''[[The Lorax]],'' used more colors.\n\nGeisel's style was unique \u2013 his figures are often \"rounded\" and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of [[The grinch]] and [[the Cat in the Hat]]. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy [[steam calliope]].\n\nGeisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects, and a number of his motifs are identifiable with structures in his childhood home of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], including examples such as the [[onion domes]] of its [[:File:Main_Street_Springfield_Mass_1905.jpg|Main Street]] and his family's brewery.<ref>{{cite web|website=Hell's Acres|archive-date=February 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219015335/http://hellsacres.blogspot.com/2015/01/seussified-springfield.html|url=http://hellsacres.blogspot.com/2015/01/seussified-springfield.html|title=Seussified Springfield|date=January 1, 2015}}\n* {{cite web|website=Springfield Museums|archive-date=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819083645/https://springfieldmuseums.org/press-release/and-to-think-that-he-saw-it-in-springfield/|url=https://springfieldmuseums.org/press-release/and-to-think-that-he-saw-it-in-springfield/|date=August 2, 2011|title=And to Think that He Saw It in Springfield!}}</ref> His endlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the ''Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count'', from ''[[Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book]]'', or the \"most peculiar machine\" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in ''[[The Sneetches]]''. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of ''[[Bartholomew Cubbins]]'', the tail of ''[[Gertrude McFuzz]]'', and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish''.\n\nGeisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of \"voil\u00e0\" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish'' when he creates fish (who perform the gesture with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of ''If I Ran the Circus'', and in the introduction of the \"Little Cats\" in ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.\n\nGeisel also follows the [[cartoon]] tradition of showing [[motion lines|motion with lines]], like in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in ''If I Ran the Circus''. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses\u2014sight, smell, and hearing\u2014in ''The Big Brag,'' and lines even illustrate \"thought\", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.\n\n===Recurring images===\nGeisel's early work in advertising and [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]] helped him to produce \"sketches\" of things that received more perfect realization later in his children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image, later on, was quite different from the original.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mandeville Special Collections Library, UC San Diego|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|publisher=UC San Diego|access-date=April 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512120300/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Here are some examples:\n* An editorial cartoon from July 16, 1941<ref name=isolationist-pic>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Dr. Seuss|story=The Isolationist|title=PM|date=July 16, 1941|accessdate=April 9, 2012|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417213611/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 17, 2012}} </ref> depicts a whale resting on the top of a mountain as a [[parody]] of American [[isolationism|isolationists]], especially [[Charles Lindbergh]].

However, he did permit the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience during World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.\n\nThe first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'', animated at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942 and directed by [[Bob Clampett]]. It was presented as part of the [[Merrie Melodies]] series and included a number of gags not present in the original narrative, including a fish committing suicide and a [[Katharine Hepburn]] imitation by Mayzie.\n\nAs part of [[George Pal]]\u2019s [[Puppetoons]] theatrical cartoon series for [[Paramount Pictures]], two of Geisel's works were adapted into stop-motion films by George Pal. The first, \"[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]\", was released in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035602/ |website=IMDB |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> The second, \"[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street#film|And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]\", with a title slightly altered from [[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street|the book's]], was released in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Cartoon Database |url= https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36555-And-To-Think-I-Saw-It-On-Mulberry-Street |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> Both were nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for \"Short Subject (Cartoon)\"]].\n\nIn 1959, Geisel authorized [[Revell]], the well-known plastic model-making company, to make a series of \"animals\" that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled \"in thousands\" of ways. The series was called the \"Dr. Seuss Zoo\" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a \"Gift Set\" as well as individually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together \"beginner's kit\" of The Cat in the Hat.\n\nIn 1966, Geisel authorized eminent cartoon artist [[Chuck Jones]]&nbsp;\u2013 his friend and former colleague from the war&nbsp;\u2013 to make a cartoon version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' Geisel was credited as a co-producer under his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by [[Boris Karloff]], who also provided the voice of the Grinch. It was very faithful to the original book and is considered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual [[Christmas television special]]. Jones directed an adaptation of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' in 1970 and produced an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' in 1971.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials that were produced by [[DePatie-Freleng]]: ''[[The Lorax (TV special)|The Lorax]]'' (1972); ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'' (1973); ''[[The Hoober-Bloob Highway]]'' (1975); ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (1977); ''[[Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?]]'' (1980); and ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'' (1982). Several of the specials won multiple [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards.\n\nA Soviet [[Paint-on-glass animation|paint-on-glass-animated]] short film was made in 1986 called ''[[Welcome (1986 film)|Welcome]]'', an adaptation of ''Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose''. The last adaptation of Geisel's work before he died was ''[[The Butter Battle Book]]'', a television special based on the book of the same name, directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]].\n\nA television film titled ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'' was released in 1994, which adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions and animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the animated portions were merely edited versions of previous animated television specials and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well.\n\nAfter Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel was placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action feature-film version of ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]], as well as a Seuss-themed [[Broadway theater|Broadway musical]] called ''[[Seussical]]'', and both premiered in 2000. ''The Grinch'' has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas season, after premiering in 1998 (under the title ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'') at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003, another live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' that featured [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as the title character. Audrey Geisel spoke critically of the film, especially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she would not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.<ref>[[Associated Press]] (February 26, 2004).

A second CGI-animated feature film adaptation of ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'' was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] on March 2, 2012 (on what would have been Seuss's 108th birthday). The third adaptation of Seuss' story, the CGI-animated feature film, ''[[The Grinch (film)|The Grinch]]'', was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] on November 9, 2018.\n\nFour television series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first, ''Gerald McBoing-Boing'', was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's 1951 cartoon [[Gerald McBoing-Boing|of the same name]] and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', was a mix of live-action and puppetry by [[Jim Henson Television]], the producers of [[The Muppets]]. It aired for one season on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States, from 1996 to 1997. The third, ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'', is a remake of the 1956 series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/arts/television/02elli.html |title=The Return of&nbsp;...

Then, in 1943, he joined the Army as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] and was commander of the Animation Department of the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], where he wrote films that included ''[[Your Job in Germany]]'', a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; ''[[Our Job in Japan]]''; and the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of adult army training films.

He published most of his books through [[Random House]] in North America and [[William Collins, Sons]] (later [[HarperCollins]]) internationally. He wrote many, including such favorites as ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1955), ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956), ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' (1957), ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1957), and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the [[Caldecott Medal]] nor the [[Newbery Medal]]. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''Bartholomew and the Oobleck'' (1949), and ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950). Dr. Seuss also wrote the [[musical film|musical]] and [[fantasy film]] ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.]]'', which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in ''[[Redbook]]'' Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as ''The Sneetches and Other Stories'') or reworked into independent books (''If I Ran the Zoo''). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.\n\nIn May 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a report on [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin]] (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize.

His cartoons portrayed the fear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and those who threatened to cut the United States' \"life line\"<ref name=LifeLine /> to Stalin and the USSR, whom he once depicted as a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] carrying \"our war load\".<ref name=\"OurWarLoad\" />\n\n[[File:Seuss cartoon.png|thumb|Dr. Seuss 1942 cartoon with the caption 'Waiting for the Signal from Home']]\nGeisel supported the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during World War II.

An example of this meter can be found in Geisel's \"Yertle the Turtle\", from ''[[Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|And to'''day''' the Great '''Yer'''tle, that '''Mar'''velous '''he'''\nIs '''King''' of the '''Mud'''. That is '''all''' he can '''see'''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1958 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=18181636 |pages= }}</ref>}}\n\nSome books by Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also contain many lines written in [[amphibrach|amphibrachic tetrameter]] wherein each strong syllable is surrounded by a weak syllable on each side.  Here is an example  from ''If I Ran the Circus'':\n\n{{poemquote|All '''rea'''dy to '''put''' up the '''tents''' for my '''cir'''cus.\nI '''think''' I will '''call''' it the '''Cir'''cus Mc'''Gur'''kus.}}\n\n{{poemquote|And '''NOW''' comes an '''act''' of E'''nor'''mous E'''nor'''mance!\nNo '''for'''mer per'''for'''mer's per'''formed''' this per'''for'''mance!}}\n\nGeisel also wrote verse in [[trochaic tetrameter]], an arrangement of a strong syllable followed by a weak syllable, with four units per line (for example, the title of ''[[One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish|'''One''' Fish '''Two''' Fish '''Red''' Fish '''Blue''' Fish]]''). Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final [[Weak position (poetry)|weak position]] in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and feminine rhymes.\n\nGeisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for longer stretches typically mixed it with [[iambic tetrameter]], which consists of a weak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to write. Thus, for example, the magicians in ''[[Bartholomew and the Oobleck]]'' make their first appearance chanting in [[trochee]]s (thus resembling the witches of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]''):\n\n{{quote|'''Shuff'''le, '''duff'''le, '''muzz'''le, '''muff'''}}\n\nThey then switch to [[Iamb (poetry)|iambs]] for the oobleck spell:\n\n{{poemquote|Go '''make''' the '''Oob'''leck '''tum'''ble '''down'''\nOn '''ev'''ery '''street''', in '''ev'''ery '''town'''!<ref>{{cite book |title=Bartholomew and the Oobleck |url=https://archive.org/details/bartholomewooble00seus |url-access=registration |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1949 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=391115 |pages= }}</ref>}}\n\n==Artwork==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--first part of section has no references-->\n[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Geisel at work on a drawing of the [[Grinch]] for ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' in 1957]]\n\nGeisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or [[watercolor]]s, but in his children's books of the postwar period, he generally made use of a starker medium\u2014pen and ink\u2014normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as ''[[The Lorax]],'' used more colors.\n\nGeisel's style was unique \u2013 his figures are often \"rounded\" and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of [[The grinch]] and [[the Cat in the Hat]]. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy [[steam calliope]].\n\nGeisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects, and a number of his motifs are identifiable with structures in his childhood home of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], including examples such as the [[onion domes]] of its [[:File:Main_Street_Springfield_Mass_1905.jpg|Main Street]] and his family's brewery.<ref>{{cite web|website=Hell's Acres|archive-date=February 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219015335/http://hellsacres.blogspot.com/2015/01/seussified-springfield.html|url=http://hellsacres.blogspot.com/2015/01/seussified-springfield.html|title=Seussified Springfield|date=January 1, 2015}}\n* {{cite web|website=Springfield Museums|archive-date=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819083645/https://springfieldmuseums.org/press-release/and-to-think-that-he-saw-it-in-springfield/|url=https://springfieldmuseums.org/press-release/and-to-think-that-he-saw-it-in-springfield/|date=August 2, 2011|title=And to Think that He Saw It in Springfield!}}</ref> His endlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the ''Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count'', from ''[[Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book]]'', or the \"most peculiar machine\" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in ''[[The Sneetches]]''. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of ''[[Bartholomew Cubbins]]'', the tail of ''[[Gertrude McFuzz]]'', and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish''.\n\nGeisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of \"voil\u00e0\" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish'' when he creates fish (who perform the gesture with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of ''If I Ran the Circus'', and in the introduction of the \"Little Cats\" in ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.\n\nGeisel also follows the [[cartoon]] tradition of showing [[motion lines|motion with lines]], like in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in ''If I Ran the Circus''. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses\u2014sight, smell, and hearing\u2014in ''The Big Brag,'' and lines even illustrate \"thought\", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.\n\n===Recurring images===\nGeisel's early work in advertising and [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]] helped him to produce \"sketches\" of things that received more perfect realization later in his children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image, later on, was quite different from the original.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mandeville Special Collections Library, UC San Diego|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|publisher=UC San Diego|access-date=April 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512120300/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Here are some examples:\n* An editorial cartoon from July 16, 1941<ref name=isolationist-pic>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Dr. Seuss|story=The Isolationist|title=PM|date=July 16, 1941|accessdate=April 9, 2012|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417213611/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 17, 2012}} </ref> depicts a whale resting on the top of a mountain as a [[parody]] of American [[isolationism|isolationists]], especially [[Charles Lindbergh]].

However, he did permit the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience during World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.\n\nThe first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'', animated at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942 and directed by [[Bob Clampett]]. It was presented as part of the [[Merrie Melodies]] series and included a number of gags not present in the original narrative, including a fish committing suicide and a [[Katharine Hepburn]] imitation by Mayzie.\n\nAs part of [[George Pal]]\u2019s [[Puppetoons]] theatrical cartoon series for [[Paramount Pictures]], two of Geisel's works were adapted into stop-motion films by George Pal. The first, \"[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]\", was released in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035602/ |website=IMDB |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> The second, \"[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street#film|And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]\", with a title slightly altered from [[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street|the book's]], was released in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Cartoon Database |url= https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36555-And-To-Think-I-Saw-It-On-Mulberry-Street |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> Both were nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for \"Short Subject (Cartoon)\"]].\n\nIn 1959, Geisel authorized [[Revell]], the well-known plastic model-making company, to make a series of \"animals\" that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled \"in thousands\" of ways. The series was called the \"Dr. Seuss Zoo\" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a \"Gift Set\" as well as individually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together \"beginner's kit\" of The Cat in the Hat.\n\nIn 1966, Geisel authorized eminent cartoon artist [[Chuck Jones]]&nbsp;\u2013 his friend and former colleague from the war&nbsp;\u2013 to make a cartoon version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' Geisel was credited as a co-producer under his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by [[Boris Karloff]], who also provided the voice of the Grinch. It was very faithful to the original book and is considered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual [[Christmas television special]]. Jones directed an adaptation of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' in 1970 and produced an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' in 1971.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials that were produced by [[DePatie-Freleng]]: ''[[The Lorax (TV special)|The Lorax]]'' (1972); ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'' (1973); ''[[The Hoober-Bloob Highway]]'' (1975); ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (1977); ''[[Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?]]'' (1980); and ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'' (1982). Several of the specials won multiple [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards.\n\nA Soviet [[Paint-on-glass animation|paint-on-glass-animated]] short film was made in 1986 called ''[[Welcome (1986 film)|Welcome]]'', an adaptation of ''Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose''. The last adaptation of Geisel's work before he died was ''[[The Butter Battle Book]]'', a television special based on the book of the same name, directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]].\n\nA television film titled ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'' was released in 1994, which adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions and animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the animated portions were merely edited versions of previous animated television specials and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well.\n\nAfter Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel was placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action feature-film version of ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]], as well as a Seuss-themed [[Broadway theater|Broadway musical]] called ''[[Seussical]]'', and both premiered in 2000. ''The Grinch'' has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas season, after premiering in 1998 (under the title ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'') at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003, another live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' that featured [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as the title character. Audrey Geisel spoke critically of the film, especially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she would not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.<ref>[[Associated Press]] (February 26, 2004).

He then committed suicide. The attack occurred as the officers were executing a search warrant for stolen property and a marijuana-growing operation on the farm. Two individuals who were not present at the shooting, Shawn Hennessey and Dennis Cheeseman, pled guilty to [[Murder_(Canadian_law)#Manslaughter|manslaughter]] for assisting Roszko to return to his farm.\n\nThe incident was the worst one-day loss of life for the RCMP since five officers drowned on June 7, 1958,<ref>{{cite news | title=RCMP's deadliest day | newspaper=Edmonton Journal | date=March 4, 2005}}</ref> and the worst multiple-officer killing in contemporary Canadian history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/4-rcmp-officers-killed-on-alberta-farm-1.521207 | title=4 RCMP officers killed on Alberta farm | newspaper=CBC News | date=March 4, 2005 | accessdate=October 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n=== Initial contact with Roszko ===\nOn the afternoon of March 2, 2005, two [[Bailiff#Canada|civil bailiffs]] went to the farm owned by James Roszko to repossess a truck which Roszko had purchased, but on which he had not made any payments.  They arrived around 3:00{{nbsp}}pm. There was a metal gate blocking the road into the farmyard.  When Roszko saw the bailiffs, he released two large aggressive [[Rottweiler]]s.  The bailiffs decided they should call the RCMP.  The officer who responded to the phone call warned them not to go onto the property until the RCMP arrived.  Roszko had a criminal record with violent and sexual offences, and was subject to a firearms possession prohibition.  He was known to the members of the Mayerthorpe RCMP Detachment.<ref name = Fatality-5>[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf \"Report to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General - Public Fatality Inquiry,\" March 3, 2011, p. 5.]</ref>\n\nRoszko swore at the bailiffs and drove off in a truck.  The bailiffs thought it may have been the truck they were to seize, but were not sure.<ref name = Fatality-2-4>[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf \"Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 2-4.]</ref>\n\nShortly after Roszko drove off, three Mounties arrived, including Constable Peter Schiemann. The bailiffs had the legal authority to search the farm for the truck, since they were not sure if the truck Roszko was using was the truck that they had instructions to seize. Acting under that authority the bailiffs broke open the gate.  The Mounties confined the dogs in a shed.  The group then went to the [[Quonset hut|quonset]] in the farmyard.  They found numerous vehicle parts, indicating a  stolen vehicle [[chop shop]], and a [[marijuana]] [[grow-op]].  The Mounties realised that they would need a search warrant before proceeding any further.  They left the quonset at approximately 4:15{{nbsp}}pm and called in the truck as stolen, warning that other officers should be on the lookout for Roszko.<ref name = Fatality-2-4/>\n\n=== Property search ===\n\nThe senior officer in the group, Corporal James Martin, left to obtain a warrant, leaving two officers to maintain control of the farm.  Corporal Martin returned at 8:40{{nbsp}}pm with the warrant.  Given the expected magnitude of the search, the warrant was valid for twenty-four hours.  The Mounties first conducted a security search of the dwelling and the quonset, to ensure that Roszko was not present.<ref name = Fatality-7-8>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 7-8.]</ref> While their search confirmed Roszko was not on the farm, the RCMP found a radio scanner tuned to the frequency of the [[Whitecourt, Alberta|Whitecourt]] RCMP detachment in Roszko's residence.  They also found lists containing intelligence on the local detachments at Mayerthorpe, Whitecourt,\n[[Barrhead, Alberta|Barrhead]] and [[Evansburg, Alberta|Evansburg]], including members' names, car numbers and cell phone numbers.  There was also a night vision scope and .308 and 9 mm caliber ammunition, which indicated Roszko was in breach of his firearms prohibition.<ref name = Fatality-6>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 6.]</ref>\n\nHaving confirmed that Roszko was not present, the Mounties began the search of the quonset.  The initial focus was on the search and seizure of the marijuana plants and equipment, conducted by a special \"Green Team\" from the RCMP \"K\" Division in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]].  According to documents obtained by the CBC's ''The Fifth Estate'' in a court case to have the search warrants made public, police seized seven growing marijuana plants, and 88 harvested plants from the residence, plus a further 192 growing marijuana plants along with growing equipment from the quonset. The marijuana search concluded around 3:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005.<ref name = Fatality-7-8/>\n\nAll but two Mounties left at that point, with the expectation that an RCMP team which specialised in stolen vehicle searches would arrive in the morning.  Constables Anthony Gordon and Leo Johnston remained on the scene until the morning, with no signs of any trouble.  As a security measure during the night, the Mounties had parked several marked police vehicles prominently in the farmyard with their lights on.  They also left the vehicle doors and man-door of the quonset wide open, with bright halogen lights on inside.  The lights were also left on in the dwelling. The purpose was to make it clear that the Mounties were on the scene and investigating, and to deter unauthorised entry.<ref name = Fatality-7-8/>\n\n=== Roszko's return ===\n\nAfter he fled the farm, Roszko phoned Shawn Hennessey, who worked in Barrhead and who subsequently admitted that he was associated with Roszko in the grow-op.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'', 2009 ABQB 60, para. 14.]</ref>  Roszko wanted to hide his truck on Hennessey's property.  Hennessey refused, but he contacted his brother-in-law, Dennis Cheeseman, for help in dealing with Roszko.  Roszko went to Hennessey's farm. Hennessey and Cheeseman arrived there separately.<ref name = QB-12-15>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 12-15.]</ref>\n\nRoszko was armed with a Beretta hand-gun, and asked for a Winchester rifle that he knew that Hennessey had been given by Hennessey's grandfather.  Hennessey got the rifle, chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, along with ammunition.  He wiped it down.  Cheeseman got a pillow case and some gloves.  He put on the gloves, then put the rifle in the pillowcase and gave it to Roszko.  It was clear to all there that Roszko was enraged at the police.<ref name = QB-15-19>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 15-19.]</ref>  He said he was going to go back to his farm to burn down the quonset, with the evidence of the chop shop and grow op.  He had decided to hide the truck at his aunt's home, and asked Hennessey and Cheeseman to follow him there, then drive him to his own farm.  They agreed to do so.<ref name = QB-15-19/> His aunt's house was 38.5 km from Roszko's own farm.<ref name = QB-11>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 11.]</ref>\n\nAfter parking his truck at his aunt's house, Roszko got into the car driven by Hennessey, who drove him back to the area of Roszko's farm.  On the way, Roszko continued to rant about the RCMP, saying he would get even with them. Cheeseman later said Roszko's ranting was \"devil talk\".<ref name = QB-20-22>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 20-22.]</ref>\n\nRoszko directed them to drive past the road leading to his own farm and go on to the next one. They could see the lights of the police cars at Roszko's farm.  Sometime between 1:00{{nbsp}}am and 3:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005, Hennessey and Cheeseman dropped Roszko off.  He pulled heavy socks over his boots, presumably to hide his tracks in the snow.  He grabbed the Hennessey rifle and set off towards his farm and the police.<ref name = QB-20-22/>\n\nAs they were driving away, Cheeseman suggested to Hennessey that they call police. Hennessey disagreed, and no call was made.<ref name = QB-23>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 23.]</ref>\n\n=== Shooting ===\n\nOn the morning of March 3, 2005, Constables Anthony Gordon and Leo Johnston were still providing scene security, pending the arrival of the RCMP Auto Theft investigators.  In a telephone report at around 9:00{{nbsp}}am, Constable Johnson advised Corporal Martin that the night had been uneventful.  Corporal Martin decided to send Constable Myrol to the scene to assist with the search by the Auto Theft investigators.  Constable Schiemann was not assigned to work at the scene, but agreed to drop off Constable Myrol.  They also agreed that they would pick up some meat and a veterinary sedative to feed and calm down the dogs, who had not been fed since they had been put in the shed the day before. The two drove to the Roszko farm, arriving sometime after 9:30{{nbsp}}am.<ref name = Fatality-8-11>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 8-11.]</ref>\n\nJust before 10:00{{nbsp}}am, Constable Garrett Hoogestraat and Constable Stephen Vigor of the RCMP Auto Theft investigation unit arrived.  They saw the four Mayerthorpe Mounties at the shed, presumably feeding the meat and sedatives to the Rottweilers.  As Hoogestraat and Vigor prepared for the search, the four Mayerthorpe Mounties went towards the quonset.  The doors to the quonset were still open, as they had been all night.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\nUnknown to the Mounties, Roszko was inside the quonset.  The subsequent Fatalities Inquiry could not determine when he had returned, but the judge conducting the inquiry concluded that it was unlikely Roszko had entered the quonset much before daylight.  He was well-dressed to spend the night outdoors. He had probably approached the quonset hiding under a sheet which the Mounties later found in the quonset, along with a pillowcase and workgloves. The sheet would have masked him against the snow, and the socks over his boots would have muffled his steps.<ref name = Fatality-12>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 12.]</ref>\n\nThe four Mayerthorpe Mounties entered the quonset.  Outside the quonset, Constables Hoogestraat and  Vigor heard two loud bangs, followed by several other sounds which they recognized as gunfire.  They also heard screaming from within the quonset.  Constable Hoogestraat ran to the radio to report \"officers down\". Constable Vigor started to the entrance of the quonset, when Roszko came out.  He had a hunting rifle slung on his back, a pistol in his belt and a [[Heckler & Koch G3|Heckler & Koch .308 semi-automatic rifle]] in his hands.  He was just casually walking out, then saw Constable Vigor and stopped, apparently surprised that there were more Mounties outside.  He quickly recovered and fired two shots at Constable Vigor, who took shelter behind a police vehicle and returned fire with two shots from his sidearm.  Both of his shots hit Roszko, who staggered back into the quonset.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\nConstable Hoogestraat was unable to make radio contact with the officers in the shed. The RCMP Emergency Response Team was called by 10:13{{nbsp}}am and arrived by 11:52{{nbsp}}am from Edmonton, which is normally an hour away from Mayerthorpe.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>  An armoured vehicle from the [[Canadian Forces]] [[Edmonton Garrison]] was called in, but subsequently stood down as not needed.<ref name = Fatality-21>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 21.]</ref> The Emergency Response Team sent in a Remote Mobile Investigator, a robot with a video camera attached, and determined that all four officers and Roszko were all dead.<ref name =Fatality-8-11/>\n\nThe Fatalities Inquiry later determined that Roszko killed all four officers, who all died almost instantly.  Only Constable Johnson was able to return fire with one shot.<ref name =Fatality-12/>  Roszko then was wounded in the hand and in the thigh by the shots fired by Constable Vigor outside the quonset.  The shot to his thigh fractured his femur.  After he went back into the quonset, he turned his weapon on himself.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\n== Victims ==\n\nThe police officers killed in the Mayerthorpe tragedy are referred to as \"The Fallen Four\".<ref>[http://www.fallenfour.ca/Society.aspx?q=1 The Fallen Four Memorial Society.]</ref> Constables Johnston, Myrol and Schiemann were based out of the Mayerthorpe RCMP detachment while Constable Gordon was based out of Whitecourt RCMP detachment.\n\n=== Anthony Gordon ===\n\nConstable Anthony Gordon, who was born in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] and raised in [[Red Deer, Alberta]], became a police officer in October 2002.

They spent more than $2-million investigating the tragedy, with over two hundred officers involved in the case between 2005 and 2007.<ref name =G&M>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/2-face-murder-charges-over-mayerthorpe/article18140350/ Joe Friesen, \"2 face murder charges over Mayerthorpe\", ''Globe and Mail'', published July 9, 2007, updated April 25, 2018.]</ref>  At the time charges were laid in 2007, there were still forty Mounties working on it.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/2-albertans-charged-in-2005-ambush-of-mounties-1.645593 \"2 Albertans charged in 2005 ambush of Mounties\", CBC, July 8, 2007.]</ref>\n\nIn particular, the Mounties wanted to find out how Roszko returned to his farm.  His truck was found at his aunt's residence, 38.5 km from his own farm, suggesting he had received some assistance in returning.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 9, 11.]</ref><ref name = Fatality-13-14>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 13-14.]</ref>\n\n=== Search of Roszko's property ===\n\nAs part of the investigation, the RCMP conducted an extensive investigation of the Roszko property after the shootings, including manual searches and also searches by subsurface radar, x-ray, and airborne infrared methods.  A backhoe was also used.  These search techniques disproved local rumours that Roszko had major caches of drugs and weapons, or that there were tunnels which he had used to enter the quonset.<ref name =Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe search found a sheet, a pillowcase containing a pair of workgloves, a small bottle of water and a tin of bearspray in the northeast corner of the quonset.  The Fatalities Inquiry concluded that Roszko had likely concealed himself at that spot for some time, but had actually been in the southeast corner of the quonset when he fired the shots.<ref name =Fatality-12/>  Subsequent DNA analysis found Hennessey's DNA on one of the workgloves.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 10.]</ref>\n\n=== Weapons ===\n\n[[File:Beretta 92 FS.gif|thumb|A Beretta 92 FS, similar to the gun Roszko possessed]]\n\nThe Mounties also found several weapons hidden in various spots in the quonset, including an empty gun bag that was the right size to hold the Heckler & Koch .308 semi-automatic rifle, and an empty Beretta pistol case.  These two cases, along with a .22 rifle and a shotgun in another case, were all hidden on a ledge and under the plywood roof, accessible only by ladder.  The Fatalities Inquiry surmised that the Heckler & Koch rifle had been hidden in this area and retrieved by Roszko after his return, since he did not have it when he was with Hennessey and Cheeseman.  The Fatalities Inquiry also concluded that the initial clearing search and then the Green Team search would have been unlikely to have found these weapons.<ref name =Fatality-13-14/>  The Mounties also found three additional rifles, in a gun case hidden inside a seed-drill in the quonset:  a Husqvarna .308 rifle and two Lee Enfield .303 rifles.  There was also a rudimentary pipe bomb which would not have operated, a homemade silencing device, and various amounts of ammunition.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe Mounties investigated the sources for each of the guns.  The Heckler & Koch semi-automatic had been legally purchased by a person in Mayerthorpe in the early 1980s, who likely sold it to Rozsko.  After changes to firearms laws in 1995, the Heckler & Koch rifle was classified as a prohibited firearm.  The pistol was a [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92 FS]], which was a restricted weapon.  Roszko had purchased it in Utah in 1993 and apparently smuggled it into Canada.  The .22 rifle and shotgun were legally imported into Canada and were not restricted weapons.  The three rifles found hidden in the seed-drill all had been stolen from a location in Barrhead in 1997.  Roszko had never had a firearm registered to him.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe Mounties also investigated the Winchester hunting rifle.  It was registered to Shawn Hennessey's grandfather, John Hennessey.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 11.]</ref><ref name = Fatality-13-14/> When asked how Roszko obtained the rifle, Shawn Hennessey said he had no idea, and that the rifle had been stolen four months before the shooting.<ref name =G&M/>  Hennessey subsequently admitted that he and his mother had alerted his grandfather that Roszko had the rifle.  John Hennessey admitted that he had told his daughter and grandson that they should all \"story\" to the police that the rifle had been stolen from the back of his welding truck.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 27.]</ref>\n\n=== Cell phone records ===\n\nA cell phone was found on Roszko's body.  The police obtained warrants to track his usage of the phone.  They found that he had begun to use the cell phone around the time he left his farm on March 2, 2005, continuing to do so until shortly before 1:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nInvestigation into the cell phone usage showed that he had called his mother, who had called his aunt.  Interviews with his mother and aunt revealed that he had been seeking permission to hide his truck on his aunt's property.<ref name = QB-11/>\n\nThe cell phone records also showed that Roszko phoned Hennessey's place of employment in Barrhead, and then made several calls to a \"bag phone\" which Hennessey had by virtue of his employment.  Roszko also made several calls to Hennessey's residence.<ref name = QB-12-15/>  When information about the cell phone calls became public a year later, in 2006, Hennessey tearfully denied to a reporter for the Globe and Mail that he knew anything about the events, or why Roszko was calling him.<ref name =G&M/>\n\n=== Undercover investigation ===\n\nMedia accounts suggest that the RCMP conducted an extensive undercover investigation in the two years after the shootings,<ref name = OttCit>[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/charged+killing+four+Mounties+plead+guilty+report/1189363/story.html Hanneke Brooymans, \"Men charged in killing of four Mounties to plead guilty: report\",  Canwest News Service/''Ottawa Citizen'', January 17, 2009.]</ref><ref name = CalHer>[https://calgaryherald.com/news/Pair+helped+Mountie+killer+feared+their+lives/1194662/story.html Ryan Cormier, \"Pair who helped Mountie killer feared for their lives\", Canwest News Service/''Calgary Herald'', January 19, 2009.]</ref> but there are not many details on that aspect of the investigation.

He held that a fit sentence for Hennessey was fifteen years imprisonment, while a fit sentence for Cheeseman was twelve years.

The lengthy period between the killings and the inquiry was because the ''Fatality Inquiries Act'' provides that inquiries are to be stayed pending determination of criminal charges in relation to the deaths.<ref>''Fatality Inquiries Act'', RSA 2000 c. F\u20119, s. 47.</ref>\n\nThe inquiry produced a 26-page report, concluding that the deaths of the four officers were homicides and the death of Roszko was a suicide.  The report provides a detailed factual account of the killings, and also made eight recommendations to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future.<ref>[https://open.alberta.ca/publications/fatality-inquiry-2015-march-27 Report to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General:  Public Fatality Inquiry, March 3, 2011.]</ref>\n\n=== Upgrade to RCMP weapons ===\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the Commissioner of the RCMP, [[William J.&nbsp;S.

They arrived around 3:00{{nbsp}}pm. There was a metal gate blocking the road into the farmyard.  When Roszko saw the bailiffs, he released two large aggressive [[Rottweiler]]s.  The bailiffs decided they should call the RCMP.  The officer who responded to the phone call warned them not to go onto the property until the RCMP arrived.  Roszko had a criminal record with violent and sexual offences, and was subject to a firearms possession prohibition.  He was known to the members of the Mayerthorpe RCMP Detachment.<ref name = Fatality-5>[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf \"Report to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General - Public Fatality Inquiry,\" March 3, 2011, p. 5.]</ref>\n\nRoszko swore at the bailiffs and drove off in a truck.

The bailiffs had the legal authority to search the farm for the truck, since they were not sure if the truck Roszko was using was the truck that they had instructions to seize. Acting under that authority the bailiffs broke open the gate.  The Mounties confined the dogs in a shed.  The group then went to the [[Quonset hut|quonset]] in the farmyard.  They found numerous vehicle parts, indicating a  stolen vehicle [[chop shop]], and a [[marijuana]] [[grow-op]].  The Mounties realised that they would need a search warrant before proceeding any further.  They left the quonset at approximately 4:15{{nbsp}}pm and called in the truck as stolen, warning that other officers should be on the lookout for Roszko.<ref name = Fatality-2-4/>\n\n=== Property search ===\n\nThe senior officer in the group, Corporal James Martin, left to obtain a warrant, leaving two officers to maintain control of the farm.  Corporal Martin returned at 8:40{{nbsp}}pm with the warrant.  Given the expected magnitude of the search, the warrant was valid for twenty-four hours.  The Mounties first conducted a security search of the dwelling and the quonset, to ensure that Roszko was not present.<ref name = Fatality-7-8>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 7-8.]</ref> While their search confirmed Roszko was not on the farm, the RCMP found a radio scanner tuned to the frequency of the [[Whitecourt, Alberta|Whitecourt]] RCMP detachment in Roszko's residence.  They also found lists containing intelligence on the local detachments at Mayerthorpe, Whitecourt,\n[[Barrhead, Alberta|Barrhead]] and [[Evansburg, Alberta|Evansburg]], including members' names, car numbers and cell phone numbers.  There was also a night vision scope and .308 and 9 mm caliber ammunition, which indicated Roszko was in breach of his firearms prohibition.<ref name = Fatality-6>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 6.]</ref>\n\nHaving confirmed that Roszko was not present, the Mounties began the search of the quonset.  The initial focus was on the search and seizure of the marijuana plants and equipment, conducted by a special \"Green Team\" from the RCMP \"K\" Division in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]].  According to documents obtained by the CBC's ''The Fifth Estate'' in a court case to have the search warrants made public, police seized seven growing marijuana plants, and 88 harvested plants from the residence, plus a further 192 growing marijuana plants along with growing equipment from the quonset. The marijuana search concluded around 3:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005.<ref name = Fatality-7-8/>\n\nAll but two Mounties left at that point, with the expectation that an RCMP team which specialised in stolen vehicle searches would arrive in the morning.  Constables Anthony Gordon and Leo Johnston remained on the scene until the morning, with no signs of any trouble.  As a security measure during the night, the Mounties had parked several marked police vehicles prominently in the farmyard with their lights on.  They also left the vehicle doors and man-door of the quonset wide open, with bright halogen lights on inside.  The lights were also left on in the dwelling. The purpose was to make it clear that the Mounties were on the scene and investigating, and to deter unauthorised entry.<ref name = Fatality-7-8/>\n\n=== Roszko's return ===\n\nAfter he fled the farm, Roszko phoned Shawn Hennessey, who worked in Barrhead and who subsequently admitted that he was associated with Roszko in the grow-op.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'', 2009 ABQB 60, para. 14.]</ref>  Roszko wanted to hide his truck on Hennessey's property.  Hennessey refused, but he contacted his brother-in-law, Dennis Cheeseman, for help in dealing with Roszko.  Roszko went to Hennessey's farm. Hennessey and Cheeseman arrived there separately.<ref name = QB-12-15>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 12-15.]</ref>\n\nRoszko was armed with a Beretta hand-gun, and asked for a Winchester rifle that he knew that Hennessey had been given by Hennessey's grandfather.  Hennessey got the rifle, chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, along with ammunition.  He wiped it down.  Cheeseman got a pillow case and some gloves.  He put on the gloves, then put the rifle in the pillowcase and gave it to Roszko.  It was clear to all there that Roszko was enraged at the police.<ref name = QB-15-19>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 15-19.]</ref>  He said he was going to go back to his farm to burn down the quonset, with the evidence of the chop shop and grow op.  He had decided to hide the truck at his aunt's home, and asked Hennessey and Cheeseman to follow him there, then drive him to his own farm.  They agreed to do so.<ref name = QB-15-19/> His aunt's house was 38.5 km from Roszko's own farm.<ref name = QB-11>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 11.]</ref>\n\nAfter parking his truck at his aunt's house, Roszko got into the car driven by Hennessey, who drove him back to the area of Roszko's farm.  On the way, Roszko continued to rant about the RCMP, saying he would get even with them. Cheeseman later said Roszko's ranting was \"devil talk\".<ref name = QB-20-22>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 20-22.]</ref>\n\nRoszko directed them to drive past the road leading to his own farm and go on to the next one. They could see the lights of the police cars at Roszko's farm.  Sometime between 1:00{{nbsp}}am and 3:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005, Hennessey and Cheeseman dropped Roszko off.  He pulled heavy socks over his boots, presumably to hide his tracks in the snow.  He grabbed the Hennessey rifle and set off towards his farm and the police.<ref name = QB-20-22/>\n\nAs they were driving away, Cheeseman suggested to Hennessey that they call police. Hennessey disagreed, and no call was made.<ref name = QB-23>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 23.]</ref>\n\n=== Shooting ===\n\nOn the morning of March 3, 2005, Constables Anthony Gordon and Leo Johnston were still providing scene security, pending the arrival of the RCMP Auto Theft investigators.  In a telephone report at around 9:00{{nbsp}}am, Constable Johnson advised Corporal Martin that the night had been uneventful.  Corporal Martin decided to send Constable Myrol to the scene to assist with the search by the Auto Theft investigators.  Constable Schiemann was not assigned to work at the scene, but agreed to drop off Constable Myrol.  They also agreed that they would pick up some meat and a veterinary sedative to feed and calm down the dogs, who had not been fed since they had been put in the shed the day before. The two drove to the Roszko farm, arriving sometime after 9:30{{nbsp}}am.<ref name = Fatality-8-11>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 8-11.]</ref>\n\nJust before 10:00{{nbsp}}am, Constable Garrett Hoogestraat and Constable Stephen Vigor of the RCMP Auto Theft investigation unit arrived.  They saw the four Mayerthorpe Mounties at the shed, presumably feeding the meat and sedatives to the Rottweilers.  As Hoogestraat and Vigor prepared for the search, the four Mayerthorpe Mounties went towards the quonset.  The doors to the quonset were still open, as they had been all night.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\nUnknown to the Mounties, Roszko was inside the quonset.  The subsequent Fatalities Inquiry could not determine when he had returned, but the judge conducting the inquiry concluded that it was unlikely Roszko had entered the quonset much before daylight.  He was well-dressed to spend the night outdoors. He had probably approached the quonset hiding under a sheet which the Mounties later found in the quonset, along with a pillowcase and workgloves. The sheet would have masked him against the snow, and the socks over his boots would have muffled his steps.<ref name = Fatality-12>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 12.]</ref>\n\nThe four Mayerthorpe Mounties entered the quonset.  Outside the quonset, Constables Hoogestraat and  Vigor heard two loud bangs, followed by several other sounds which they recognized as gunfire.  They also heard screaming from within the quonset.  Constable Hoogestraat ran to the radio to report \"officers down\". Constable Vigor started to the entrance of the quonset, when Roszko came out.  He had a hunting rifle slung on his back, a pistol in his belt and a [[Heckler & Koch G3|Heckler & Koch .308 semi-automatic rifle]] in his hands.  He was just casually walking out, then saw Constable Vigor and stopped, apparently surprised that there were more Mounties outside.  He quickly recovered and fired two shots at Constable Vigor, who took shelter behind a police vehicle and returned fire with two shots from his sidearm.  Both of his shots hit Roszko, who staggered back into the quonset.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\nConstable Hoogestraat was unable to make radio contact with the officers in the shed. The RCMP Emergency Response Team was called by 10:13{{nbsp}}am and arrived by 11:52{{nbsp}}am from Edmonton, which is normally an hour away from Mayerthorpe.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>  An armoured vehicle from the [[Canadian Forces]] [[Edmonton Garrison]] was called in, but subsequently stood down as not needed.<ref name = Fatality-21>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", p. 21.]</ref> The Emergency Response Team sent in a Remote Mobile Investigator, a robot with a video camera attached, and determined that all four officers and Roszko were all dead.<ref name =Fatality-8-11/>\n\nThe Fatalities Inquiry later determined that Roszko killed all four officers, who all died almost instantly.  Only Constable Johnson was able to return fire with one shot.<ref name =Fatality-12/>  Roszko then was wounded in the hand and in the thigh by the shots fired by Constable Vigor outside the quonset.  The shot to his thigh fractured his femur.  After he went back into the quonset, he turned his weapon on himself.<ref name = Fatality-8-11/>\n\n== Victims ==\n\nThe police officers killed in the Mayerthorpe tragedy are referred to as \"The Fallen Four\".<ref>[http://www.fallenfour.ca/Society.aspx?q=1 The Fallen Four Memorial Society.]</ref> Constables Johnston, Myrol and Schiemann were based out of the Mayerthorpe RCMP detachment while Constable Gordon was based out of Whitecourt RCMP detachment.\n\n=== Anthony Gordon ===\n\nConstable Anthony Gordon, who was born in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] and raised in [[Red Deer, Alberta]], became a police officer in October 2002. He was stationed in Whitecourt, {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Mayerthorpe, where he was assigned to general policing and highway patrol.

From [[Owl River, Alberta]], he began his career in nearby [[Lac La Biche, Alberta]] before being transferred to Mayerthorpe. Constable Johnston was 32 at the time of his death.

They spent more than $2-million investigating the tragedy, with over two hundred officers involved in the case between 2005 and 2007.<ref name =G&M>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/2-face-murder-charges-over-mayerthorpe/article18140350/ Joe Friesen, \"2 face murder charges over Mayerthorpe\", ''Globe and Mail'', published July 9, 2007, updated April 25, 2018.]</ref>  At the time charges were laid in 2007, there were still forty Mounties working on it.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/2-albertans-charged-in-2005-ambush-of-mounties-1.645593 \"2 Albertans charged in 2005 ambush of Mounties\", CBC, July 8, 2007.]</ref>\n\nIn particular, the Mounties wanted to find out how Roszko returned to his farm.  His truck was found at his aunt's residence, 38.5 km from his own farm, suggesting he had received some assistance in returning.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), paras. 9, 11.]</ref><ref name = Fatality-13-14>\"[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/b1360153-b288-41a3-8637-112e0786d79b/resource/5556b599-6eb2-4ec6-bb79-eb19b7eb3bf8/download/2015-fatality-report-mayerthorpercmp.pdf Public Fatality Inquiry Report\", pp. 13-14.]</ref>\n\n=== Search of Roszko's property ===\n\nAs part of the investigation, the RCMP conducted an extensive investigation of the Roszko property after the shootings, including manual searches and also searches by subsurface radar, x-ray, and airborne infrared methods.  A backhoe was also used.  These search techniques disproved local rumours that Roszko had major caches of drugs and weapons, or that there were tunnels which he had used to enter the quonset.<ref name =Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe search found a sheet, a pillowcase containing a pair of workgloves, a small bottle of water and a tin of bearspray in the northeast corner of the quonset.  The Fatalities Inquiry concluded that Roszko had likely concealed himself at that spot for some time, but had actually been in the southeast corner of the quonset when he fired the shots.<ref name =Fatality-12/>  Subsequent DNA analysis found Hennessey's DNA on one of the workgloves.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 10.]</ref>\n\n=== Weapons ===\n\n[[File:Beretta 92 FS.gif|thumb|A Beretta 92 FS, similar to the gun Roszko possessed]]\n\nThe Mounties also found several weapons hidden in various spots in the quonset, including an empty gun bag that was the right size to hold the Heckler & Koch .308 semi-automatic rifle, and an empty Beretta pistol case.  These two cases, along with a .22 rifle and a shotgun in another case, were all hidden on a ledge and under the plywood roof, accessible only by ladder.  The Fatalities Inquiry surmised that the Heckler & Koch rifle had been hidden in this area and retrieved by Roszko after his return, since he did not have it when he was with Hennessey and Cheeseman.  The Fatalities Inquiry also concluded that the initial clearing search and then the Green Team search would have been unlikely to have found these weapons.<ref name =Fatality-13-14/>  The Mounties also found three additional rifles, in a gun case hidden inside a seed-drill in the quonset:  a Husqvarna .308 rifle and two Lee Enfield .303 rifles.  There was also a rudimentary pipe bomb which would not have operated, a homemade silencing device, and various amounts of ammunition.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe Mounties investigated the sources for each of the guns.  The Heckler & Koch semi-automatic had been legally purchased by a person in Mayerthorpe in the early 1980s, who likely sold it to Rozsko.  After changes to firearms laws in 1995, the Heckler & Koch rifle was classified as a prohibited firearm.  The pistol was a [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92 FS]], which was a restricted weapon.  Roszko had purchased it in Utah in 1993 and apparently smuggled it into Canada.  The .22 rifle and shotgun were legally imported into Canada and were not restricted weapons.  The three rifles found hidden in the seed-drill all had been stolen from a location in Barrhead in 1997.  Roszko had never had a firearm registered to him.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nThe Mounties also investigated the Winchester hunting rifle.  It was registered to Shawn Hennessey's grandfather, John Hennessey.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 11.]</ref><ref name = Fatality-13-14/> When asked how Roszko obtained the rifle, Shawn Hennessey said he had no idea, and that the rifle had been stolen four months before the shooting.<ref name =G&M/>  Hennessey subsequently admitted that he and his mother had alerted his grandfather that Roszko had the rifle.  John Hennessey admitted that he had told his daughter and grandson that they should all \"story\" to the police that the rifle had been stolen from the back of his welding truck.<ref>[https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2009/2009abqb60/2009abqb60.html ''R v Hennessey'' (AB QB), para. 27.]</ref>\n\n=== Cell phone records ===\n\nA cell phone was found on Roszko's body.  The police obtained warrants to track his usage of the phone.  They found that he had begun to use the cell phone around the time he left his farm on March 2, 2005, continuing to do so until shortly before 1:00{{nbsp}}am on March 3, 2005.<ref name = Fatality-13-14/>\n\nInvestigation into the cell phone usage showed that he had called his mother, who had called his aunt.  Interviews with his mother and aunt revealed that he had been seeking permission to hide his truck on his aunt's property.<ref name = QB-11/>\n\nThe cell phone records also showed that Roszko phoned Hennessey's place of employment in Barrhead, and then made several calls to a \"bag phone\" which Hennessey had by virtue of his employment.  Roszko also made several calls to Hennessey's residence.<ref name = QB-12-15/>  When information about the cell phone calls became public a year later, in 2006, Hennessey tearfully denied to a reporter for the Globe and Mail that he knew anything about the events, or why Roszko was calling him.<ref name =G&M/>\n\n=== Undercover investigation ===\n\nMedia accounts suggest that the RCMP conducted an extensive undercover investigation in the two years after the shootings,<ref name = OttCit>[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/charged+killing+four+Mounties+plead+guilty+report/1189363/story.html Hanneke Brooymans, \"Men charged in killing of four Mounties to plead guilty: report\",  Canwest News Service/''Ottawa Citizen'', January 17, 2009.]</ref><ref name = CalHer>[https://calgaryherald.com/news/Pair+helped+Mountie+killer+feared+their+lives/1194662/story.html Ryan Cormier, \"Pair who helped Mountie killer feared for their lives\", Canwest News Service/''Calgary Herald'', January 19, 2009.]</ref> but there are not many details on that aspect of the investigation.

The lengthy period between the killings and the inquiry was because the ''Fatality Inquiries Act'' provides that inquiries are to be stayed pending determination of criminal charges in relation to the deaths.<ref>''Fatality Inquiries Act'', RSA 2000 c. F\u20119, s. 47.</ref>\n\nThe inquiry produced a 26-page report, concluding that the deaths of the four officers were homicides and the death of Roszko was a suicide.  The report provides a detailed factual account of the killings, and also made eight recommendations to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future.<ref>[https://open.alberta.ca/publications/fatality-inquiry-2015-march-27 Report to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General:  Public Fatality Inquiry, March 3, 2011.]</ref>\n\n=== Upgrade to RCMP weapons ===\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the Commissioner of the RCMP, [[William J.&nbsp;S.

He is a [[gorilla]] and [[Mario]]'s friendly rival. A popular character, DK has appeared in many video games, along with his friend [[Diddy Kong]]. Donkey Kong appeared as Mario's first opponent in the game bearing the ape's name, [[Nintendo]]'s popular [[1981 in video gaming|1981]] [[arcade game]], ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. Since then he has starred in his own [[Donkey Kong|series of games]], starting with sequels of the arcade game and, later, [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]'s ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). He remains an important character in the ''Mario'' series, such as the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' games]]. DK debuted at the same time as [[Mario]], and he still appears with the plumber on occasion, appearing as a playable character in the ''Mario Kart'' and [[Super Smash Bros.

The series also introduced [[Diddy Kong]] as DK's sidekick, and [[King K. Rool]], king of the Kremlings, as his nemesis who steals his and Diddy Kong's banana hoard. While retaining the red necktie he's had since the [[Game Boy]] game, ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'', he also donned a distinct physical appearance featuring heavy brows and a peaked lock of hair on top of his head. This would become the standard look for Donkey Kong still used over two decades later. The modern Donkey Kong is portrayed as a powerful yet laid-back ape, who is interested mainly in his banana hoard and his girlfriend, Candy Kong.\n\nThe new Donkey Kong introduced in ''Donkey Kong Country'' was initially characterized as the grandson of the original Donkey Kong,<ref>\"One swift blow was all that was needed to leave him sprawled on the floor, face down! he groggily rolled over to see the familiar wrinkled, white-bearded, grouchy face of his old granddad 'punky Kong' peering down at him.\" \u2013 ''Donkey Kong Country'' instruction manual, pg. 5\u20136</ref> who appears in the game as an elderly ape named [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Cranky Kong|Cranky Kong]],<ref name=\"originalDK\">\"In his heyday, Cranky was the original Donkey Kong who battled Mario in several of his own games.\" \u2013 ''Donkey Kong Country'' instruction manual, pg. 6</ref><ref name=nom018>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0002/01/family1.html |title=\u306a\u304b\u307e\u305f\u3061\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u5927\u7d39\u4ecb\u3000page1 |language=Japanese |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208045552/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0002/01/family1.html |archivedate=February 8, 2016 }}</ref> however ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'' states that the current Donkey Kong was actually meant to be Cranky Kong's son,<ref>\"Well, if it isn't my lazy, good-for-nothing son.\" \u2013 Cranky Kong, to Donkey Kong; ''Donkey Kong 64'' in-game dialogue</ref><ref>\"That darn Donkey has all the luck!

As Jumpman, the player must reach Donkey Kong at the top of each stage, where he is holding the Lady captive. Donkey Kong attempts to hinder the player's progress by throwing barrels, springs, and other objects towards Jumpman. The ape reappeared the following year in the sequel ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', where Donkey Kong is taken captive and locked in a cage by the renamed Mario, while Donkey Kong Junior sets out to rescue him. Donkey Kong resumed his antagonistic role in ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'', this time the character Stanley the Bugman taking Mario's place as the protagonist. Stanley fights Donkey Kong's attempts to invade a greenhouse along with a horde of killer bees.\n\nAfter ''Donkey Kong'', Mario went on to become Nintendo's primary mascot, while Donkey Kong and his son were relegated to supporting roles and cameos. The 1994 [[Game Boy]] version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' marked his re-emergence as a major character. He was redesigned, appearing with a red [[necktie]], which sometimes bears his initials, \"DK\".\n\n===Rare era===\nThe 1994 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] game developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] was the beginning of a series. Despite his name being in the titles of both games, DK is the damsel-in-distress in the sequels ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]'', where he is captured by K. Rool.  In these games, the player controls [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Dixie Kong|Dixie Kong]] and one of her fellow Kongs as they set out to rescue him. The ''Donkey Kong Country'' series also inspired the ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'' series and a [[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|television series]]. In ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', [[King K. Rool]] has driven a mechanical Crocodile Isle in front of DK Island after stealing all of Donkey Kong's bananas and friends.\n\n===Post-Rare era===\nFollowing [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s departure from the series, Nintendo co-produced a trilogy of [[rhythm game]]s with [[Namco]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] known as the ''[[Donkey Konga]]'' series, which were based on Namco's own ''[[Taiko: Drum Master]]'', though only two of the series' games made it to America. ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' was released on March 14, 2005 in North America for the GameCube. It depicted DK as being more violent than his original image and also used the bongo controllers. In October 2007, ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'' was released in North America for the [[Wii]].\n\nOn handheld consoles, Donkey Kong was reunited with his former rival Mario in the 2004 [[Game Boy Advance]] game, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]''. A throwback to the ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' game for the Game Boy, Donkey Kong resumed his antagonist role from his earlier games by taking over the Mario Toy Company, upset over the lack of Mini-Mario toys available for purchase. The game was followed by a 2006 sequel titled ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', where Donkey Kong, who is infatuated with Pauline, kidnaps her and takes her to the roof of the Super Mini-Mario World amusement park when she ignores a Mini Donkey Kong toy in favor of a Mini-Mario. He also once again appeared as the antagonist in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]'' and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!]]''. Aside from those, Donkey Kong appeared in ''[[DK King of Swing]]'' on the GBA around the time of ''Jungle Beat'', and in its sequel, ''[[DK Jungle Climber]]'', for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In the 2010 Wii game, ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'', Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong get rid of the [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Tiki Tak Tribe|Tiki Tak Tribe]], who appears on Donkey Kong Island and hypnotizes various creatures. In the 2014 Wii U game, ''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'', Donkey Kong sets out to get his home back from evil Vikings known as the Snowmads.\n\n===Other appearances===\nEvery ''[[Mario Kart]]'' game has featured a version of Donkey Kong as a playable character. ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' featured [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Donkey Kong Junior|Donkey Kong Junior]] as a playable character. The modern Donkey Kong made his first appearance in the series with ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', and been in every game to date since.\n\nIn the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, he was a playable [[Player character|character]] in all three titles released for the N64, and also ''[[Mario Party 4]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], this one being his last playable appearance in the series for some time. He eventually became an \"event character\" in later games, making appearances as an incidental character on the game board. He made an appearance within ''[[Mario Party 8]]'', once again as an incidental character on the game board. Donkey Kong also appears in ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' and in ''[[Mario Party 9]]'' as a [[non-player character]], though he came back as playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and in ''[[Mario Party: Star Rush]]'' (along with [[Diddy Kong]]). Donkey Kong appears as a contender in ''[[Mario Party: The Top 100]]'', and later as an unlockable, playable character in ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n\nDonkey Kong has also made playable appearance in various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports games]]. Donkey Kong was also a selectable character in ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]'' and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]''. Donkey Kong is playable in ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour]]'' and ''[[Mario Golf: World Tour]]'' but not ''[[Mario Golf: Advance Tour]]''. Donkey Kong featured in ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'' for the GameCube and made his first appearance on the [[Wii]] within the title ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' as a playable [[soccer]] captain. In ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', he appears as a captain again. Donkey Kong also appears in ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]''. He made a playable appearance in almost every [[Mario & Sonic|Mario & Sonic game]], starting with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]].'' He's also playable in ''[[Mario Hoops 3-on-3]]'' and ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]''.\n\nHe is also playable in each ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' game. Donkey Kong appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' as the first character from the ''Donkey Kong'' series and had a stage called \"Kongo Jungle\", which was based on ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''. Both he and Kongo Jungle returned for the series second game, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. In this game, he had two new stages called \"Jungle Japes\" and \"Kongo Jungle\", and a version of the \"DK Rap\" from ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'' serves as stage music for Kongo Jungle (the one difference in the lyrics being the word \"heck\" substituted from the word \"hell\"). He appeared once more in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', this time being joined by his sidekick [[Diddy Kong]] and three stages \u2013 \"Jungle Japes\" from ''Melee'', \"Rumble Falls\" from ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'',<ref name=\"Rumble Falls\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/stages/stage07.html |title=Rumble Falls |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |date=July 23, 2007 |work=Smash Bros.

Both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong returned to the series in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'', with Donkey Kong being among the first wave of [[amiibo]] released for the games. ''Jungle Japes'' from ''Melee'' returns in the 3DS version, and both ''Kongo Jungle'' from the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''75m'' from ''Brawl'' return in the Wii U version, along with a new stage called ''Jungle Hijinxs'' from ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]''. Along with Bowser, he is also a playable guest character in the Nintendo versions of ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]''. ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features Donkey Kong as a ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume. Donkey Kong appears as one of the playable characters in the downloadable campaign, ''Donkey Kong Adventure'', for ''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]''.\n\nThe character has also made more incidental appearances. Two minor enemies in ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' bear a striking resemblance to Donkey Kong. One of the enemies, named \"Guerrilla\", says \"Don't confuse me with someone else,\" referring to DK. Both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Jr. appear as minor antagonists in the ''Super Mario Bros.''-based [[Nintendo Adventure Books|adventure book]] ''Doors to Doom''. Donkey Kong was also featured on the ''[[Game &amp; Watch Gallery]]'' handheld series and ''[[Tetris DS]]''. In ''Yoshi's Island DS'', Donkey Kong appears as \"Baby DK\", a younger version of himself, similar to [[Baby Mario]]. First appearing in World 2\u20131, most of his gameplay reflects ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', even featuring the Snapjaw enemies from the game. He has been seen in the audience of some games in the ''[[Punch-Out!!]]'' series. He also serves as the hidden opponent in 2009's ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'' on the Wii. During Rare's time, references were seen throughout Rare's games. In ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', Bottle's daughter, Goggles, is seen holding a Donkey Kong plush doll. Also in the worker's quarters in Grunty's Industries, the ''DK'' logo is seen on the fridge.\n\nOutside of video games, Donkey Kong has made several appearances in animation. The 1983 animated anthology series ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' featured cartoon segments based on the original ''Donkey Kong'' arcade game. In the segments, Donkey Kong, voiced by [[Soupy Sales]], was an escaped circus gorilla on the run from [[Mario]] and [[Pauline (Mario)|Pauline]], who seek to recapture him. A second series of segments based on ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' focused on the title character, voiced by [[Frank Welker]], who sought to find his missing father after his escape from the circus. Donkey Kong later appeared as a recurring antagonist in the 1989 animated series ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'', voiced by [[Garry Chalk]]. He is depicted as the territorial and easily angered ruler of Kongoland, and must be fed to be appeased. Donkey Kong was also the main character of the 1996 ''[[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|Donkey Kong Country]]'' animated series, in which Donkey Kong fought to protect Kongo Bongo Island and the mystical Crystal Coconut from King K. Rool and his Kremling henchmen. Donkey Kong was voiced by [[Richard Yearwood]], with his singing voice performed by [[Sterling Jarvis]].\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\nDonkey Kong has been described as one of the most iconic mascots for [[Nintendo]].<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-12-greatest-arcade-machines-of-all-time/a-2009062914347329043 The 12 greatest arcade machines of all time | GamesRadar]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=q-Cv6K761nAC Complete Digital Illustration: A ... \u2013 Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In their 250th issue in January 2010, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' ranked him as their eighth-favorite Nintendo hero, stating that while he is a somewhat goofy hero, he is decently good overall and an entertaining one.

Donkey Kong appeared as Mario's first opponent in the game bearing the ape's name, [[Nintendo]]'s popular [[1981 in video gaming|1981]] [[arcade game]], ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. Since then he has starred in his own [[Donkey Kong|series of games]], starting with sequels of the arcade game and, later, [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]'s ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).

While retaining the red necktie he's had since the [[Game Boy]] game, ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'', he also donned a distinct physical appearance featuring heavy brows and a peaked lock of hair on top of his head. This would become the standard look for Donkey Kong still used over two decades later.

As Jumpman, the player must reach Donkey Kong at the top of each stage, where he is holding the Lady captive. Donkey Kong attempts to hinder the player's progress by throwing barrels, springs, and other objects towards Jumpman. The ape reappeared the following year in the sequel ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', where Donkey Kong is taken captive and locked in a cage by the renamed Mario, while Donkey Kong Junior sets out to rescue him. Donkey Kong resumed his antagonistic role in ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'', this time the character Stanley the Bugman taking Mario's place as the protagonist. Stanley fights Donkey Kong's attempts to invade a greenhouse along with a horde of killer bees.\n\nAfter ''Donkey Kong'', Mario went on to become Nintendo's primary mascot, while Donkey Kong and his son were relegated to supporting roles and cameos. The 1994 [[Game Boy]] version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' marked his re-emergence as a major character. He was redesigned, appearing with a red [[necktie]], which sometimes bears his initials, \"DK\".\n\n===Rare era===\nThe 1994 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] game developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] was the beginning of a series. Despite his name being in the titles of both games, DK is the damsel-in-distress in the sequels ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]'', where he is captured by K. Rool.  In these games, the player controls [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Dixie Kong|Dixie Kong]] and one of her fellow Kongs as they set out to rescue him. The ''Donkey Kong Country'' series also inspired the ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'' series and a [[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|television series]]. In ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', [[King K. Rool]] has driven a mechanical Crocodile Isle in front of DK Island after stealing all of Donkey Kong's bananas and friends.\n\n===Post-Rare era===\nFollowing [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s departure from the series, Nintendo co-produced a trilogy of [[rhythm game]]s with [[Namco]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] known as the ''[[Donkey Konga]]'' series, which were based on Namco's own ''[[Taiko: Drum Master]]'', though only two of the series' games made it to America. ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' was released on March 14, 2005 in North America for the GameCube. It depicted DK as being more violent than his original image and also used the bongo controllers. In October 2007, ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'' was released in North America for the [[Wii]].\n\nOn handheld consoles, Donkey Kong was reunited with his former rival Mario in the 2004 [[Game Boy Advance]] game, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]''. A throwback to the ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' game for the Game Boy, Donkey Kong resumed his antagonist role from his earlier games by taking over the Mario Toy Company, upset over the lack of Mini-Mario toys available for purchase. The game was followed by a 2006 sequel titled ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', where Donkey Kong, who is infatuated with Pauline, kidnaps her and takes her to the roof of the Super Mini-Mario World amusement park when she ignores a Mini Donkey Kong toy in favor of a Mini-Mario. He also once again appeared as the antagonist in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]'' and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!]]''. Aside from those, Donkey Kong appeared in ''[[DK King of Swing]]'' on the GBA around the time of ''Jungle Beat'', and in its sequel, ''[[DK Jungle Climber]]'', for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In the 2010 Wii game, ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'', Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong get rid of the [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Tiki Tak Tribe|Tiki Tak Tribe]], who appears on Donkey Kong Island and hypnotizes various creatures. In the 2014 Wii U game, ''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'', Donkey Kong sets out to get his home back from evil Vikings known as the Snowmads.\n\n===Other appearances===\nEvery ''[[Mario Kart]]'' game has featured a version of Donkey Kong as a playable character. ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' featured [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Donkey Kong Junior|Donkey Kong Junior]] as a playable character. The modern Donkey Kong made his first appearance in the series with ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', and been in every game to date since.\n\nIn the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, he was a playable [[Player character|character]] in all three titles released for the N64, and also ''[[Mario Party 4]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], this one being his last playable appearance in the series for some time. He eventually became an \"event character\" in later games, making appearances as an incidental character on the game board. He made an appearance within ''[[Mario Party 8]]'', once again as an incidental character on the game board. Donkey Kong also appears in ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' and in ''[[Mario Party 9]]'' as a [[non-player character]], though he came back as playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and in ''[[Mario Party: Star Rush]]'' (along with [[Diddy Kong]]). Donkey Kong appears as a contender in ''[[Mario Party: The Top 100]]'', and later as an unlockable, playable character in ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n\nDonkey Kong has also made playable appearance in various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports games]]. Donkey Kong was also a selectable character in ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]'' and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]''. Donkey Kong is playable in ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour]]'' and ''[[Mario Golf: World Tour]]'' but not ''[[Mario Golf: Advance Tour]]''. Donkey Kong featured in ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'' for the GameCube and made his first appearance on the [[Wii]] within the title ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' as a playable [[soccer]] captain. In ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', he appears as a captain again. Donkey Kong also appears in ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]''. He made a playable appearance in almost every [[Mario & Sonic|Mario & Sonic game]], starting with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]].'' He's also playable in ''[[Mario Hoops 3-on-3]]'' and ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]''.\n\nHe is also playable in each ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' game. Donkey Kong appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' as the first character from the ''Donkey Kong'' series and had a stage called \"Kongo Jungle\", which was based on ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''. Both he and Kongo Jungle returned for the series second game, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. In this game, he had two new stages called \"Jungle Japes\" and \"Kongo Jungle\", and a version of the \"DK Rap\" from ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'' serves as stage music for Kongo Jungle (the one difference in the lyrics being the word \"heck\" substituted from the word \"hell\"). He appeared once more in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', this time being joined by his sidekick [[Diddy Kong]] and three stages \u2013 \"Jungle Japes\" from ''Melee'', \"Rumble Falls\" from ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'',<ref name=\"Rumble Falls\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/stages/stage07.html |title=Rumble Falls |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |date=July 23, 2007 |work=Smash Bros.

Both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong returned to the series in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'', with Donkey Kong being among the first wave of [[amiibo]] released for the games. ''Jungle Japes'' from ''Melee'' returns in the 3DS version, and both ''Kongo Jungle'' from the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''75m'' from ''Brawl'' return in the Wii U version, along with a new stage called ''Jungle Hijinxs'' from ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]''. Along with Bowser, he is also a playable guest character in the Nintendo versions of ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]''. ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features Donkey Kong as a ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume. Donkey Kong appears as one of the playable characters in the downloadable campaign, ''Donkey Kong Adventure'', for ''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]''.\n\nThe character has also made more incidental appearances. Two minor enemies in ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' bear a striking resemblance to Donkey Kong. One of the enemies, named \"Guerrilla\", says \"Don't confuse me with someone else,\" referring to DK. Both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Jr. appear as minor antagonists in the ''Super Mario Bros.''-based [[Nintendo Adventure Books|adventure book]] ''Doors to Doom''. Donkey Kong was also featured on the ''[[Game &amp; Watch Gallery]]'' handheld series and ''[[Tetris DS]]''. In ''Yoshi's Island DS'', Donkey Kong appears as \"Baby DK\", a younger version of himself, similar to [[Baby Mario]]. First appearing in World 2\u20131, most of his gameplay reflects ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', even featuring the Snapjaw enemies from the game. He has been seen in the audience of some games in the ''[[Punch-Out!!]]'' series. He also serves as the hidden opponent in 2009's ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'' on the Wii. During Rare's time, references were seen throughout Rare's games. In ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', Bottle's daughter, Goggles, is seen holding a Donkey Kong plush doll. Also in the worker's quarters in Grunty's Industries, the ''DK'' logo is seen on the fridge.\n\nOutside of video games, Donkey Kong has made several appearances in animation. The 1983 animated anthology series ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' featured cartoon segments based on the original ''Donkey Kong'' arcade game. In the segments, Donkey Kong, voiced by [[Soupy Sales]], was an escaped circus gorilla on the run from [[Mario]] and [[Pauline (Mario)|Pauline]], who seek to recapture him. A second series of segments based on ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' focused on the title character, voiced by [[Frank Welker]], who sought to find his missing father after his escape from the circus. Donkey Kong later appeared as a recurring antagonist in the 1989 animated series ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'', voiced by [[Garry Chalk]]. He is depicted as the territorial and easily angered ruler of Kongoland, and must be fed to be appeased. Donkey Kong was also the main character of the 1996 ''[[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|Donkey Kong Country]]'' animated series, in which Donkey Kong fought to protect Kongo Bongo Island and the mystical Crystal Coconut from King K. Rool and his Kremling henchmen. Donkey Kong was voiced by [[Richard Yearwood]], with his singing voice performed by [[Sterling Jarvis]].\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\nDonkey Kong has been described as one of the most iconic mascots for [[Nintendo]].<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-12-greatest-arcade-machines-of-all-time/a-2009062914347329043 The 12 greatest arcade machines of all time | GamesRadar]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=q-Cv6K761nAC Complete Digital Illustration: A ... \u2013 Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In their 250th issue in January 2010, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' ranked him as their eighth-favorite Nintendo hero, stating that while he is a somewhat goofy hero, he is decently good overall and an entertaining one.

An alternative etymology suggested by Prof. Pischel derives ''Rudra'' as the \u201cred one\u201d, the \u201cbrilliant one\u201d from a lost root ''rud-'', \u201cred\u201d<ref name=\"Griffith, p. 75, note 1\">Griffith (1973), p. 75, note 1.</ref> or \u201cruddy\u201d, or alternatively (according to Grassman) \u201cshining\u201d.<ref name=\"Chakravarti, p. 4\"/>\n\nStella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means \u201cwild\u201d, i.e. of ''rude'' (untamed) nature, and translates the name ''Rudra'' as \u201cthe wild one\u201d or \u201cthe fierce god\u201d.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 5. cites M.

This litany was recited during the ''[[Agnicayana]]'' ritual (\"the piling of Agni\"), and it later became a standard element in Rudra liturgy.\n\nA selection of these stanzas, augmented with others, is included in the ''Paippal\u0101da-Sa\u1e43hit\u0101'' of the [[Atharvaveda]] (PS 14.3\u20144).

The Shri Rudram hymn is unique in that it shows the presence of divinity throughout the entire universe. We cannot confine the qualities of the divine to those that are favorable to us.

Rudra comes from 'Ru' meaning '\"Roar or Howl\" (the words 'dreaded' or 'fearsome' could only be used as adjectives to Rudra and not as Rudra, because Rudra is the personification of terror); 'dra' is a superlative meaning 'the most'. So Rudra, depending on the poetic situation, can be meant as 'the most severe roarer/howler' - could be a hurricane or tempest - or 'the most frightening one'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.org/sri-rudram/instructions-to-user.htm|title=Sri Sathya Sai Books & Publication Trust|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=Rudra&lang=sans&action=Search |title = Sanskrit Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==Rudralenka and Shiva==\n\n[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD]]\n[[Shiva]] as we know him today shares many features with Rudra,<ref name=\"Michaels, p. 316\">Michaels, p. 316.</ref> and Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]].

An alternative etymology suggested by Prof. Pischel derives ''Rudra'' as the \u201cred one\u201d, the \u201cbrilliant one\u201d from a lost root ''rud-'', \u201cred\u201d<ref name=\"Griffith, p. 75, note 1\">Griffith (1973), p. 75, note 1.</ref> or \u201cruddy\u201d, or alternatively (according to Grassman) \u201cshining\u201d.<ref name=\"Chakravarti, p. 4\"/>\n\nStella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means \u201cwild\u201d, i.e. of ''rude'' (untamed) nature, and translates the name ''Rudra'' as \u201cthe wild one\u201d or \u201cthe fierce god\u201d.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 5. cites M.

This selection, with further PS additions at the end, circulated more widely as the ''N\u012blarudram'' (or ''N\u012blarudra Upani\u1e63ad'').<ref name=\"Kramrisch pp. 71-74\"/><ref>See Lubin 2007</ref>\n\n===Sri Rudram===\n\nThe President of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], at [[Chennai]], in commentating on the foreword to [[Swami Amritananda]]'s translation of ''Sri Rudram and Purushasuktam'', stated that \"Rudra to whom these prayers are addressed is not a sectarian deity, but the [[Supreme Being]] who is omnipresent and manifests Himself in a myriad forms for the sake of the diverse spiritual aspirants.\" Sri Rudram occurs in the fourth Kanda of the Taittirya Samhita in the Yajur Veda.\nIt is a preeminent Vedic hymn to Lord [[Shiva]] as the God of dissolution, chanted daily in Shiva temples throughout India.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4hLtzCeVds|title=SHRI RUDRAM FROM YAJURVEDA (Full)|last=Karthik Satchitanandam|date=9 July 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe prayer depicts the diverse aspects of the Almighty. The Shri Rudram hymn is unique in that it shows the presence of divinity throughout the entire universe. We cannot confine the qualities of the divine to those that are favorable to us. The Lord is both garden and graveyard, the slayer and the most benevolent one. The Almighty is impartial and ubiquitous.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjBQJqi0Ak|title=Sri Rudram|last=Vasudev R|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn it Rudra is described as the most dreaded terroriser (frightening).Sri Rudram describes Rudra the vedic deity as the personification of 'terror'. Rudra comes from 'Ru' meaning '\"Roar or Howl\" (the words 'dreaded' or 'fearsome' could only be used as adjectives to Rudra and not as Rudra, because Rudra is the personification of terror); 'dra' is a superlative meaning 'the most'. So Rudra, depending on the poetic situation, can be meant as 'the most severe roarer/howler' - could be a hurricane or tempest - or 'the most frightening one'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.org/sri-rudram/instructions-to-user.htm|title=Sri Sathya Sai Books & Publication Trust|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=Rudra&lang=sans&action=Search |title = Sanskrit Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==Rudralenka and Shiva==\n\n[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD]]\n[[Shiva]] as we know him today shares many features with Rudra,<ref name=\"Michaels, p. 316\">Michaels, p. 316.</ref> and Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]].
