There are typically three elements that comprise a \u22121 frameshift signal: a [[slippery sequence]], a spacer region, and an [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|RNA secondary structure.]] The slippery sequence fits a X_XXY_YYZ motif, where XXX is any three identical nucleotides (though some exceptions occur), YYY typically represents UUU or AAA, and Z is A, C or U. Because the structure of this motif contains 2 adjacent 3-nucleotide repeats it is believed that \u22121 frameshifting is described by a tandem slippage model, in which the ribosomal P-site tRNA anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX and the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY simultaneously. These new pairings are identical to the 0-frame pairings except at their third positions. This difference does not significantly disfavor anticodon binding because the third nucleotide in a codon, known as the [[Wobble base pair|wobble position]], has weaker tRNA anticodon binding specificity than the first and second nucleotides.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = Codon\u2014anticodon pairing: the wobble hypothesis | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 548\u2013555 | date = August 1966 | pmid = 5969078 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(66)80022-0 }}</ref> In this model, the motif structure is explained by the fact that the first and second positions of the anticodons must be able to pair perfectly in both the 0 and \u22121 frames.

A \u22121 frameshift in the slippery sequence region results in translation of the ''pol'' instead of the ''gag'' protein-coding region, or open reading frame (ORF).

In programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, the slippery sequence fits a X_XXY_YYZ motif, where XXX is any three identical nucleotides (though some exceptions occur), YYY typically represents UUU or AAA, and Z is A, C or U. In the case of +1 frameshifting, the slippery sequence contains codons for which the corresponding tRNA is more rare, and the frameshift is favored because the codon in the new frame has a more common associated tRNA.<ref name=\":5\" /> One example of a slippery sequence is the [[Polyadenylation|polyA]] on mRNA, which is known to induce ribosome slippage even in the absence of any other elements.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arthur L, Pavlovic-Djuranovic S, Smith-Koutmou K, Green R, Szczesny P, Djuranovic S | title = Translational control by lysine-encoding A-rich sequences | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = e1500154 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26322332 | pmc = 4552401 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500154 | bibcode = 2015SciA....1E0154A }}</ref>\n\n==== RNA secondary structure ====\nEfficient ribosomal frameshifting generally requires the presence of an RNA secondary structure to enhance the effects of the slippery sequence.<ref name=\":0\" /> The RNA structure (which can be a [[stem-loop]] or [[pseudoknot]]) is thought to pause the ribosome on the slippery site during translation, forcing it to relocate and continue replication from the \u22121 position.

The majority of the structures shown are stem-loops, with the exception of the ALIL (apical loop-internal loop) pseudoknot structure. In these images, the larger and incomplete circles of mRNA represent linear regions. The secondary \"stem-loop\" structures, where \"stems\" are formed by a region of mRNA base pairing with another region on the same strand, are shown protruding from the linear DNA. The linear region of the HIV Ribosomal frameshift signal contains a highly conserved UUU UUU A slippery sequence; many of the other predicted structures contain candidates for slippery sequences as well.\n\nThe mRNA sequences in the images can be read according to a set of guidelines.

A \u22121 frameshift signal consists of both elements separated by a spacer region typically 5\u20139 nucleotides long.<ref name=\":02\" /> Frameshifting may also be induced by other molecules which interact with the ribosome or the mRNA (trans-acting).\n\n=== Frameshift signal elements ===\n[[File:RNA_structure.001.jpg|thumb|This is a graphical representation of the HIV1 frameshift signal. A \u22121 frameshift in the slippery sequence region results in translation of the ''pol'' instead of the ''gag'' protein-coding region, or open reading frame (ORF).

In programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, the slippery sequence fits a X_XXY_YYZ motif, where XXX is any three identical nucleotides (though some exceptions occur), YYY typically represents UUU or AAA, and Z is A, C or U. In the case of +1 frameshifting, the slippery sequence contains codons for which the corresponding tRNA is more rare, and the frameshift is favored because the codon in the new frame has a more common associated tRNA.<ref name=\":5\" /> One example of a slippery sequence is the [[Polyadenylation|polyA]] on mRNA, which is known to induce ribosome slippage even in the absence of any other elements.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arthur L, Pavlovic-Djuranovic S, Smith-Koutmou K, Green R, Szczesny P, Djuranovic S | title = Translational control by lysine-encoding A-rich sequences | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = e1500154 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26322332 | pmc = 4552401 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500154 | bibcode = 2015SciA....1E0154A }}</ref>\n\n==== RNA secondary structure ====\nEfficient ribosomal frameshifting generally requires the presence of an RNA secondary structure to enhance the effects of the slippery sequence.<ref name=\":0\" /> The RNA structure (which can be a [[stem-loop]] or [[pseudoknot]]) is thought to pause the ribosome on the slippery site during translation, forcing it to relocate and continue replication from the \u22121 position. It is believed that this occurs because the structure physically blocks movement of the ribosome by becoming stuck in the ribosome mRNA tunnel.<ref name=\":02\" /> This model is supported by the fact that strength of the pseudoknot has been positively correlated with the level of frameshifting for associated mRNA.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen TM, Reihani SN, Oddershede LB, S\u00f8rensen MA | title = Correlation between mechanical strength of messenger RNA pseudoknots and ribosomal frameshifting | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 14 | pages = 5830\u20135835 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17389398 | pmc = 1838403 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608668104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5830H }}</ref>\n\nBelow are examples of predicted secondary structures for frameshift elements shown to stimulate frameshifting in a variety of organisms. The majority of the structures shown are stem-loops, with the exception of the ALIL (apical loop-internal loop) pseudoknot structure. In these images, the larger and incomplete circles of mRNA represent linear regions. The secondary \"stem-loop\" structures, where \"stems\" are formed by a region of mRNA base pairing with another region on the same strand, are shown protruding from the linear DNA. The linear region of the HIV Ribosomal frameshift signal contains a highly conserved UUU UUU A slippery sequence; many of the other predicted structures contain candidates for slippery sequences as well.\n\nThe mRNA sequences in the images can be read according to a set of guidelines.

Burke's early 1960s songs, including \"[[Cry to Me]]\", \"[[Just Out of Reach]]\" and \"Down in the Valley\" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: <blockquote>\"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's \"Just Out Of Reach\". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke \u2014 primarily in a pop vein.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals.

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Hypersoul ===\nHyper soul is a medley of soul and dance music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180 |title=What is Hypersoul?

It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.\n\n=== Nu-jazz and soul-influenced electronica ===\n{{further|Nu jazz|Electronica}}\nMany artists in various genres of [[electronic music]] (such as [[House music|house]], [[drum n bass]], [[UK garage]], and [[downtempo]]) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Non-black Americans in soul music ===\n{{further|Non-black Americans in soul music}}\nThe impact of soul music was manifold; both domestic non-black and international artists were influenced by soul music. [[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are an example of later developments influenced by soul music. \n\nSeveral terms were introduced, such as \"blue-eyed soul\", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name=\"pc52\">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Valli]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nAnother term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"ALLmu\">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].

Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name=\"Mojapelo2008\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1\u2013 |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is \"music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first=Julia |last=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |ISBN=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary.

It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.\n\n=== Nu-jazz and soul-influenced electronica ===\n{{further|Nu jazz|Electronica}}\nMany artists in various genres of [[electronic music]] (such as [[House music|house]], [[drum n bass]], [[UK garage]], and [[downtempo]]) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Non-black Americans in soul music ===\n{{further|Non-black Americans in soul music}}\nThe impact of soul music was manifold; both domestic non-black and international artists were influenced by soul music. [[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are an example of later developments influenced by soul music. \n\nSeveral terms were introduced, such as \"blue-eyed soul\", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name=\"pc52\">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit. [Part 8] |show=52}}</ref> The Righteous Brothers, The Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, [[Steve Winwood]], Van Morrison & Them and [[The Grass Roots]] were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Vali]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nAnother term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"ALLmu\">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].

Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the [[funk]]-influenced Philadelphia soul, or [[Philly soul|\"Philly\" soul]]. The West Coast [[Chicano rock|Latin rock]] scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]] (\"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\") and [[Thee Midniters]] played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious [[rock and roll]] edge. Many of these artists drew from the [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]] scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were \"some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s.\"<ref name=ALLmu/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States|R&B and Soul Music}}\n* [[List of soul musicians]]\n* [[Funk]]\n* [[Disco]]\n* [[Music of the United States]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Adams, Michael (2008).
