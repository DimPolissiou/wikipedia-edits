The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained. In the cities of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;31 is completely city-owned.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_niagara.csv |title=Niagara County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-monroe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Another city-maintained section exists in the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]] from Washburn Street (five blocks east of [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]]) to the eastern city line.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\" /> Two villages\u2014[[Medina, New York|Medina]] and [[Newark, New York|Newark]]\u2014also maintain parts of NY&nbsp;31.

The busiest of these, from [[Interstate&nbsp;590]] (I-590) to [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] in the eastern suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]], carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|per day on average]]. Two other segments\u2014between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY&nbsp;65 to French Road in Brighton and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]\u2014have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY&nbsp;31 in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] town of [[Vernon (town), New York|Vernon]] between the [[Vernon Downs]] racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.<ref name=\"2009tvr\" />\n\n===Western New York===\nNY&nbsp;31 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in northern Niagara Falls. After a short distance eastward through the northern fringe of the city as College Avenue, the road encounters [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]] at the northeastern city line. NY&nbsp;31 continues northeastward into the town of [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], following Witmer Road to an interchange with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] at exit&nbsp;24. Past I-190, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] south of the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] reservoir. At the intersection, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Saunders Settlement Road, a name it retains for almost {{convert|15|mi|0}}. Continuing through [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], NY&nbsp;31 passes the south end of the [[Tuscarora Indian Reservation]] ahead of a brief [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. Past the east end of the concurrency, NY&nbsp;429 travels north toward NY&nbsp;104 while NY&nbsp;31 continues east past [[Niagara County Community College]] to an intersection with [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]], the final state route that NY&nbsp;31 intersects before entering the [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] area.<ref name=\"ilnymap\">{{cite map |title=I Love New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |cartography=[[Map Works]] |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"bing1\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2sYrt88 |title=overview map of NY 31 from Niagara Falls to Gates |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:NY 63-31 in Medina.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;63 north through Medina village]]\nWest of Lockport, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 270|NY&nbsp;270]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY&nbsp;93]]. Continuing into the city, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]] (Transit Street) at an intersection partially located over the [[Erie Canal]]. NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]]. Midway between Albion and [[Holley, New York|Holley]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects the southern end of [[New York State Route 387|NY&nbsp;387]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues to the southeast, entering Holley and intersecting [[New York State Route 237|NY&nbsp;237]] in the village center. The route quickly leaves Holley soon after, crossing into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] just over a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) from the village line.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n===Rochester area===\n====Western suburbs and downtown====\n[[File:NY 31 at NY 31A in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Approaching NY&nbsp;31A on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in Sweden]]\nJust inside the Monroe County line, the road traverses the [[Erie Canal]] before intersecting Redman Road about {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]]. NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]]. The route heads past residential neighborhoods to the north and mostly undeveloped land to the south as it enters the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Elmgrove, built up around NY&nbsp;31's junction with [[New York State Route 386|NY&nbsp;386]].<ref name=\"bing1\" /> Not far to the east, NY&nbsp;31 enters [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]], a densely populated residential community near the northern town line of Gates.

It heads onward toward a pair of overpasses, one carrying I-490 and another holding the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[Rochester Subdivision]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard. It turns east here, following Woodbury Boulevard for two blocks to Chestnut Street, at which point NY&nbsp;31 turns southward to follow Chestnut Street. Westbound NY&nbsp;31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], Chestnut Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY&nbsp;31 retains to [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]].<ref name=\"rochester east quad\">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=o18 |title=Rochester East Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1997 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> Over this stretch, NY&nbsp;31 maintains a constant southeasterly progression as it passes through southeastern Rochester and the town of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]].

From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south.

Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County.

In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time. The route continues southeast into the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]] and the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of the same name]] within, where NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route&nbsp;30 mostly became part of an extended Route&nbsp;20, which now began in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] and followed modern NY&nbsp;425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]] to Medina, however, Route&nbsp;20 was routed on modern NY&nbsp;31 instead.

From [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]] to Jordan, NY&nbsp;31 used a slightly different routing.

York (state)|New York]] in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained. In the cities of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;31 is completely city-owned.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_niagara.csv |title=Niagara County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-monroe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Another city-maintained section exists in the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]] from Washburn Street (five blocks east of [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]]) to the eastern city line.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\" /> Two villages\u2014[[Medina, New York|Medina]] and [[Newark, New York|Newark]]\u2014also maintain parts of NY&nbsp;31.

The busiest of these, from [[Interstate&nbsp;590]] (I-590) to [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] in the eastern suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]], carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|per day on average]]. Two other segments\u2014between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY&nbsp;65 to French Road in Brighton and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]\u2014have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY&nbsp;31 in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] town of [[Vernon (town), New York|Vernon]] between the [[Vernon Downs]] racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.<ref name=\"2009tvr\" />\n\n===Western New York===\nNY&nbsp;31 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in northern Niagara Falls. After a short distance eastward through the northern fringe of the city as College Avenue, the road encounters [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]] at the northeastern city line. NY&nbsp;31 continues northeastward into the town of [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], following Witmer Road to an interchange with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] at exit&nbsp;24. Past I-190, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] south of the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] reservoir. At the intersection, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Saunders Settlement Road, a name it retains for almost {{convert|15|mi|0}}. Continuing through [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], NY&nbsp;31 passes the south end of the [[Tuscarora Indian Reservation]] ahead of a brief [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. Past the east end of the concurrency, NY&nbsp;429 travels north toward NY&nbsp;104 while NY&nbsp;31 continues east past [[Niagara County Community College]] to an intersection with [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]], the final state route that NY&nbsp;31 intersects before entering the [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] area.<ref name=\"ilnymap\">{{cite map |title=I Love New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |cartography=[[Map Works]] |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"bing1\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2sYrt88 |title=overview map of NY 31 from Niagara Falls to Gates |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:NY 63-31 in Medina.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;63 north through Medina village]]\nWest of Lockport, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 270|NY&nbsp;270]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY&nbsp;93]]. Continuing into the city, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]] (Transit Street) at an intersection partially located over the [[Erie Canal]]. NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]]. Midway between Albion and [[Holley, New York|Holley]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects the southern end of [[New York State Route 387|NY&nbsp;387]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues to the southeast, entering Holley and intersecting [[New York State Route 237|NY&nbsp;237]] in the village center. The route quickly leaves Holley soon after, crossing into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] just over a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) from the village line.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n===Rochester area===\n====Western suburbs and downtown====\n[[File:NY 31 at NY 31A in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Approaching NY&nbsp;31A on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in Sweden]]\nJust inside the Monroe County line, the road traverses the [[Erie Canal]] before intersecting Redman Road about {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]]. NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]]. The route heads past residential neighborhoods to the north and mostly undeveloped land to the south as it enters the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Elmgrove, built up around NY&nbsp;31's junction with [[New York State Route 386|NY&nbsp;386]].<ref name=\"bing1\" /> Not far to the east, NY&nbsp;31 enters [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]], a densely populated residential community near the northern town line of Gates. In the southeastern outskirts of the community, NY&nbsp;31 intersects Lyell and Howard Roads at a junction that once served as the western terminus of [[New York State Route 47|NY&nbsp;47]]<ref name=\"bing1\" /><ref name=\"1964map\">{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=[[Sinclair Oil Corporation]] |year=1964 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> NY&nbsp;31 continues east from here as Lyell Avenue, meeting [[New York State Route 390|NY&nbsp;390]] at an interchange immediately north of the route's larger interchange with [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]. Not far to the east is the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line, which NY&nbsp;31 crosses upon traversing the Erie Canal once again.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n[[File:PAETEC Park Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|Broad Street at Sahlen's Stadium]]\nNY&nbsp;31 follows Lyell Avenue through the city to West Broad Street, where it turns to follow Broad Street southeastward past [[Marina Auto Stadium]]. It heads onward toward a pair of overpasses, one carrying I-490 and another holding the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[Rochester Subdivision]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard. It turns east here, following Woodbury Boulevard for two blocks to Chestnut Street, at which point NY&nbsp;31 turns southward to follow Chestnut Street. Westbound NY&nbsp;31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], Chestnut Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY&nbsp;31 retains to [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]].<ref name=\"rochester east quad\">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=o18 |title=Rochester East Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1997 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> Over this stretch, NY&nbsp;31 maintains a constant southeasterly progression as it passes through southeastern Rochester and the town of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]]. As the route exits downtown Rochester, it intersects I-490 at exit&nbsp;18. The route continues onward, passing Cobbs Hill Park and entering Brighton, where it traverses areas more commercial in nature<ref name=\"bing2\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2s0Jo0z |link=no |title=overview map of NY 31 from Rochester to Verona |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref> and meets the former routing of NY&nbsp;47 a second time in an area of town known as Twelve Corners.<ref name=\"1981map\"/>\n\n====Eastern suburbs and Wayne County====\n[[File:NY 31 in Pittsford NY 1.JPG|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 in Brighton]]\nIn the eastern portion of Brighton, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[Interstate 590|I-590]] by way of an interchange and intersects [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]]. From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], NY&nbsp;31 joins [[New York State Route 21|NY&nbsp;21]] through the center of the village.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 west at NY 89.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching NY&nbsp;89 on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in [[Tyre, New York|Tyre]]]]\nFrom Palmyra east, the route parallels the Erie Canal for a considerable distance. Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County. The route proceeds across the northeastern most corner of the county before crossing into [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] via a bridge over the Erie Canal after just {{convert|1.5|mi|1}}.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n===Central New York===\nShortly after entering Cayuga County, NY&nbsp;31 crosses and begins to parallel the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]), which NY&nbsp;31 does for most of its routing west of the outer [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] suburbs. In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time. The route continues southeast into the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]] and the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of the same name]] within, where NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

From [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]] to Medina, however, Route&nbsp;20 was routed on modern NY&nbsp;31 instead.

From [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]] to Jordan, NY&nbsp;31 used a slightly different routing.

Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. Each Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) in the following order: Satya Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

The village was on the north shore of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the [[Pamunkey River]] and the [[Mattaponi River]] at [[West Point, Virginia]]. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\".

As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them.

In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers===\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him.

Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown.

He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control.

John Smith Monument as it appeared c. 1914, Isles of Shoals]]\nThe Captain John Smith Monument currently lies in disrepair off the coast of [[New Hampshire]] on [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]], part of the [[Isles of Shoals]]. The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top. (See the postcard to the right.) The pillar featured three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.<ref>J.

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of ''The Proceedings'' is thought to be better constructed than ''A Map of Virginia''.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=48}}\n\n==Publications==\nJohn Smith published eight volumes during his life.

He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] in America in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the [[Virginia Colony]] between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Prince of [[Transylvania]], and his friend [[M\u00f3zes Sz\u00e9kely]].\n\nJamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, \"[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat|He that will not work, shall not eat]]\", alluding to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/2 Thessalonians#3:10|2 Thessalonians 3:10]].<ref name=SnellCh4>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4}}</ref> Harsh weather, lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and Indian attacks almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.\n\nSmith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the [[New World]]. He named the region of New England and noted: \"Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land.\u2026 If he have nothing but his hands, he may\u2026 by industries quickly grow rich.\"<ref>David Cressy (1987). \"Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century\". p. 99.

The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain [[Edward Maria Wingfield]], president of the council, chose the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease.

During this time, they wasted much of the three months that Newport and his crew were in port loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool's gold).

The village was on the north shore of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the [[Pamunkey River]] and the [[Mattaponi River]] at [[West Point, Virginia]]. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\". There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life.<ref>[[Jill Lepore|Lepore, Jill]], \"The New Yorker\", 2 April 2007, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.<ref>Gleach, ''Powhatan's World'', pp. 118\u201321.; Kupperman, ''Indians and English'', pp. 114, 174.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | author=Horwitz, Tony | title=A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | isbn=978-0-8050-7603-5 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 336] | url=https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 | date=29 April 2008 }}</ref> David A. Price notes in ''Love and Hate in Jamestown'' that this is purely speculation, since little is known of Powhatan rituals and there is no evidence for any similar rituals among other Indian tribes in America.<ref>pp. 243\u201344</ref> Smith told a similar story in ''True Travels'' (1630) of having been rescued by the intervention of a young girl after being captured in 1602 by [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in Hungary. [[Karen Kupperman]] suggests that he \"presented those remembered events from decades earlier\" when telling the story of Pocahontas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/jamestownproject00kupp <!-- quote=The Jamestown Project. --> Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Jamestown Project''], Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007, 51\u201360, 125\u20136</ref> Whatever really happened, the encounter initiated a friendly relationship between the Indians and the colonists at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.<ref>Symonds, ''Proceedings'', pp. 251\u20132; Smith, ''Generall Historie'', pp. 198\u20139, 259.</ref> Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop.

These explorations are commemorated in the [[Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail]], established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers===\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the ''Sea Venture''. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.<ref name=\"SnellCh4\" /> Somers returned to Bermuda with the ''Patience'' to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The ''Patience'' then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.\n\nSmith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown.

Smith was convinced that Hunt's actions were directed at him; by inflaming the local population, Smith said, he could \"prevent that intent I had to make a plantation there\", keeping the country in \"obscuritie\" so that Hunt and a few merchants could monopolize it.{{sfn|Smith|1907|p=II:4}} According to Smith, Hunt had taken his maps and notes of the area to defeat's Smith's settlement plans.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1616|p=47}} reprinted in {{harvnb|Arber|1910|p=I:219}}.</ref> He could not believe that Hunt was driven by greed since there was \"little private gaine\" to be gotten; Hunt \"sold those silly Salvages for Rials of eight.\"{{sfn|Smith|1907|pp=II:4\u20135}}\n\nSmith published a map in 1616 based on the expedition which was the first to bear the label \"New England\", though the Indian place names were replaced by the names of English cities at the request of [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]].<ref name=\"globe_1614\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/14/the-lie-that-charted-new-england-future/qLDvF4PTlo1EetZbtUh4rI/story.html|title=The lie that charted New England's future|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> The settlers of [[Plymouth Colony]] adopted the name that Smith gave to that area,<ref name=\"globe_1614\" /> and other place names on the map survive today, such as the [[Charles River]] (marked as The River Charles) and [[Cape Ann]] (Cape Anna).\n\n[[File:Descr.of.New England-Title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''[[A Description of New England]]'' (1616)]]\nSmith made two attempts in 1614 and 1615 to return to the same coast. On the first trip, a storm dismasted his ship. In the second attempt, he was captured by French pirates off the coast of the [[Azore Islands|Azores]]. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he published an account of his two voyages as ''[[A Description of New England]]''. He remained in England for the rest of his life.\n\nSmith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had \"large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people\", but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1616|p=26}} reprinted in {{harvnb|Arber|1910|p=I:205}}.</ref> This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations.

The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top. (See the postcard to the right.) The pillar featured three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.<ref>J.

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of ''The Proceedings'' is thought to be better constructed than ''A Map of Virginia''.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=48}}\n\n==Publications==\nJohn Smith published eight volumes during his life.
