{"title_page": "Ringtone", "text_new": "{{short description|Sound made by a telephone to indicate an incoming call or text message}}\n{{Other uses}}\n\nA '''ringtone''' or '''ring tone''' is the sound made by a [[telephone]] to indicate an incoming call or [[text message]].  Not literally a [[Musical tone|tone]] nor an actual (bell-like) ring any more, the term is most often used today to refer to customizable sounds used on [[mobile phone]]s.\n\n==Background==\nA telephone rings when the telephone network indicates an incoming call, so that the recipient is alerted of the call attempt. [[Landline]] telephones typically receive an electric alternating current signal, called ''power ringing'' or ''ringing signal'', generated by the [[telephone exchange]] to which the telephone is connected. The ringing current originally operated an [[electric bell]]. For mobile phones, the network sends a message to the recipient's device, which may activate a sound, or a visual or vibrating indication.\n\nOn a [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] interface, this signal is created by superimposing ringing voltage atop the \u221248&nbsp;VDC already on the line.  This is done at the Central Office, or a neighborhood multiplexer called a \"SLC\" for Subscriber Line Carrier. (SLC is a trademark of Alcatel-Lucent, but is often used generically.) Telephones with electromagnetic ringers are still in widespread use. The ringing signal in North America is normally specified at ca. 90 [[volt]]s AC with a frequency of 20 [[hertz]]. In Europe it is around 60\u201390 VAC with a frequency of 25&nbsp;Hz. Some non-[[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Company]] system party lines in the US used multiple frequencies for selective ringing. Ringing voltage is produced by various sources. Large central offices used motor-driven generator sets for both ringing and other signals such as dial tone and busy signals. In smaller offices, special sub-cycle<ref>http://www.telephonecollectors.info/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=319&Itemid=2</ref> magnetic oscillators were used.  Typically, solid-state oscillators have replaced them. Originally this voltage was used to trigger an electromagnet to ring a bell installed inside the telephone, or in a nearby mounted ringer box. [[Fixed phone]]s of the late 20th century and later detect this ringing current voltage and trigger a warbling tone electronically. Mobile phones have been fully digital since the early 1990s second-generation (\"2G\") devices, hence are signaled to ring as part of the protocol they use to communicate with the cell base stations.\n\nWhile the sound produced is still called a \"ring\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ring|title=ring|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=26 October 2016|quote=Meaning \"a call on the telephone\" is from 1900; to give (someone) a ring \"call on the telephone\" was in use by 1910. Meaning \"a ringing tone\" is from 1620s; specifically \"the ringing sound made by a telephone\" by 1951.|via=Dictionary.com}}</ref> more-recently manufactured telephones electronically produce a warbling, [[chirp]]ing, or other sound. Variation of the ring signal can be used to indicate characteristics of incoming calls. For example, ringing bursts with a shorter interval between them might be used to signal a call from a given number.\n\nIn POTS switching systems, ringing is said to be \"tripped\" when the impedance of the line reduces to about 600 [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]] when the telephone handset is lifted off the switch-hook. This signals that the telephone call has been answered, and the telephone exchange immediately removes the ringing signal from the line and connects the call. This is the source of the name of the problem called \"ring-trip\" or \"pre-trip\", which occurs when the ringing signal on the line encounters excessively low resistance between the conductors, which trips the ring before the subscriber's actual telephone has a chance to ring (for more than a very short time); this is common with wet connections and improperly installed lines.\n\nThe ringing pattern is known as ring cadence. This only applies to POTS fixed phones, where the high voltage ring signal is switched on and off to create the ringing pattern. In North America, the standard ring cadence is \"2-4\", or two seconds of ringing followed by four seconds of silence (33% Duty Cycle). In Australia and the UK, the standard ring cadence is 400 ms on, 200 ms off, 400 ms on, 2000 ms off. These patterns may vary from region to region, and other patterns are used in different countries around the world. Some central offices offer [[distinctive ring]] to identify which of multiple numbers on the same line is being called, a pattern once widely used on [[party line (telephony)]].\n\nIn many systems, including North America [[Bellcore]] standards, [[Caller ID]] signals are sent during the silent interval between the first and second bursts of the ringing signals.\n\nThe caller is informed about the progress of the call by the audible ringing signal, often called [[ringback tone]]. Power ringing and audible ringing are not synchronized.\n\n==History==\nAT&T offered seven different gong combinations for the \"C\" type ringer found in the model [[Model 500 telephone|500]] and [[Western Electric model 2500 telephone|2500]] landline telephone sets. These gongs provided \"distinctive tones\" for hearing-impaired customers and also made it possible to distinguish the specific telephone that was ringing when several telephones were placed in close proximity.<ref>AT&T,  Bell System Practices, Section 501-250-303 Issue 4, ''C-Type Ringers\u2014Maintenance.'', Sept. 1978.</ref> A \"Bell Chime\" was also offered, which could be set to sound like a doorbell or to ring like a standard telephone.\n\nWhile rings, ringers, ring signals, or what might be viewed as the call signals which are the predecessors of ringtones, date back to the beginnings of telephony, modern ringtones appeared in the 1960s and have expanded into tunes and many customizable tones or melodies.<ref>[http://ringtones.specialtyansweringservice.net/ History of the Ringtone]</ref> Arguably the first ringtone (in the modern sense) appeared in the movie ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' in 1966, where the head of the secret government agency had a red phone that connected directly to the President and rang with a distinctive musical ringtone.<ref>http://apocalypzia.com/files/files/spies2.html</ref>\n[[File:FeAp 92-1a - main PCB - ITT SAA 1094-2-8636.jpg|thumb|A tone ringer IC: [[ITT Inc.|ITT]] SAA 1094]]\nFollowing a 1975 [[FCC (US)|FCC]] [[Carterfone decision|ruling which permitted third-party devices]] to be connected to phone lines, manufacturers produced accessory telephone ringers which rang with electronic tones or melodies rather than mechanical bells. People also made their own ringers which used the chip from a musical [[greeting card]] to play a melody on the arrival of a call.<ref>Sokolowski, Steve (1989). \"Customize Your Phone\", Ch. 8 \"Telephone Melody Ringer\".

On November 1998, Digitalphone Groupe ([[SoftBank Mobile]]) started a similar service in Japan.\n\n==Generation software==\nA ring tone maker is an application that converts a user chosen song or other audio file for use as a ringtone of a mobile phone. The ringtone file is installed in the mobile phone either by direct cable connection, Bluetooth, text messaging, or e-mail. On many websites, users may create ring tones from [[digital music]] or audio.\n\nThe earliest ringtone maker was Harmonium, developed by Vesa-Matti Paananen, a Finnish computer programmer, and released in 1997 for use with [[Nokia]] smart messaging.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074348/http://www.m-e-f.org/index.php?id=391 First ever MEF Special Recognition Award goes to the pioneer of the mobile ringtone business \u2014 \"Vesku\" Paananen], a June 4, 2004 press release from the [[Mobile Entertainment Forum]]</ref><ref name=\"ny2005\">[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/07/050307crmu_music?printable=true Ring My Bell], a 2005 article from ''[[The New Yorker]]''</ref>\n\nAndy Clarke, while working for UK Phone Provider Orange, helped created the B5 Ringtone License with the UK's [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] in 1998. In 1999, Clarke registered ringtone.net and setup what is believed to be the world's first \"legal\" ringtone business. Scott Memphis, leader singer of Sunday Morning Sanctuary, wrote a 2010 hit entitled, \"Ringtones & Lullabies\" inspired by with the B5 Ringtone Licensing of 1998.\n\nSome providers have features for users to create music tones, either with a \"melody composer\" or a sample/loop arranger, such as the MusicDJ in many Sony Ericsson phones. These often use encoding formats only available to one particular phone model or brand.

Not literally a [[Musical tone|tone]] nor an actual (bell-like) ring any more, the term is most often used today to refer to customizable sounds used on [[mobile phone]]s.\n\n==Background==\nA telephone rings when the telephone network indicates an incoming call, so that the recipient is alerted of the call attempt. [[Landline]] telephones typically receive an electric alternating current signal, called ''power ringing'' or ''ringing signal'', generated by the [[telephone exchange]] to which the telephone is connected. The ringing current originally operated an [[electric bell]]. For mobile phones, the network sends a message to the recipient's device, which may activate a sound, or a visual or vibrating indication.\n\nOn a [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] interface, this signal is created by superimposing ringing voltage atop the \u221248&nbsp;VDC already on the line.  This is done at the Central Office, or a neighborhood multiplexer called a \"SLC\" for Subscriber Line Carrier. (SLC is a trademark of Alcatel-Lucent, but is often used generically.) Telephones with electromagnetic ringers are still in widespread use. The ringing signal in North America is normally specified at ca. 90 [[volt]]s AC with a frequency of 20 [[hertz]]. In Europe it is around 60\u201390 VAC with a frequency of 25&nbsp;Hz. Some non-[[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Company]] system party lines in the US used multiple frequencies for selective ringing. Ringing voltage is produced by various sources. Large central offices used motor-driven generator sets for both ringing and other signals such as dial tone and busy signals. In smaller offices, special sub-cycle<ref>http://www.telephonecollectors.info/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=319&Itemid=2</ref> magnetic oscillators were used.  Typically, solid-state oscillators have replaced them. Originally this voltage was used to trigger an electromagnet to ring a bell installed inside the telephone, or in a nearby mounted ringer box. [[Fixed phone]]s of the late 20th century and later detect this ringing current voltage and trigger a warbling tone electronically. Mobile phones have been fully digital since the early 1990s second-generation (\"2G\") devices, hence are signaled to ring as part of the protocol they use to communicate with the cell base stations.\n\nWhile the sound produced is still called a \"ring\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ring|title=ring|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=26 October 2016|quote=Meaning \"a call on the telephone\" is from 1900; to give (someone) a ring \"call on the telephone\" was in use by 1910. Meaning \"a ringing tone\" is from 1620s; specifically \"the ringing sound made by a telephone\" by 1951.|via=Dictionary.com}}</ref> more-recently manufactured telephones electronically produce a warbling, [[chirp]]ing, or other sound. Variation of the ring signal can be used to indicate characteristics of incoming calls. For example, ringing bursts with a shorter interval between them might be used to signal a call from a given number.\n\nIn POTS switching systems, ringing is said to be \"tripped\" when the impedance of the line reduces to about 600 [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]] when the telephone handset is lifted off the switch-hook. This signals that the telephone call has been answered, and the telephone exchange immediately removes the ringing signal from the line and connects the call. This is the source of the name of the problem called \"ring-trip\" or \"pre-trip\", which occurs when the ringing signal on the line encounters excessively low resistance between the conductors, which trips the ring before the subscriber's actual telephone has a chance to ring (for more than a very short time); this is common with wet connections and improperly installed lines.\n\nThe ringing pattern is known as ring cadence. This only applies to POTS fixed phones, where the high voltage ring signal is switched on and off to create the ringing pattern. In North America, the standard ring cadence is \"2-4\", or two seconds of ringing followed by four seconds of silence (33% Duty Cycle). In Australia and the UK, the standard ring cadence is 400 ms on, 200 ms off, 400 ms on, 2000 ms off. These patterns may vary from region to region, and other patterns are used in different countries around the world. Some central offices offer [[distinctive ring]] to identify which of multiple numbers on the same line is being called, a pattern once widely used on [[party line (telephony)]].\n\nIn many systems, including North America [[Bellcore]] standards, [[Caller ID]] signals are sent during the silent interval between the first and second bursts of the ringing signals.\n\nThe caller is informed about the progress of the call by the audible ringing signal, often called [[ringback tone]]. Power ringing and audible ringing are not synchronized.\n\n==History==\nAT&T offered seven different gong combinations for the \"C\" type ringer found in the model [[Model 500 telephone|500]] and [[Western Electric model 2500 telephone|2500]] landline telephone sets. These gongs provided \"distinctive tones\" for hearing-impaired customers and also made it possible to distinguish the specific telephone that was ringing when several telephones were placed in close proximity.<ref>AT&T,  Bell System Practices, Section 501-250-303 Issue 4, ''C-Type Ringers\u2014Maintenance.'', Sept. 1978.</ref> A \"Bell Chime\" was also offered, which could be set to sound like a doorbell or to ring like a standard telephone.\n\nWhile rings, ringers, ring signals, or what might be viewed as the call signals which are the predecessors of ringtones, date back to the beginnings of telephony, modern ringtones appeared in the 1960s and have expanded into tunes and many customizable tones or melodies.<ref>[http://ringtones.specialtyansweringservice.net/ History of the Ringtone]</ref> Arguably the first ringtone (in the modern sense) appeared in the movie ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' in 1966, where the head of the secret government agency had a red phone that connected directly to the President and rang with a distinctive musical ringtone.<ref>http://apocalypzia.com/files/files/spies2.html</ref>\n[[File:FeAp 92-1a - main PCB - ITT SAA 1094-2-8636.jpg|thumb|A tone ringer IC: [[ITT Inc.|ITT]] SAA 1094]]\nFollowing a 1975 [[FCC (US)|FCC]] [[Carterfone decision|ruling which permitted third-party devices]] to be connected to phone lines, manufacturers produced accessory telephone ringers which rang with electronic tones or melodies rather than mechanical bells.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian Government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice-President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, [[Radio Uganda]] erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment.

That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. According to this version of events, the invasion was intended as a suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain. Dozens of soldiers of the Masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed, rival State Research Bureau agents engaged in a shootout in Kampala, and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{see also|Air campaign of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War}}\n=== First attack ===\n[[File:T-55 skos RB.jpg|thumb|The Ugandan attack included numerous [[Vehicle armour|armoured vehicles]], including [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks (example pictured) ]]\n\nAt dawn on 25 October{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first major attack took place on 22 October.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} Journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that fighting began when the Uganda Army started to shell Bukoba on 27 October.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=2}} }} Tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of Ugandan vehicular activity in Mutukula. Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire. One Tanzanian soldier suffered minor injuries in the clashes.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Bukoba View.JPG|thumb|left|Ugandan aircraft attacked [[Bukoba]] (pictured) on 18 and 27 October 1978.]]\nThe sound of gunfire could be heard from Bukoba, and Tanzanian civilians in the West Lake region became increasingly anxious about the situation. Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG. The pilot ejected before his jet crashed and managed to safely return to Uganda.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nMeanwhile, in the area surrounding Bukoba, displaced persons from the town and the border region began gathering. Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian Government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice-President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, [[Radio Uganda]] erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment.

That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. According to this version of events, the invasion was intended as a suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain. Dozens of soldiers of the Masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed, rival State Research Bureau agents engaged in a shootout in Kampala, and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{see also|Air campaign of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War}}\n=== First attack ===\n[[File:T-55 skos RB.jpg|thumb|The Ugandan attack included numerous [[Vehicle armour|armoured vehicles]], including [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks (example pictured) ]]\n\nAt dawn on 25 October{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first major attack took place on 22 October.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} Journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that fighting began when the Uganda Army started to shell Bukoba on 27 October.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=2}} }} Tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of Ugandan vehicular activity in Mutukula. Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire. One Tanzanian soldier suffered minor injuries in the clashes.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Bukoba View.JPG|thumb|left|Ugandan aircraft attacked [[Bukoba]] (pictured) on 18 and 27 October 1978.]]\nThe sound of gunfire could be heard from Bukoba, and Tanzanian civilians in the West Lake region became increasingly anxious about the situation. Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG. The pilot ejected before his jet crashed and managed to safely return to Uganda.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nMeanwhile, in the area surrounding Bukoba, displaced persons from the town and the border region began gathering. Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

It was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in [[Pre-Columbian era#North America|pre-Columbian North America]]. After contact with [[:Category:Spanish explorers of the Pacific|Spanish explorers]], most of the Native Americans died out from European diseases.\n\nAfter the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of 1769\u201370, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 [[Spanish missions in California|California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper) California]], beginning with the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Mission San Diego de Alcala]] near the location of the modern day city of San Diego, California. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). Two of the pueblos would eventually grow into the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. After Mexican Independence was won in 1821, California fell under the jurisdiction of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. Fearing the influence of the Roman Catholic church over their newly independent nation, the Mexican government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|closed all of the missions]] and nationalized the church's property. They left behind a small \"[[Californio]]\" (white Hispanic) population of several thousand families, with a few small military garrisons. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u201348, Mexico was forced to relinquish any claim to California to the United States. The unexpected discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 produced a spectacular [[California Gold Rush|gold rush in Northern California]], attracting hundreds of thousand of ambitious young men from around the world. Only a few struck it rich, and many returned home disappointed. Most appreciated the other economic opportunities in California, especially in agriculture, and brought their families to join them. California became the 31st US state in 1850 and played a small role in the American Civil War. Chinese immigrants increasingly came under attack from [[Nativism (politics)#United States|nativists]]; they were forced out of industry and agriculture and into [[Chinatown]]s in the larger cities. As gold petered out, California increasingly became a highly productive agricultural society. The coming of the railroads in 1869 linked its rich economy with the rest of the nation, and attracted a steady stream of migrants. In the late 19th century, Southern California, especially Los Angeles, started to grow rapidly.\n\n==History of California through 1899==\n{{main|History of California through 1899}}\n\n===Pre-contact period===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n[[File:Tikhanov - Balthazar Inhabitant of Northern California (1818).png|200px|thumb|''Balthazar, [[indigenous peoples of California|Inhabitant of Northern California]]'', painting by [[Mikhail Tikhanov]].]]\nDifferent tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] lived in the area that is now California for an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 years.

He died in southern California in 1543. Cabrillo and his men found that there was essentially nothing for the Spanish to easily exploit in California, and located at the extreme limits of exploration and trade from Spain it would be left essentially unexplored and unsettled for the next 234 years.\n\nThe Cabrillo expedition depicted the Indigenous populations as living at a subsistence level, typically located in small [[rancheria]]s of extended family groups of [[Dunbar's number|100 to 150 people]].<ref name=\"fourdir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/california_cultures.htm|publisher=Four Directions Institute|title=California Indian Cultures|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> They had no apparent agriculture as understood by Europeans, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery; their tools were made out of wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stone, and antler. Some shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tules]] and/or mud.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/> The Cabrillo expedition did not see the far north of California, where on the coast and somewhat inland traditional architecture consists of rectangular redwood or cedar plank semisubterranean houses.\n\nTraditional clothing was minimal in the summer, with tanned deerhide and other animal leathers and furs and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Feathers were sewn into prayer pieces worn for ceremonies. Some tribes around [[Santa Barbara, California]] and the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]] were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast carved redwood [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] canoes.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/>\n\nThe staple foods then used by other Indigenous American tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without irrigation in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see [[Mediterranean climate]]). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, and the environmental management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico.<ref>Lightfoot, Kent and Otis Parrish (2009).

This tradition of landscape management through fire ecology maintained acorn groves and other food sources, which along with knowledge of migratory herds such as elk and anadromous runs of salmon in the rivers, supported villages, small tribes, and extended family groups.\n\nA dietary staple for most Indigenous populations in interior California was [[acorn]]s, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, soaked in water to leach out their [[tannin]], and cooked. The grinding holes worn into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429222224/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-04-29 | title=Virtual Tours}}</ref> The ground and leached acorn flour was usually cooked into a nutritious mush, eaten daily with other traditional foods.

Local trade between Indigenous populations enabled them to acquire seasonings such as salt, or foodstuffs and other goods that might be rare in certain locales, such as flint or obsidian for making spear and arrow points. Native cultures in California are much different from other cultures of Indigenous populations in North America, and some have survived to the present day.\n\nCalifornia indigenous language diversity numbered 80 to 90 languages and dialects, some surviving to the present although endangered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|accessdate=25 February 2018|title=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523020014/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The high and rugged [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains located behind the [[Great Basin Desert]] east of California, extensive forests and mountains in the north, the rugged and harsh [[Sonoran Desert]] and [[Mojave Desert]] in the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west effectively isolated California from easy trade or tribal interactions with Indigenous populations on the rest of the continent, and delayed the tragedies and damages of colonial-settler arrival until the Spanish missions, the Gold Rush, and the Euro-American invasion of indigenous Californians' territories.\n\n====Spanish trading route (1565)====\nIn 1565 the Spanish developed a trading route where they took gold and silver from the Americas and traded it for goods and spices from China and other Asian areas. The Spanish set up their main base in the [[Philippines]]. The trade with Mexico involved using an annual passage of [[Manila galleon]](s). The Eastbound galleons first went north to about 40 degrees [[latitude]] and then turning East they could use the westerly [[trade wind]]s and currents. These galleons, after crossing most of the Pacific Ocean, would arrive off the California coast from 60 to over 120 days later somewhere near [[Cape Mendocino]] (about {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of San Francisco) at about 40 degrees N. latitude. They then could turn south down the California coast utilizing the available winds and the south flowing (about 1&nbsp;mi/hr (1.6&nbsp;km/h)) [[California Current]]. After sailing about {{convert|1500|mi|km|}} south on they eventually reached their home port in Mexico. [[San Francisco Bay]] escaped discovery for two centuries until it was finally discovered by land exploration in 1769.\n\n====Francis Drake's claim (1579)====\n[[File:Sir Francis Drake Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach, Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California.JPG|thumb|Francis Drake \"Nova Albion\" Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach]]\nThe English explorer and [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]] sailed south along the coast of northern California in 1579 after capturing two Spanish treasure ships in the Pacific. It is believed Drake put ashore somewhere north of San Francisco, where the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' underwent extensive repairs and accumulated needed supplies for a trip across the Pacific. Leaving California, he completed the second recorded [[circumnavigation]] of the world (after [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) in 1580.\n\nThe exact location of Drake's port is still undetermined, but a prominent bay on the California coast, [[Drakes Bay]], bears his name. He claimed all the land south of 42 degrees latitude, north of the imprecise Spanish claims and eastward from coast to coast for England, calling it [[Nova Albion]]. The term \"Nova Albion\" was often used on European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish claims. Spanish maps, explorations etc., of this and later eras were generally not published, being regarded as state secrets. As was typical in this era, there were conflicting claims to the same territory, and the indigenous peoples who lived there were never consulted.\n\nIn 1602, sixty years after Cabrillo, the Spaniard [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]] explored California's coastline from San Diego as far north as [[Monterey Bay]]. He named [[San Diego Bay]].  He also put ashore in [[Monterey, California]] and made glowing reports of the Monterey bay area as a possible anchorage for ships with land suitable for growing crops. He also provided rudimentary charts of the coastal waters, which were used for nearly 200 years.\n\n===Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)===\n[[File:Misi\u00f3n Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur]], was founded in 1697.]]\n\n{{anchor|Spanishsettlement}}The Spanish divided California into two parts, [[Baja California]] and [[Alta California]], as provinces of [[New Spain]] (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the [[Baja Peninsula]] and terminated roughly at [[San Diego, California]] where Alta California started. The eastern and northern boundaries of Alta California were very indefinite, as the Spanish, despite a lack of physical presence and settlements, claimed essentially everything in what is now the western United States.\n\nThe first permanent [[Spanish missions in Baja California|mission]] in Baja California, [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], was founded  on October 15, 1697, by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Juan Maria Salvatierra]] (1648\u20131717) accompanied by one small boat's crew and six soldiers. After the establishment of Missions in Alta California after 1769, the Spanish treated Baja California and Alta California as a single administrative unit, part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], with [[Monterey, California]], as its capital.\n\nNearly all the missions in Baja California were established by members of the [[Jesuit]] order supported by a few soldiers. After a power dispute between [[Charles III of Spain]] and the Jesuits, the Jesuit colleges were closed and the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuits were expelled]] from Mexico and South America in 1767 and deported back to Spain. After the forcible expulsion of the Jesuit order, most of the missions were taken over by [[Franciscan]] and later [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars. Both of these groups were under much more direct control of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. This reorganization left many missions abandoned in Sonora Mexico and Baja California.\n\n[[File:Map of California as an island R.W. Seale 1745.jpg|thumb|This 1745 map by British cartographer R.W. Seale misrepresented California as an island.]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France and their allies (called the [[French and Indian War]] in the British colonies on the East Coast)  (1754\u20131763), France was driven out of North America. Spain and Britain were the only colonial powers left. Britain, as yet, had no Pacific colonies in North America. The Bourbon King [[Charles III of Spain]] established [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and other outposts in [[Alta California]] out of fear that the territory would be claimed by the British, who not only had 13 colonies on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], but also several islands in the Caribbean, and had recently taken over [[Canada under British rule (1763\u20131867)|Canada]] from the French.\n\nOne of Spain's gains from the Seven Years' War was the French [[Louisiana Territory]] which was secretly given to Spain. Another potential colonial power already established in the Pacific was Russia, whose [[Maritime Fur Trade]] of mostly sea otter and fur seals was pressing down from Alaska to the [[Pacific Northwest]]'s lower reaches. These furs could be traded in China for large profits.\n\nThe Spanish settlement of Alta California was the last colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, and they tried to do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately half the cost of settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Pueblo Revolt]] among the [[Pueblo Indians]] of the [[Rio Grande]] valley in the 1680s as well as [[Pima Indian Revolt]] in 1751 and the ongoing [[Seri people|Seri]] conflicts in [[Sonora Mexico]] provided the [[Franciscan]] friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.<ref>Starr, Kevin. ''California: A History''. New York: Modern Library (2005), Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nThe remoteness and isolation of California, the lack of large organized tribes, the lack of agricultural traditions, the absence of any domesticated animals larger than a dog, and a food supply consisting primarily of acorns (unpalatable to most Europeans) meant the missions in California would be very difficult to establish and sustain and made the area unattractive to most potential colonists. A few soldiers and friars financed by the Church and State would form the backbone of the proposed settlement of California.\n\n====Portol\u00e1 expedition (1769\u20131770)====\nIn 1769, the Spanish Visitor General, [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], planned a [[Portol\u00e0 expedition|five part expedition]], consisting of three units by sea and two by land, to start settling Alta California. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] volunteered to command the expedition. The Catholic Church was represented by [[Franciscan]] friar [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and his fellow friars. All five detachments of soldiers, friars and future colonists were to meet on the shores of San Diego Bay. The first ship, the ''San Carlos'', sailed from [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] on January 10, 1769, and the ''San Antonio'' sailed on February 15. The ''San Antonio'' arrived in San Diego Bay on April 11 and the ''San Carlos'' on April 29. The third vessel, the ''San Jos\u00e9'', left [[New Spain]] later that spring but was lost at sea with no survivors.\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Californias.svg|thumb|155px|Spanish colonial coat of arms for [[the Californias]].]]\n\nThe first land party, led by [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]], left from the Franciscan [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1|Mission San Fernando Velicata]] on March 24, 1769.

That group arrived in San Diego on May 4.

[[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando de Rivera]] was appointed to command the lead party that would scout out a land route and blaze a trail to San Diego.<ref name=\"Rivera's explorations\"/> Food was short, and the Indians accompanying them  were expected to forage for most of what they needed. Many Indian neophytes died along the way; even more deserted. The two groups traveling from Lower California on foot had to cross about {{convert|300|mi|km}} of the very dry and rugged [[Baja Peninsula]].\n\nThe part of the expedition that took place over land took about 40\u201351 days to get to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing [[California Current]] and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from [[scurvy]], and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the [[San Diego Presidio|Presidio of San Diego]] on May 14, 1769. [[Mission San Diego de Alcala]] was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).\n\nOn July 14, 1769, an expedition was dispatched from San Diego to find the port of Monterey. Not recognizing the [[Monterey Bay]] from the description written by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]]  almost 200 years prior, the expedition traveled beyond it to what is now the [[San Francisco, California]] area. The exploration party, led by Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]], arrived on November 2, 1769, at [[San Francisco Bay]].,<ref name=\"Portola\">{{cite web|title=Visitors: San Francisco Historical Information |url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |date=n.d. |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=City and County of San Francisco |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331220353/http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |archivedate=2008-03-31 }}</ref> One of the greatest ports on the west coast of America had finally been discovered by land. The expedition returned to San Diego on January 24, 1770. The Presidio and Mission of [[Charles Borromeo|San Carlos de Borromeo de Monterey]] were established on June 3, 1770, by Portola, Serra, and Crespi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/colonization.html|title=The Founding of Monterey|work=Monterey County Historical Society|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Food shortages====\nWithout any agricultural crops or experience gathering, preparing and eating the ground acorns and grass seeds the Indians subsisted on for much of the year, the shortage of food at San Diego became extremely critical during the first few months of 1770. They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then no understanding of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portol\u00e1 sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions in February to obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.\n\nFewer mouths to feed temporarily eased the drain on San Diego's scant provisions, but within weeks, acute hunger and increased sickness (scurvy) again threatened to force abandonment of the San Diego \"Mission\". Portol\u00e1 finally decided that if no relief ship arrived by March 19, 1770 they would leave to return to the \"[[New Spain]]\" missions on the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja Peninsula]] the next morning ''\"because there were not enough provisions to wait longer and the men had not come to perish from hunger.\"'' At three o'clock in the afternoon on March 19, 1770, as if by a miracle, the sails of the [[sailing ship]]  ''San Antonio'', loaded with relief supplies, were discernible on the horizon. The Spanish settlement of Alta California would continue.\n\n[[File:Juba map.jpg|thumb|Map of the route, Juan Bautista de Anza travelled in 1775-76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco via the Gila River corridor and the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River.]] [[File:Mojave-sonoran deserts.png|thumb|Mojave and Sonoran deserts block easy land travel to California.

They went across the Sonoran desert to California from Mexico by swinging south of the [[Gila River]] to avoid [[Apache]] attacks until they hit the [[Colorado River]] at the [[Yuma Crossing]]\u2014about the only way across the Colorado River. The friendly [[Quechan]] (Yuma) Indians (2-3,000) he encountered there were growing most of their food, using irrigation systems, and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\">Guerro, Vladimir; ''The Anza Trail: The Settling of California''; Heyday Books; (2006); {{ISBN|978-1-59714-026-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable [[Algodones Dunes]] west of [[Yuma, Arizona]], they followed the river about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south (to about the Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River)  before turning northwest to about today's [[Mexicali, Mexico]] and then turning north through today's [[Imperial Valley]] and then northwest again before reaching [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] near the future city of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It took Anza about 74 days to do this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California. On his return trip he went down the [[Gila River]] until hitting the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)]] and continuing on to Tubac. The return trip only took 23 days, and he encountered several peaceful and  populous agricultural tribes with irrigation systems located along the Gila River.<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\"/>\n\nIn Anza's second trip (1775\u20131776) he returned  to California with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows with them. The approximately 200 surviving cattle and an unknown number of horses (many of each were lost or eaten along the way) started the cattle and horse raising industry in California. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years. They essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. The party started from Tubac, Arizona, on October 22, 1775 and arrived at [[San Francisco Bay]] on March 28, 1776. There they established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], followed by a [[mission (station)|mission]], [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) --the future city of [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Crossing: [[Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er]] and [[Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. On July 17\u201318, 1781 the Yuma ([[Quechan]]) Indians, in a dispute with the Spanish, destroyed both missions and pueblos\u2014killing 103 soldiers, colonists, and Friars and capturing about 80 prisoners, mostly women and children. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners, but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The [[Yuma Crossing]] was closed for Spanish traffic and it would stay closed until about 1846. California was nearly isolated again from land based travel. About the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. The average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824 meant that additional colonists coming to Alta California were few and far between.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hb75yap6.htm|title=San Francisco History - Seventy-five Years in San Francisco, Appendix N.

The missions were nearly all located within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast and almost no exploration or settlements were made in the [[Central Valley (California)]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (California)]]. The only expeditions anywhere close to the Central Valley and Sierras were the rare forays by soldiers undertaken to recover runaway Indians who had escaped from the Missions. The \"settled\" territory of about 15,000 square miles (40,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was about 10% of California's eventual 156,000 square miles (400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) territory.\n\nIn 1786, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de La P\u00e9rouse]] led a group of scientists and artists who compiled an account of the Californian mission system, the land, and the people. Traders, whalers, and scientific missions followed in the next decades.\n\n====California Mission network====\nThe [[California Missions]], after they were all established, were located about one day's horseback ride apart for easier communication and linked by the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real trail]]. These Missions were typically manned by two to three friars and three to ten soldiers. Virtually all the physical work was done by  indigenous people convinced to or coerced into joining the missions. The padres provided instructions for making adobe bricks, building mission buildings, planting fields, digging irrigation ditches, growing new grains and vegetables, herding cattle and horses, singing, speaking Spanish, and understanding the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith\u2014all that was thought to be necessary to bring the Indians to be able to support themselves and their new church.\n\nThe soldiers supervised the construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, if they tried to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] observed that Indians were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking [[Californio]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dana |first=Richard Henry |authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. |title=Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea |publisher=Harper & Brothers |year=1842 |location=New York |pages=93, 97, 209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission San Luis Rey de Francia courtyard.jpg|thumb|250px|The courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, with California's oldest pepper tree (''[[Peruvian pepper|Schinus molle]]''), planted in 1830, visible through the arch.<ref>Young, p. 18</ref>]]\n\nThe missions eventually claimed about 1/6 of the available land in California or roughly {{convert|1000000|acre|km2|0}} of land per mission. The rest of the land was considered the property of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. To encourage settlement of the territory, large land grants were given to retired soldiers and colonists. Most grants were virtually free and typically went to friends and relatives in the California government. A few foreign colonists were accepted if they accepted Spanish citizenship and joined the Catholic Faith. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was still in nearly full force and forbade Protestants living in Mexican controlled territory. In the Spanish colonial period many of these grants were later turned into [[Ranchos of California|Ranchos]].\n\nSpain made about 30 of these large grants, nearly all several square leagues (1 Spanish league = {{convert|2.6|mi|km}}) each in size. The total land granted to settlers in the Spanish colonial era was about {{convert|800000|acre|km2|0}} or about {{convert|35000|acre|km2|0}} each. The few owners of these large ranchos patterned themselves after the landed gentry in Spain and were devoted to keeping themselves living in a grand style. The rest of the population they expected to support them. Their mostly unpaid workers were nearly all Spanish trained Indians or [[peons]] that had learned how to ride horses and raise some crops. The majority of the ranch hands were paid with room and board, rough clothing, rough housing and no salary.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were cattle, horses and sheep, most of which lived virtually wild. The cattle were mostly killed for fresh meat, as well as hides and tallow (fat) which could be traded or sold for money or goods. As the [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|cattle]] herds increased there came a time when nearly everything that could be made of leather was\u2014doors, window coverings, stools, [[chaps]], leggings, vests lariats ([[riata]])s, [[saddle]]s, boots  etc. Since there was no refrigeration then, often a cow was killed for the day's fresh meat and the hide and tallow salvaged for sale later. After taking the cattle's hide and tallow their carcasses were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which roamed wild in California at that time, or to feed the packs of dogs that typically lived at each rancho.\n\nA series of four ''presidios'', or \"royal forts\", each manned by 10 to 100 men, were built by Spain in Alta California. California installations were established in [[San Diego]] ([[Presidio of San Diego|El Presidio Real de San Diego]]) founded in 1769, in San Francisco ([[Presidio of San Francisco|El Presidio Real de San Francisco]]) founded in 1776, and in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] ([[Presidio of Santa Barbara|El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara]]) founded in 1782. After the Spanish colonial era the [[Presidio of Sonoma]] in [[Sonoma, California]] was founded in 1834.<ref>(For the [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] Census of 1790 listing the inhabitants of Monterey and the other presidios and pueblos, see [http://sfgenealogy.com/spanish/cen1790.htm The Census of 1790, California], California Spanish Genealogy.

The pueblos of [[History of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[History of San Diego|San Diego]], [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]], [[History of Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Villa de Branciforte]] (later abandoned before later becoming [[Santa Cruz, California]]) and the pueblo of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose, California]] were all established to support the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and presidios in California. These were the only towns (pueblos) in California.\n\n===Mexican period (1821 to 1846)===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|230px|[[First Mexican Republic|Mexico]] in 1824. [[Alta California]] is the northwestern-most country.]]\n\nIn 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Alta California became a territory rather than a full state. The territorial capital remained in [[Monterey, California]], with a governor as executive official.\n\nMexico, after independence, was unstable with about [[List of heads of state of Mexico|40 changes of government]], in the 27 years prior to 1848\u2014an average government duration was 7.9 months. In Alta California, Mexico inherited a large, sparsely settled, poor, backwater province paying little or no net tax revenue to the Mexican state. In addition, Alta California had a declining Mission system as the [[Spanish Missions of California|Mission]] Indian population in Alta California continued to rapidly decrease.\n\nThe number of Alta California settlers, always a minority of total population, slowly increased mostly by more births than deaths in the Californio population in California. After the closure of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|de Anza Trail]] across the [[Colorado River]] in 1781 immigration from Mexico was nearly all by ship. California continued to be a sparsely populated and isolated country.\n\n====Trade policy====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] the onerous Spanish rules against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet could not enforce their no-trading policies. The settlers, and their descendants (who became known as [[Californio]]s), were eager to trade for new commodities, finished goods, luxury goods, and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, a number of Europeans and Americans became naturalized Mexican citizens and settled in early California. Some of those became rancheros and traders during the Mexican period, such as [[Abel Stearns]].\n\n[[California hide trade|Cattle hides and tallow]], along with [[North American fur trade|marine mammal fur]] and other goods, provided the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian [[California hide trade|trading ships]] first appeared in California a few years before 1820. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] provides a good first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nThe main [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|port of entry]] for trading purposes was Monterey, where custom duties of up to 100% (also called [[tariffs]]) were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs. In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs, although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\">{{cite web|url=http://usgovernmentrevenue.com/index.php?year=1850#usgs302a|title=US Government Revenue, Deficit and Debt - Numbers Charts Analysis History|website=usgovernmentrevenue.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico and the mission system====\nSo many mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women. This increase in deaths was accompanied by a very low live birth rate among the surviving Indian population. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission [[Franciscan]] ''padres'' had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\">Krell, Dorothy (ed.) (1979). ''The California Missions: A Pictorial History''; p. 316; Sunset Publishing Corporation, Menlo Park, California. {{ISBN|0-376-05172-8}}</ref>\n\nIf Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have very different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/>\n\nThe missions, as originally envisioned, were to last only about ten years before being converted to ''regular'' parishes. When the California missions were abolished in 1834 some [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] had existed over 66 years but the [[Spanish missions in California|Mission]] Indians were still not self-sufficient, proficient in Spanish, or wholly Catholic. Taking people from a hunter-gatherer type existence to an educated, agricultural-based existence was much more difficult than the missionaries had originally thought. The severe and continuing decline in Mission Indian populations exacerbated this problem. In 1834 Mexico, in response to demands that the Catholic Church give up much of the Mission property, started the process of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularizing]] the [[Franciscan]] run [[Spanish missions in California|missions]]. [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834 Governor Figueroa issued his \"Decree of Confiscation.\"<ref>Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M. (1922); ''San Juan Capistrano Mission'', p. 114, Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, California</ref>\n\nNine other missions quickly followed, with six more in 1835; [[Mission San Buenaventura|San Buenaventura]] and San Francisco de As\u00eds were among the last to succumb, in June and December 1836, respectively.<ref>Yenne, Bill (2004). ''The Missions of California'', pp. 83, 93, Advantage Publishers Group, San Diego, California. {{ISBN|1-59223-319-8}}</ref> The [[Franciscan]]s soon thereafter abandoned most of the missions, taking with them almost everything of value they could, after which the locals typically plundered the mission buildings for construction materials, furniture, etc. or the mission buildings were sold off to serve other uses.\n\nIn spite of this neglect, the Indian towns at [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Dieguito Complex|San Dieguito]], and [[Las Flores Estancia|Las Flores]] did continue on for some time under a provision in Governor Echeand\u00eda's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the partial conversion of missions to new ''pueblos''.<ref>Robinson, W.W. (1948); ''Land in California'', p. 42, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California</ref> After the secularizing of the Missions, many of the surviving Mission Indians switched from being unpaid workers for the missions to unpaid laborers and vaqueros (cowboys) of the about 500 large Californio owned [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]].\n\n====Land grants====\nBefore Alta California became a part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]] to Presidio soldiers and government officials and a few friends and family of the Alta California Governors, some of whom were grandchildren of the original 1775 Anza expedition settlers. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Franciscan missions, while paving the way for additional settlers to California by making land grants easier to obtain.\n\nWhen the missions were secularized, the mission property and cattle were supposed to be mostly allocated to the missions Indians. In practice, nearly all mission property and livestock were taken over by the about 455 large [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] granted by the governors\u2014mostly to friends and family at low or no cost. The rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all distributed on former mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast.\n\nThe Mexican land grants were provisional until settled and worked on for five years, and often had very  indefinite boundaries and sometimes conflicting ownership claims. The boundaries of each rancho were almost never surveyed, and marked, and often depended on local landmarks that often changed over time. Since the government depended on import tariffs for its income, there was virtually no property tax\u2014the property tax when introduced with U.S. statehood was a big shock. The grantee could not subdivide, or rent out, the land without approval.\n\nThe rancho owners tried to live in a grand manner, and the result was similar to a [[feudal barony|barony]]. For these few rancho owners and families, this was  California's Golden Age; for the vast majority it was not golden. Much of the agriculture, vineyards, and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining Mission Indian population required less food, and the Missionaries and soldiers supporting the Missions disappeared. The new Ranchos and slowly increasing Pueblos mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade with the occasional trading ship or [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh vegetables.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were [[leather|cattle hides]] (called California greenbacks) and [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled {{convert|14000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides and tallow. The cattle and horses that provided the hides and tallow essentially grew wild.\n\nBy 1845, the province of Alta California had a non-native population of about 1,500 Spanish and Latin American-born adult men along with about 6,500 women and their native-born children (who became the Californios). These Spanish-speakers lived mostly in the southern half of the state from San Diego north to Santa Barbara.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There were also around 1300 American immigrants and 500 European immigrants from a wide variety of backgrounds. Nearly all of these were adult males and a majority lived in central and northern California from Monterey north to Sonoma and east to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA large non-coastal land grant was given to [[John Sutter]] who, in 1839, settled a large land grant close to the future city of [[Sacramento, California]], which he called \"[[New Helvetia]]\" (''New Switzerland''). There, he built an extensive fort equipped with much of the armament from [[Fort Ross]]\u2014bought from the Russians on credit when they abandoned that fort. [[Sutter's Fort]] was the first non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community in the California [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. Sutter's Fort, from 1839 to about 1848, was a major agricultural and trade colony in California, often welcoming and assisting [[California Trail]] travelers to California. Most of the settlers at, or near, Sutter's Fort were new immigrants from the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055153/http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-05-08 | title=John Sutter, Sutters Fort}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485|title=Sutter''s Fort SHP|first=California State Parks, State of|last=California|website=CA State Parks|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n====Annexation of California (1846\u20131847)====\n{{main|Conquest of California|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n<!--As I commented at the new article \"Conquest of California\", I have a problem with this wording. \"Conquest of California\" seems very non-neutral.

Several battles between U.S. and Mexican troops led the United States Congress to issue a declaration of war against Mexico on May 13, 1846; the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] had begun. Word of the conflict reached Alta California about a month later.\n\nThe main forces available to the United States in California were the bluejacket sailors and U.S. Marines on board the ships of the [[Pacific Squadron]]. Speculating that war with Mexico over Texas and other land was very possible, the [[U.S. Navy]] had sent several additional naval vessels to the Pacific in 1845 to protect U.S. interests there. It took about 200 days, on average, for ships to travel the greater than {{convert|17000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip from the East coast around [[Cape Horn]] of South America to California.\n\nInitially as the war with Mexico started there were five vessels in the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron near California. In 1846 and 1847 this was increased to 13 Navy vessels\u2014over half the U.S. Navy's available ships. The only other U.S. military force then in California was the about 30 military topographers etc. and 30 mountain men, guides, hunters, etc. in Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] exploratory force. They were exiting California on their way to what is now [[Oregon]] when they got word in early June 1846 that war was imminent and a revolt had already started in [[Sonoma, California]]. Hearing rumors of possible Californio military action against the newly arrived settlers in California (this had already happened in 1840),<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''A History of California'', The Macmillan Company 1922, p. 191 (Google eBook)</ref> some settlers decided to neutralize the small Californio garrison at Sonoma, California. On June 15, 1846, some thirty settlers, mostly American citizens, staged a revolt and seized the small Californio garrison, in Sonoma, without firing a shot and declared the new [[California Republic]] government. On hearing of this revolt, Fremont and his exploratory force returned to California. The \"republic\" never exercised any real authority and only lasted 26 days before accepting U.S. government control.\n\nThe former fleet surgeon William M. Wood and  John Parrot, the American Consul of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], arrived in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico on May 10, 1846. There they heard word of the ongoing hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico forces and sent a message by special courier back to Commodore ([[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]]) [[John D. Sloat]], commander of the [[Pacific Squadron]] then visiting Mazatl\u00e1n Mexico. On May 17, 1846, this courier's  messages informed Commodore Sloat that hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico had commenced.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846\u20131848, p. 201, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref>\n\nCommodore (Rear Admiral) John D.

The Mexican government by 1846 had already had 40 [[List of heads of state of Mexico|presidents]] in the first 24 years of its existence. Most new settlers and Californios were neutral or actively supported the revolt. An independent group of men called \"Los Osos\" raised the \"[[Bear Flag]]\" of the [[California Republic]] over Sonoma. The republic was in existence scarcely more than 25 days before Fr\u00e9mont returned and took over on June 23 from [[William B. Ide]] the leader of the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. The California state flag of today is based on this original Bear Flag and still contains the words \"California Republic.\"[[John A. Sutter]] and his men and supplies at Sutter's Fort joined the revolt.\n\n====US capture of coastal ports and towns====\nIn 1846, the U.S. Navy was under orders to take over all California ports in the event of war. There were about 400 to 500 [[U.S. Marines]] and U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors available for possible land action on the Pacific Squadron's ships. Hearing word of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma, California, and the arrival of the large British 2,600-ton, 600-man man-of-war {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}} flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, outside Monterey Harbor, Commodore Sloat was finally stirred to action. On July 7, 1846, seven weeks after war had been declared, Sloat instructed the captains of the ships {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} and [[sloops-of-war|sloops]] {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} of the [[Pacific Squadron]] in [[Monterey Bay]] to occupy [[Battle of Monterey|Monterey, California]]\u2014the Alta California capital. Fifty American marines and about 100 bluejacket sailors landed and captured the city without incident\u2014the few Californio troops formerly there having already evacuated the city. They raised the flag of the United States without firing a shot. The only shots fired were a 21-gun salute to the new U.S. flag fired by each of the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846-1848, p. 252, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref> The British ships observed but took no action.\n\nThe abandoned [[Presidio]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) at San Francisco, then called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], were occupied without firing a shot on July 9, 1846, by U.S. marines and U.S. Navy sailors from the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}. Militia Captain [[Thomas Fallon]] led a small force of about 22 men from [[Santa Cruz, California]], and captured the small town of [[History of San Jose, California|Pueblo de San Jose]] without bloodshed on July 11, 1846. Fallon received an American flag from Commodore John D. Sloat and raised it over the pueblo on July 14. On July 15, 1846, Commodore ([[Rear Admiral]]) Sloat transferred his command of the Pacific Squadron to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] when Stockton's ship, the frigate {{USS|Congress|1841|6}}, arrived from the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] (Hawaii).\n\nStockton, a much more aggressive leader, asked Fremont to form a joint force of Fremont's soldiers, scouts, guides, and others, and a volunteer militia\u2014many who were former Bear Flag Revolters. This unit, called the [[California Battalion]], was mustered into U.S. service and were paid regular army wages. On July 19, Fr\u00e9mont's newly formed \"California Battalion\" swelled to about 160 men. These men included Fremont's 30 topographical men and their 30 scouts and hunters, U.S. Marine Lieutenant [[Archibald H. Gillespie]], a U.S. Navy officer to handle their two [[cannon]]s, a company of Indians trained by Sutter and many other ''permanent'' California settlers from several different countries as well as American settlers. The California Battalion members were used mainly to garrison and keep order in the rapidly surrendering California towns.\n\nThe Navy went down the coast from San Francisco, occupying ports without resistance as they went. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of San Diego|San Diego]] surrendered 29 July 1846 without a shot being fired. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] surrendered without a shot being fired in August 1846.\n\n====Taking of Los Angeles====\nOn August 13, 1846, a joint force of U.S. Marines, bluejacket sailors and parts of Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion carried by the {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, California with flags flying and band playing. USMC Captain Archibald H. Gillespie, (Fr\u00e9mont's second in command of the [[California Battalion]]), with an inadequate force of 40 to 50 men, were left to occupy and keep order in the largest town (about 3,500) in Alta California\u2014Los Angeles. The Californio government officials had already fled Alta California.\n\nIn September 1846 the Californios  [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]], organized and led a campaign of resistance against the American incursion into Los Angeles of the prior month.  As a result, the outnumbered United States troops evacuated the city for the following few months.  Over the following four months, U.S. forces fought minor skirmishes with the Californio Lancers in the [[Battle of San Pasqual|Battle of San Pasqual (in San Diego, California)]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho|Battle of Dominguez Rancho (near Los Angeles)]], and the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|Battle of Rio San Gabriel (near Los Angeles)]]. After the Los Angeles resistance started, the American California Battalion was expanded to a force of about 400 men.\n\nIn early January 1847, a 600-man joint force of U.S. Marine, U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]]'s 80 [[U.S. Army]] dragoons (cavalrymen), who had arrived over the Gila river trail in December 1846, and about two companies of Fremont's California Battalion re-occupied Los Angeles after some very minor skirmishes (mostly posturing)\u2014four months after the initial American retreat, the same U.S. flag again flew over Los Angeles. The minor armed resistance in California ceased when the Californios signed the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847. About 150 Californios who were worried about possible punishment from the Americans for not keeping their non-aggression promises rounded up about 300 horses and retreated into Sonora, Mexico over the [[Yuma Crossing]] [[Gila River]] trail. The Californios, who had wrested control of California from Mexico in 1845, now had a new and much more stable government.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\">{{cite web|url=http://calrepublic.tripod.com/history.html|title=History of California including the Indians, Spanish, Californio, Bear Flag Republic, United States, and their flags.|website=Calrepublic.tripod.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed in early 1847, the [[Pacific Squadron]] then went on to capture all [[Baja California]] cities and harbors and sink or capture all the [[Pacific Naval Force|Mexican Pacific Navy]] they could find. Baja California was returned to Mexico in subsequent [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] negotiations. California was under U.S. control by January 1847 and formally annexed and paid for by the U.S. in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] signed in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|title=Home|website=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021135741/http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|archive-date=2012-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements arrive====\nAfter hostilities had ceased with the signing of the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847, on January 22, 1847 Commodore Stockton's replacement, Commodore William B. Shubrick, showed up in Monterey in the [[razee]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}} with 54 guns and about 500 crew members. On January 27, 1847 the transport ''Lexington'' showed up in Monterey, California with a regular [[U.S. Army]] [[artillery]] company of 113 men under Captain Christopher Tompkins.<ref>Harlow, Neal; ''California Conquered'', p. 247, University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\nMore reinforcements of about 320 soldiers (and a few women) of the [[Mormon Battalion]] arrived at [[San Diego]] on January 28, 1847\u2014after hostilities had ceased. They had been recruited from the [[Mormon]] camps on the [[Missouri River]]\u2014about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away. These troops were recruited with the understanding they would be discharged in California with their weapons. Most were discharged before July 1847. More reinforcements in the form of Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]]'s [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] of about 648 men showed up in March\u2013April 1847\u2014again after hostilities had ceased. After desertions and deaths in transit, four ships brought Stevenson's 648 men to California. Initially they took over all of the Pacific Squadron's on-shore military and garrison duties and the Mormon Battalion and California Battalion's garrison duties.\n\nThe New York Volunteer companies were deployed from San Francisco in Alta California to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]] in Baja California. The ship ''Isabella'' sailed from Philadelphia on 16 August 1847, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on 18 February 1848, the following year, at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers. These soldiers were added to the existing companies of Stevenson's [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]]. Stevenson's troops were recruited with the understanding that they would be discharged in California. When gold was discovered in late January 1848, many of Stevenson's troops deserted.\n\nThe U.S. 1850 California Census asks state of birth of all residents and finds about 7300 residents that were born in California. The San Francisco, Contra Costa and Santa Clara county U.S. censuses were lost or burned in one of San Francisco's many fires. Adding the approximate 200 Hispanics in San Francisco (1846 directory) and an unknown (but small as shown in 1852 CA Census recount) number of Hispanics in Contra Costa and Santa Clara county in 1846 gives less than 8,000 Hispanics statewide in 1846 before hostilities commenced. The number of California Indians is unknown since they were not included in the 1850 census but has been roughly estimated to be between 50,000 and 150,000.\n\n====Military governor====\nAfter 1847, California was controlled (with much difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor and an inadequate force of a little over 600 troops. By 1850, California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population of over 100,000 due to the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>U.S. 1850 California Census counts 92,597 residents but omits the residents of San Francisco (estimated at about 21,000) whose census records were destroyed by fire. Contra Costa County (estimated at about 2,000 residents) and Santa Clara County (estimated at about 4,000 residents) 1850 records were \"lost\" and also not included. The total non-Indian (Indians were not counted) population was over 120,000. See: \"Historical Statistical Abstracts - U.S. Census Bureau\"; [www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html]</ref> Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress on the number of slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough clout to choose its own boundaries, select its representatives, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other states.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] formally ended the Mexican\u2013American War in February 1848. For $15,000,000, and the assumption of U.S. debt claims against Mexico, the new state of Texas's boundary claims were settled, and [[New Mexico]], California, and the unsettled territory of several future states of the American Southwest were added to U.S. control.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1850, California had military governors appointed by the senior military commander in California. This arrangement was distinctly unsettling to the military, as they had no inclination, precedent, or training for setting up and running a government. President [[James K. Polk]] in office from March 4, 1845 \u2013 March 4, 1849, tried to get the 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress to agree on the specifics of how this was to be done\u2014the issue was the number of free states vs. slave states.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States.

Riley]] who had fought in the [[Siege of Veracruz]] and [[Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and considered an able military commander, was the last military governor of California in 1849\u20131850. In response to popular demand for a better more representative government, General Riley issued an official proclamation dated June 3, 1849, calling for a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] and an election of  representatives on August 1, 1849.\n[[File:Colton Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Colton Hall]] in Monterey, site of California's 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]]]]\n\n==== California Constitutional Convention (1849) ====\nConvention delegates were chosen by secret ballot but lacking any census data as to California's population and where they lived its representatives only roughly approximated the rapidly changing state population as later shown in the 1850 U.S. California Census taken a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 December 2004|title=Statistical Abstracts|date=29 December 2004|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> The 48 delegates chosen were mostly pre-1846 American settlers; eight were native born Californios who had to use interpreters.

After the election the [[Constitutional Convention (California)|California Constitution Convention]]  met in the small town and former Californio capital of [[Monterey, California]], in September 1849 to write a state constitution.<ref>Report of the debates in the Convention of California on the formation of  By California.

The 1849 Constitution<ref>Constitution of the State of California {{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/archives/collections/1849/full-text.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128022726/http://www.sos.ca.gov/archives/collections/1849/full-text.htm |archivedate=2010-01-28 }} Accessed 9 April 2011</ref> copied (with revisions) a lot out of the [[Ohio]] and New York Constitutions but had parts that were originally several different state constitutions as well as original material.\n\nThe 21-article ''Declaration of Rights'' in the [[California Constitution]] (Article I: Sec.1 to Sec.-21) was broader than the U.S. Constitution's 10-article ''[[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]''. There were four other significant differences from the U.S. Constitution. The [[California Constitution|convention]] chose the boundaries for the state\u2014unlike most other territories, whose boundaries were set by Congress (Article XII). Article IX encouraged statewide education and provided for a system of common schools partially funded by the state and provided for the establishment of a University (University of California). The California version outlawed slavery, except as punishment (Article I Sec. 18) and dueling (Article XI Sec.2) and gave women and wives the right to own and control their own property (Article XI Sec. 14).\n\nThe [[debt limit]] for the state was set at $300,000 (Article VIII). Like all other states they guaranteed the rights of citizens to sue in Civil court to uphold the rights of contracts and property (Article I Sec. 16). They created a court system with a supreme court with judges who had to be confirmed every 12 years.(Article VI) They set up the states original 29 counties (Article I Sec. 4), created a legislature of two houses, set up polling places to vote, set up uniform taxation rules. The 1849 Constitution guaranteed the right to vote to \"Every citizen of California, declared a legal voter by this Constitution, and every citizen of the United States, a resident of this State on the day of election, shall be entitled to vote at the first general election under this Constitution, and on the question of the adoption thereof (Article XII Sec. 5)\".<ref name=\"Richard B.

Soon after the election they set up a provisional state government that set up the counties, elected a governor, senators, and representatives, and operated for ten months setting up a state government before California was given official statehood by Congress on September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]].<ref name=\"Richard B.

There was a celebration that lasted for weeks. The state capital was variously at [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (1850\u20131851), [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] (1852\u20131853), and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] (1853\u20131854) until [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] was finally selected in 1854.\n\n====California Gold Rush (1848\u20131855)====\n{{Main|California Gold Rush}}\n\n[[File:California Gold Rush relief map 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|California goldfields in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[northern California]]]]\n\nThe first to hear confirmed information of the [[California Gold Rush]] were the people in [[History of Oregon|Oregon]], the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] (Hawaii), Mexico, [[Peru]], and [[Chile]]. They were the first to start flocking to the state in late 1848. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.<ref>Starr, Kevin and Richard J. Orsi (eds.)

Almost all (~96%) were young men. [[Women in the California Gold Rush]] were few and had many opportunities to do new things and take on new tasks. [[Argonauts]], as they were often called, walked over the [[California Trail]] or came by sea. About 80,000 Argonauts arrived in 1849 alone\u2014about 40,000 over the California trail and 40,000 by sea.\n\nSan Francisco was designated the official [[port of entry]] for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called [[tariffs]] and [[Ad valorem tax]]es) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods. The first Collector of customs was Edward H. Harrison, appointed by General Kearny. Shipping boomed from the average of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/inport/1849.htm|title=1849.

Passengers disembarking in San Francisco had one of the easier accesses to the gold country since they could take another ship from there to get to Sacramento and several other towns.\n\nSan Francisco shipping boomed, and wharves and piers had to be developed to handle the onslaught of cargo--''Long Wharf'' was probably the most prominent. To meet the demands of the Gold Rush, ships bearing food, liquors of many types, tools, hardware, clothing, complete houses, lumber, building materials, etc. as well as farmers, entrepreneurs, prospective miners, gamblers, entertainers and [[Women in the California Gold Rush|prostitutes]], etc. from around the world came to San Francisco.

The Californios initially prospered, as there was a sudden increase in the demand for livestock. These food shipments changed mainly to shipments from Oregon and internal shipments in California as agriculture was developed in both states.\n\nStarting in 1849, many of the ship crews jumped ship and headed for the gold fields when they reached port. Soon [[San Francisco Bay]] had many hundreds of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought ''cheap'' and hauled up on the mud flats and used as [[store ship]]s, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, and a number of other uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land. The population of San Francisco exploded from about 200 in 1846 to 36,000 in the 1852 California Census.<ref>San Francisco Population 794-2000 {{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco History - Population |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=2013-10-04 }} Accessed 4 April 2011</ref>\n\nIn San Francisco, many people were initially housed in wooden houses, ships hauled up on the mud flats to serve as homes or businesses, wood-framed canvas tents used for saloons, hotels and boarding houses as well as other flammable structures. All these canvas and wood structures, combined with a lot of drunken gamblers and miners, led almost inevitably to many fires. Most of San Francisco burned down six times in six ''Great Fires'' between 1849 and 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/fire.html|title=Early History of the San Francisco Fire Department|website=Sfmuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Merchant ships fill San Francisco harbor in 1850 or 1851]]\n\n''[[Californio]]s'' who lived in California had finally had enough of the Mexican government and seized control of the territory of [[Alta California]] in 1846.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\"/> At the time gold was discovered in 1848, California had about 9,000<ref>The 1850 U.S. Census of California found 7,600 people who claimed they were born in California (Californios).

Before the Gold Rush, almost no infrastructure existed in California except a few small [[Pueblos]] (towns), secularized and abandoned [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and about 500 large (averaging over {{convert|18000|acre|km2}})  [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] owned by the Californios who had mostly taken over the Missions land and livestock. The largest town in California prior to the Gold Rush was the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]] with about 3,500 residents.\n\nThe sudden massive influx into a remote area overwhelmed the state infrastructure, which in most places didn't even exist. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, wagons, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.<ref name=HollInfra>Holliday, J. S. (1999), p. 126.</ref> Wherever gold was discovered, hundreds of miners would collaborate to establish what a mining claim could be, put up a camp and stake their claims.

Ships could take this route year round and the first ships started leaving East Coast ports as early as November 1848. From the East Coast, a sailing voyage around the southern tip of South America would typically take five to eight months\u2014averaging about 200 days by standard [[sailing ship]].<ref name=BrandsCape>{{Cite book|last=Brands|first=H.

When the much faster [[clipper ship]]s began to be used starting in early 1849, they could complete this journey in an average of only 120 days; but they typically carried few passengers. They specialized in high value freight. Nearly all freight to California was carried by regular sailing vessels\u2014they were slow but the cheapest way to ship cargo. Starting about 1850 many travelers to California took steamboats to Panama or Nicaragua, crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] or Nicaragua and caught another steamboat to California. In California other smaller steamboats hauled miners from [[San Francisco, California]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. [[Marysville, California]] etc. This trip could be done in 40\u201360 days\u2014depending on connections. Returning miners and/or their gold nearly all reversed this route to return to the East Coast.\n\nThose who took the [[California Trail]] usually left [[Missouri River]] towns in early April and arrived in California 150\u2013170 days later\u2014late August or early September. Mostly, farmers etc. who lived in the Mid-west and already had wagons and teams took the California trail. Some winter wagon traffic came over the [[Gila River]] ([[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|De Anza Trail]]) and routes that included parts of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]]. About half the Argonauts to California came by wagon on one of these routes.\n\n====Gold Rush effects====\nStarting in 1848 before gold in California was even confirmed, Congress had contracted with the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] to set up regular [[paddle steamer]] [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular route from [[Panama]], [[Nicaragua]] and Mexico to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to and from the [[Chagres River]] in [[Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first steamship, the ''SS Falcon (1848')'' was dispatched on December 1, 1848. The [[SS California (1848)]], the first [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] [[steamship]], showed up in San Francisco loaded with gold seekers on February 28, 1849 on its first trip from Panama and Mexico after steaming around [[Cape Horn]] from [[History of New York (state)|New York]]. Once the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed, other paddle steamers soon followed on both the Pacific and Atlantic routes. By late 1849 [[paddle steamer]]s like the ''SS McKim (1848)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ships/ss.html|title=Page moved. Automatic redirect.|website=Maritimeheritage.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> were carrying miners and business men over the {{convert|125|mi|km}} trip from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[History of Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Marysville, California]]. Steam powered [[tugboat]]s started working in the [[San Francisco Bay]] soon after this.\n\nAgriculture expanded throughout the state to meet the food needs of the new settlers. Agriculture was soon found to be limited by the difficulty of finding enough water in the right places to grow irrigated crops. Winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring was one early crop that grew well without irrigation. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no written law regarding property rights in the goldfields, and a system of \"staking claims\" was developed by the miners. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were pushed off of traditional lands and massacred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/26/california-native-americans-genocide-490824.html|title=California's state-sanctioned genocide of Native Americans|date=17 August 2016|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> and [[gold mining]] caused environmental harm.\n\nIn the early years of the California Gold Rush, [[placer mining]] methods were used, from panning to \"cradles\" and \"rockers\" or \"long-toms\", to diverting the water from an entire river into a [[sluice]] alongside the river, and then digging for gold in the gravel down to the rocky river bottom. This placer gold had been freed by the slow disintegration, over geological time, that freed the gold from its ore. This free gold was typically found in the cracks in the rocks found at the bottom of the gravel found in rivers or creeks, as the gold typically worked down through the gravel or collected in stream bends or bottom cracks. Some 12-million ounces<ref>The [[Troy weight]] system is traditionally used to measure precious metals, not the more familiar [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois weight]] system. The term \"ounces\" of gold typically refers to troy ounces. There are some historical uses where, because of the age of the use, the intention is ambiguous.</ref> (370&nbsp;[[metric ton|t]]) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush. This gold greatly increased the available money in the United States, which was on the [[gold standard]] at that time\u2014the more gold you had, the more you could buy.\n\nAs the easier gold was recovered, the mining became much more capital and labor-intensive as the hard rock quartz mining, hydraulic mining, and dredging mining evolved. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11-million ounces (340&nbsp;t) of gold (worth approximately US$6.6&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices) had been recovered via \"hydraulicking,\" a style of [[hydraulic mining]] that later spread around the world, despite its drastic environmental consequences. By the late 1890s, [[dredging]] technology had become economical,<ref name=RawlsDredge>Rawls, James J. and Orsi, Richard (eds.) (1999), p. 199.</ref> and it is estimated that more than 20&nbsp;million ounces (620&nbsp;t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$12&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices). Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, hard-rock mining wound up being the single-largest source of gold produced in the [[Gold Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/ |title=Mercury Contamination from Historical Gold Mining in California |accessdate=2008-02-26 |author1=Charles N.

Hothem |work=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the [[U.S. Navy]] started making plans for a west coast navy base at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]]. The greatly increased population, along with the new wealth of gold, caused: roads, bridges, farms, mines, steamship lines, businesses, [[western saloon|saloons]], gambling houses, boarding houses, churches, schools, towns, mercury mines, and other components of a rich modern (1850) U.S. culture to be built. The sudden growth in population caused many more towns to be built throughout Northern, and later Southern, California and the few existing towns to be greatly expanded. The first cities started showing up as [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Sacramento|Sacramento]] exploded in population.\n\n====Effects on indigenous population====\nMost California Indians are thought to have been located near the coast, the same areas the Spanish Missions were established. Since California Indians had no agriculture before it was introduced by the [[Franciscan]] padres, they were strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] society tribes which could not support large populations\u2014large populations require agriculture. During the Spanish and Mexican California occupation period nearly all coastal tribes south of San Francisco were induced to join a mission. So many Mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions at the missions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women at the missions. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission Franciscan ''padres'' from 1800 to 1830 had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> If Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have slightly different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> After the missions were disbanded in 1832 the surviving Indians mostly went to work on the about 500 newly established [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] who appropriated the mission's \"property\" (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} acres/mission). The Indians typically worked  at one of the four Spanish pueblos as servants or at the newly established ranchos for room and board or attempted to join other tribes in the interior. The new ranchos occupied nearly all their original tribal territories.\n\nThe new wave of immigration that was sparked by the gold rush would continue to have a disastrous impact on California's native population, which continued to precipitously decline mainly due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |title=Destruction of the California Indians |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |archivedate=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Like when the [[Spanish missions in California]] were established the native inhabitants were often forcefully removed from their traditional tribal lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. There were a number of massacres, including the [[Yontoket massacre]], the [[Bloody Island massacre]] at Clear Lake, and the Old Shasta Massacre, in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the state of California paid around 1.5 million dollars (some $250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=California Militia and Expeditions Against the Indians, 1850 - 1859|website=Militarymuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> to hire \"militias\" whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. These \"private military forays\" were involved in several of the above-mentioned massacres, and sometimes participated in the \"wanton killing\" of Native peoples. The first governor of California, [[Peter Burnett]], openly called for the extermination of the Indian tribes, and in reference to the violence against California's Native population, he said, \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|title=INDIANS of CALIFORNIA - American Period|website=Cabrillo.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the rise of modern California equalled great tragedy and hardship for the native inhabitants.

Lincoln and London: Univ. of Nebraska Press, (1974).]</ref>\n\n====California in the American Civil War====\n{{Main|California in the American Civil War}}\n\nThe possibility of splitting off Southern California as a territory or a state was rejected by the national government, and the idea was dead by 1861 when patriotic fervor swept California after the attack on [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nCalifornia's involvement in the [[American Civil War]] included sending gold east, recruiting or funding a limited number of combat units, maintaining numerous fortifications and sending troops east, some of whom became famous. Following the split in the Democratic Party in 1860, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] supporters of Lincoln took control of the state in 1861, minimizing the influence of the large southern population. Their great success was in obtaining a Pacific railroad land grant and authorization to build the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] as the western half of the transcontinental railroad.\n\nCalifornia was settled primarily by [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] farmers, miners, and businessmen. Though the southerners and some Californios tended to favor the Confederacy, the state did not have slavery, and they were generally powerless during the war itself. They were prevented from organizing and their newspapers were closed down by denying them the use of the mail. Former Sen. [[William M. Gwin]], a Confederate sympathizer, was arrested and fled to Europe.\n\nNearly all of the men who volunteered as Union soldiers stayed in the West, within the [[Department of the Pacific]], to guard forts and other facilities, occupy secessionist regions, and fight Indians in the state and the western territories. Some 2,350 men in the [[California Column]] marched east across Arizona in 1862 to expel the Confederates from Arizona and New Mexico. The California Column then spent most of the remainder of the war fighting hostile Indians in the area.\n\n====Early California transportation====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] in 1821, the onerous Spanish rules in effect from 1770 to 1821 against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with essentially no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, nails, finished goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these [[Ranchos of California|California Ranchos]] were [[leather|cow hides]] (called California greenbacks), [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) and [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California/Texas longhorn cattle]] horns<ref>{{cite web | title=California Longhorns Vs. Texas Longhorns of Yesteryear and Today - A Comparative Study | author=Michael Casey | url=http://www.fairlealonghorns.com/Default.aspx?ID=566&Title=CaliforniavsTexasLonghorns | publisher=Fairlea Longhorns | accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in [[sailing ship]]s about {{convert|17000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] written about 1832 provides a good first hand account of this trade.,<ref name=\"Dana, Richard 2010\">Dana, Richard; ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea'' Republished by CreateSpace (2010)  {{ISBN|978-1-4564-7282-5}}</ref><ref>Google eBook [https://archive.org/details/twoyearsbeforem01smitgoog ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea''] accessed 9 February 2012</ref>\n\nFrom 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> The port of entry for trading purposes was the Alta California Capital, [[Monterey, California]], where custom duties ([[tariff]]s) of about 100% were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs (custom duties). In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs (also called Customs or [[ad valorem tax]]es), although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\"/>\n\nShips after 1848 provided easy, cheap, links among the coastal towns within California and on routes leading there. Nearly all cargo to California came by [[sailing ship]] until the completion of the [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. The sea route was more than {{convert|17000|mi|km}} route from the east coast or Europe around [[Cape Horn]] in [[South America]]. This route averaged about 200 days by \"standard\" [[sailing ship]] or about 120 days by [[Clipper]]. One of the main problems that occurred during the gold rush was the lack of a paying cargo for ships leaving California. Food, supplies and passengers were the main cargo coming to California; but there were only a limited return trade of returning passengers, mail and gold. Many of the sailing ships that arrived in [[San Francisco Bay]] were abandoned there or converted into warehouses or landfill.\n\nThe Panama and Nicaragua routes provided a shortcut for getting from the East Coast to California and a brisk maritime passenger trade developed, featuring fast [[paddle steamer]]s from cities on the east coast, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Havana]] Cuba to the Caribbean mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the mouth of [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. After a trip up the Chagres River by native dugouts the last {{convert|20|mi|km}} were completed to Panama City by mule back. The trip up the San Juan River in Nicaragua was usually done by small steam launch to [[Lake Nicaragua]], a boat trip on the lake and a final {{convert|25|mi|km}} trip by stage coach or mule back to [[San Juan del Sur]] or other city in the Pacific side of Nicaragua. After 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed the Nicaragua route largely shut down.\n\nIn 1846 the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled with [[Great Britain]] and California was under U.S. control in 1847 and annexed and paid for in 1848. The United States was now a Pacific Ocean power. Starting in 1848 the [[U.S. Congress]], after the annexation of California but before the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed there, had subsidized the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] with $199,999 to set up regular [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular scheduled route from [[Panama City]], Nicaragua and [[Mexico]] to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans]] to and from the mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in [[Isthmus of Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first [[paddle wheel]] steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail\u2014the [[Chagres River]].\n\nIn 1849 [[William H. Aspinwall]], the man who had won the bid for the building and operating of the Pacific mail steamships, conceived a plan to construct a railway across the [[isthmus of Panama]]; he and his partners created a company registered in New York, the [[Panama Railroad Company]], raised US$1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California or return home. [[Cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]] took a deadly toll on the Railroad workers, and despite the continual importation of large numbers of new workers, there were times when the work stalled for simple lack of alive and semi-fit workers. All railroad supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the [[Caribbean]] Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924021538214/page/n34 <!-- pg=21 -->  Fessenden Nott Otis, '''Isthmus of Panama: History of the Panama railroad; and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company''', Harper & Brothers, New York, 1867 pp. 21-36.]</ref> Upon completion in 1855 the road stretched {{convert|47|mi|km}} and had cost over $8,000,000 and about 5,000 lives. By 1855 this arduous trip across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] had been shortened to a one-day $25.00 excursion on the [[Panama Railroad]].\n\n[[File:SS California Poster Sharpened.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[SS California (1848)]]'', Pacific Mail's first ship on the [[Panama City]] to [[San Francisco]] route.]]\n\nThe first of three [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] [[paddle wheel]] steamships, the [[SS California (1848)]], contracted for on the Pacific route, left [[History of New York City|New York City]] on 6 October 1848. This was before the gold strikes in California were confirmed and she left with only a partial passenger load in her 60 saloon (about $300 fare) and 150 steerage (about $150 fare) passenger compartments. Only a few were going all the way to California.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990424163308/http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-04-24 | title=The Maritime Heritage Project Passenger Lists}}</ref> As word of the gold strikes spread, the {{SS|California|1848|6}} picked up more passengers in [[Valparaiso]] [[Chile]] and [[Panama City]] [[Panama]] and showed up in San Francisco on 28 February 1849. She was loaded with about 400 gold seeking passengers; twice the number of passengers it had been designed for. In San Francisco all her passengers and crew except the captain and one man deserted the ship and it would take the Captain two more months to gather a much better paid return crew to return to Panama city an establish the route they had been contracted for. Many more paddle steamers were soon running from the east coast cities to the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. By the mid 1850s there were over ten Pacific and ten Atlantic/Caribbean paddle wheel steamboats shuttling high valued freight like passengers, gold and mail between California and both the Pacific and Caribbean ports. The trip to the east coast could be executed after about 1850 in as short as 40 days if all ship connections could be met with a minimum of waiting.\n\nSteamboats plied the Bay Area and the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s that flowed nearer the goldfields, moving passengers and supplies from San Francisco to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Stockton, California]]\u2014the three main cities supplying the gold fields. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields in the foothills of the Sierra. Rough ways such as the Millerton Road which later became the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]<ref>Hoover and Kyle, p. 376</ref> quickly extended the length of the valley and were served by mule teams and covered wagons.<ref>{{cite web | last=Coate | first=Bill | title=Last blast from steamers on the San Joaquin | url=http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | publisher=Madera Tribune | date=March 16, 2003 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024843/http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> [[Riverboat]] navigation quickly became an important transportation link on the San Joaquin River, and during the \"June Rise\",<ref>Rose, p. 54</ref> as boat operators called the San Joaquin's annual high water levels during snow melt, on a wet year large craft could make it as far upstream as Fresno.

Soon a system of wagon roads, bridges, ferries and toll roads were set up many of them maintained by tolls collected from the users. Large freight wagons pulled by up to 10 mules replaced pack trains, and toll roads built and kept passable by the tolls made it easier to get to the mining camps, enabling express companies to deliver firewood, lumber, food, equipment, clothes, mail, packages, etc. to the miners. Later when communities developed in Nevada some steamboats were even used to haul cargo up the [[Colorado River]] as high as where [[Lake Mead]] in Nevada is today.\n\n[[File:Butterfield-Overland.gif|thumb|500px|''The stage routes from a Butterfield Overland Mail Company map.'']]\n\nThe '''[[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line''' <ref>Also known as the '''Oxbow Route''', the '''Butterfield Overland Stage''', or the '''Butterfield Stage'''</ref> was a [[stagecoach]] service  operating from 1857 to 1861 of over {{convert|2800|mi|km}}.

An [[Act of Congress]], approved March 2, 1861, discontinued this route and service ceased June 30, 1861. On the same date the central route from St. Joseph, Missouri, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[Carson City, Nevada]] and on to [[Placerville, California]], went into effect. From the end of Central Overland route in [[Carson City, Nevada]] they followed the Placerville Toll road route over Johnson Pass (now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Highway 50]]) to California since it was the fastest and only route that was then kept open in winter across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\">Root, ''The Overland Stage to California'', p. 42:</ref> The 1800 draft horses and mules, 250 coaches, etc., on the southern [[Gila River]] route Butterfield Stage route were pulled off and moved to the new route between [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] and [[Placerville, California]] along the existing [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail]]s to Salt Lake City and then through central Utah and Nevada.

By traveling day and night and using team changes about every {{convert|10|mile|km}} the stages could make the trip in about 28 days. News paper correspondents reported that they had a preview of \"hell\" when they took the trip.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\"/>\n\nOnce cargo was moved off the ocean and rivers it nearly always transported by horse or ox drawn wagons\u2014still true till about 1920. When there was not a wagon trail the cargo was shifted to mule pack trains or carried on the backs of the miners. Lumber to build new homes, sluice boxes, etc. was a crying need and food to feed the miners was needed even more. However, California has a lot of native timber and even as early as 1850 there were saw mills set up to turn some of this timber into lumber. Food was initially imported from any and all west coast ports from Hawaii, Oregon or Mexico where it could be obtained. The lumber and food were transported by ships that had initially carried gold rush passengers and in many cases abandoned in the bay and could usually be bought cheap. The many goods the gold miners needed for a \"modest\" 1850s lifestyle were nearly always hauled by horse, mule or ox drawn wagons. Wheat and timber were early products from Oregon and the [[Columbia River]] area that could be economically imported. Soon it was found that some types of spring wheat could be planted in the fall in California and the mild winter with its rains would allow good crops to be harvested in the spring without irrigation. Later. much of this wheat was exported to ports around the world, California finally had a return cargo for its many incoming ships. California in the 1890s became the foremost wheat producer in the U.S. but could not really compete on the east coast with the burgeoning wheat lands being brought into production in the midwest were much closer to their markets. Other crops in California were usually found to be much more profitable and California joined the rest of the nation in importing most of its wheat from farms in the midwest.\n\nThe year 1848 saw the close of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the beginning of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros']] greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good  first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to California which he took in 1834\u20135. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of ''Two Years Before the Mast'' is available at Gutenberg project.)<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4277?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana|website=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=7 November 2017|date=July 2003}}</ref> A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was no easy way to preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up\u2014the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the \"golden\" days of Hispanic California. The largely illiterate ranchero owners lost nearly all their land to a few bad years for cattle in the 1860s and the many mortgages they had taken out to finance a \"prosperous\" life style and could no longer pay back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/cattle.html|title=Monterey County Historical Society, Local History Pages--The California Cattle Boom, 1849-1862|website=Mchsmuseum.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.<ref>Hutchinson, W.

These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] stations (completed 24 October 1861). The Pony express terminated soon after the telegraph was established. This combination wagon-stagecoach-pony express-telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pony Express Trail map |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf|website=Fs.fed.us|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> From Salt Lake City, the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon-California-Oregon trail(s) to Omaha, Nebraska. After the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869, the telegraph lines along the railroad tracks became the main line, since the required relay stations, lines and telegraph operators were much easier to supply and maintain along the railroad. The telegraph lines that diverged from the railroad lines or significant population centers were largely abandoned.\n\nAfter the 1870s, stagecoaches provided the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns that were not connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and [[paddle wheel]] steamships connecting port cities. Freight wagons still hauled nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger [[Concord stagecoach]], but the cheaper, rougher \"mud wagons\" were also in general use. The [[Wells Fargo]] company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from rough unpaved roads, rough rides, un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired [[stagecoach]]es. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes\u2014a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture as they may be shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.\n\n====Railroads====\n[[File:East and West Shaking hands at the laying of last rail Union Pacific Railroad - Restoration.jpg|thumb|Workers drive in the [[golden spike]] on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], 1869]]\n{{Main|History of rail transportation in California}}\n\nCalifornia's first railroad was built from Sacramento to Folsom, California starting in February 1855.

The [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the Pacific end of the railroad, largely took over nearly all freight across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains in Northern California.

Each of these railroads controlled one (and Southern Pacific controlled two) of the transcontinental railroads which linked California with states farther East. The railroads moved freight and passengers in large quantities and allowed the state's economy and population to expand rapidly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBy the 1890s the construction of electric railroads had begun in California and by the early 20th century several systems existed to serve California's largest cities. The state's electric railroad systems included the [[San Diego Electric Railway]], Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system, the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], [[East Bay Electric Lines]] and the [[Key System|San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway]] and [[Interurban]] rail systems such as the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] were also constructed. By the 1920s, Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system was the largest electric railroad in the world.\n\n[[File:Amtrak Capitol Corridor.jpg|thumb|An Amtrak Capitol Corridor train passing through [[Santa Clara Station (California)|Santa Clara Station]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe expansion of American railroads peaked in the 1910s and during [[the Great Depression]] many railroads suffered financial difficulties which led to some railroad bankruptcies. [[World War II]] caused a surge in the use of California's railroads but with the government funded construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s and the expansion of the [[Airline#U.S. airline industry|U.S. airline industry]] passenger rail service declined dramatically.\n\nThe 1970s saw the end of private passenger railroads in California, the creation of a national passenger railroad ([[Amtrak]]) and the [[Bay Area]]'s opening of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] rail-system. In the 1980s and 1990s commuter railroads where established in the Bay Area ([[Caltrain]] and [[Altamont Corridor Express]]), Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]) and San Diego ([[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster]]) and [[light rail]] networks were built or expanded in most urban areas.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the expansion in usage of passenger rail service and in 2008 [[California Proposition 1A (2008)|voters approved]] plans for the construction of a [[California High-Speed Rail|high-speed rail network]].\n\n==History of California, 1900 to present==\n{{Main|History of California 1900 to present}}\nAfter 1900, California continued to grow rapidly and soon became an agricultural and industrial power.

It was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in [[Pre-Columbian era#North America|pre-Columbian North America]]. After contact with [[:Category:Spanish explorers of the Pacific|Spanish explorers]], most of the Native Americans died out from European diseases.\n\nAfter the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of 1769\u201370, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 [[Spanish missions in California|California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper) California]], beginning with the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Mission San Diego de Alcala]] near the location of the modern day city of San Diego, California. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). Two of the pueblos would eventually grow into the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. After Mexican Independence was won in 1821, California fell under the jurisdiction of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. Fearing the influence of the Roman Catholic church over their newly independent nation, the Mexican government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|closed all of the missions]] and nationalized the church's property. They left behind a small \"[[Californio]]\" (white Hispanic) population of several thousand families, with a few small military garrisons. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u201348, Mexico was forced to relinquish any claim to California to the United States. The unexpected discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 produced a spectacular [[California Gold Rush|gold rush in Northern California]], attracting hundreds of thousand of ambitious young men from around the world. Only a few struck it rich, and many returned home disappointed. Most appreciated the other economic opportunities in California, especially in agriculture, and brought their families to join them. California became the 31st US state in 1850 and played a small role in the American Civil War. Chinese immigrants increasingly came under attack from [[Nativism (politics)#United States|nativists]]; they were forced out of industry and agriculture and into [[Chinatown]]s in the larger cities. As gold petered out, California increasingly became a highly productive agricultural society. The coming of the railroads in 1869 linked its rich economy with the rest of the nation, and attracted a steady stream of migrants. In the late 19th century, Southern California, especially Los Angeles, started to grow rapidly.\n\n==History of California through 1899==\n{{main|History of California through 1899}}\n\n===Pre-contact period===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n[[File:Tikhanov - Balthazar Inhabitant of Northern California (1818).png|200px|thumb|''Balthazar, [[indigenous peoples of California|Inhabitant of Northern California]]'', painting by [[Mikhail Tikhanov]].]]\nDifferent tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] lived in the area that is now California for an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 years.

[[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the west coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]] was a peninsula,<ref>Gutierrez, Ramon A, and Richard J. Orsi, ''Contested Eden: California before the Gold Rush'', University of California Press,1998, {{ISBN|0-520-21273-8}}, p. 81-82</ref> but in spite of his discoveries the myth persisted in European circles that California was an [[Island of California|island]].\n\nRumors of fabulously wealthy cities located somewhere along the California coast, as well as a possible [[Northwest Passage]] that would provide a much shorter route to the [[Indies]], provided an incentive to explore further.\n\n====First European contact (1542)====\nThe first European to explore the California coast was [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] ({{lang-pt|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Cabrilho}}), working for Spain. He died in southern California in 1543. Cabrillo and his men found that there was essentially nothing for the Spanish to easily exploit in California, and located at the extreme limits of exploration and trade from Spain it would be left essentially unexplored and unsettled for the next 234 years.\n\nThe Cabrillo expedition depicted the Indigenous populations as living at a subsistence level, typically located in small [[rancheria]]s of extended family groups of [[Dunbar's number|100 to 150 people]].<ref name=\"fourdir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/california_cultures.htm|publisher=Four Directions Institute|title=California Indian Cultures|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> They had no apparent agriculture as understood by Europeans, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery; their tools were made out of wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stone, and antler. Some shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tules]] and/or mud.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/> The Cabrillo expedition did not see the far north of California, where on the coast and somewhat inland traditional architecture consists of rectangular redwood or cedar plank semisubterranean houses.\n\nTraditional clothing was minimal in the summer, with tanned deerhide and other animal leathers and furs and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Feathers were sewn into prayer pieces worn for ceremonies. Some tribes around [[Santa Barbara, California]] and the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]] were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast carved redwood [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] canoes.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/>\n\nThe staple foods then used by other Indigenous American tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without irrigation in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see [[Mediterranean climate]]). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, and the environmental management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico.<ref>Lightfoot, Kent and Otis Parrish (2009).

This tradition of landscape management through fire ecology maintained acorn groves and other food sources, which along with knowledge of migratory herds such as elk and anadromous runs of salmon in the rivers, supported villages, small tribes, and extended family groups.\n\nA dietary staple for most Indigenous populations in interior California was [[acorn]]s, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, soaked in water to leach out their [[tannin]], and cooked. The grinding holes worn into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429222224/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-04-29 | title=Virtual Tours}}</ref> The ground and leached acorn flour was usually cooked into a nutritious mush, eaten daily with other traditional foods. Acorn preparation was a very labor-intensive process nearly always done by women.

Local trade between Indigenous populations enabled them to acquire seasonings such as salt, or foodstuffs and other goods that might be rare in certain locales, such as flint or obsidian for making spear and arrow points. Native cultures in California are much different from other cultures of Indigenous populations in North America, and some have survived to the present day.\n\nCalifornia indigenous language diversity numbered 80 to 90 languages and dialects, some surviving to the present although endangered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|accessdate=25 February 2018|title=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523020014/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The high and rugged [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains located behind the [[Great Basin Desert]] east of California, extensive forests and mountains in the north, the rugged and harsh [[Sonoran Desert]] and [[Mojave Desert]] in the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west effectively isolated California from easy trade or tribal interactions with Indigenous populations on the rest of the continent, and delayed the tragedies and damages of colonial-settler arrival until the Spanish missions, the Gold Rush, and the Euro-American invasion of indigenous Californians' territories.\n\n====Spanish trading route (1565)====\nIn 1565 the Spanish developed a trading route where they took gold and silver from the Americas and traded it for goods and spices from China and other Asian areas. The Spanish set up their main base in the [[Philippines]]. The trade with Mexico involved using an annual passage of [[Manila galleon]](s). The Eastbound galleons first went north to about 40 degrees [[latitude]] and then turning East they could use the westerly [[trade wind]]s and currents. These galleons, after crossing most of the Pacific Ocean, would arrive off the California coast from 60 to over 120 days later somewhere near [[Cape Mendocino]] (about {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of San Francisco) at about 40 degrees N. latitude. They then could turn south down the California coast utilizing the available winds and the south flowing (about 1&nbsp;mi/hr (1.6&nbsp;km/h)) [[California Current]]. After sailing about {{convert|1500|mi|km|}} south on they eventually reached their home port in Mexico. [[San Francisco Bay]] escaped discovery for two centuries until it was finally discovered by land exploration in 1769.\n\n====Francis Drake's claim (1579)====\n[[File:Sir Francis Drake Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach, Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California.JPG|thumb|Francis Drake \"Nova Albion\" Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach]]\nThe English explorer and [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]] sailed south along the coast of northern California in 1579 after capturing two Spanish treasure ships in the Pacific. It is believed Drake put ashore somewhere north of San Francisco, where the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' underwent extensive repairs and accumulated needed supplies for a trip across the Pacific. Leaving California, he completed the second recorded [[circumnavigation]] of the world (after [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) in 1580.\n\nThe exact location of Drake's port is still undetermined, but a prominent bay on the California coast, [[Drakes Bay]], bears his name. He claimed all the land south of 42 degrees latitude, north of the imprecise Spanish claims and eastward from coast to coast for England, calling it [[Nova Albion]]. The term \"Nova Albion\" was often used on European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish claims. Spanish maps, explorations etc., of this and later eras were generally not published, being regarded as state secrets. As was typical in this era, there were conflicting claims to the same territory, and the indigenous peoples who lived there were never consulted.\n\nIn 1602, sixty years after Cabrillo, the Spaniard [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]] explored California's coastline from San Diego as far north as [[Monterey Bay]]. He named [[San Diego Bay]].  He also put ashore in [[Monterey, California]] and made glowing reports of the Monterey bay area as a possible anchorage for ships with land suitable for growing crops. He also provided rudimentary charts of the coastal waters, which were used for nearly 200 years.\n\n===Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)===\n[[File:Misi\u00f3n Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur]], was founded in 1697.]]\n\n{{anchor|Spanishsettlement}}The Spanish divided California into two parts, [[Baja California]] and [[Alta California]], as provinces of [[New Spain]] (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the [[Baja Peninsula]] and terminated roughly at [[San Diego, California]] where Alta California started. The eastern and northern boundaries of Alta California were very indefinite, as the Spanish, despite a lack of physical presence and settlements, claimed essentially everything in what is now the western United States.\n\nThe first permanent [[Spanish missions in Baja California|mission]] in Baja California, [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], was founded  on October 15, 1697, by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Juan Maria Salvatierra]] (1648\u20131717) accompanied by one small boat's crew and six soldiers. After the establishment of Missions in Alta California after 1769, the Spanish treated Baja California and Alta California as a single administrative unit, part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], with [[Monterey, California]], as its capital.\n\nNearly all the missions in Baja California were established by members of the [[Jesuit]] order supported by a few soldiers. After a power dispute between [[Charles III of Spain]] and the Jesuits, the Jesuit colleges were closed and the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuits were expelled]] from Mexico and South America in 1767 and deported back to Spain. After the forcible expulsion of the Jesuit order, most of the missions were taken over by [[Franciscan]] and later [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars. Both of these groups were under much more direct control of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. This reorganization left many missions abandoned in Sonora Mexico and Baja California.\n\n[[File:Map of California as an island R.W. Seale 1745.jpg|thumb|This 1745 map by British cartographer R.W. Seale misrepresented California as an island.]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France and their allies (called the [[French and Indian War]] in the British colonies on the East Coast)  (1754\u20131763), France was driven out of North America. Spain and Britain were the only colonial powers left. Britain, as yet, had no Pacific colonies in North America. The Bourbon King [[Charles III of Spain]] established [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and other outposts in [[Alta California]] out of fear that the territory would be claimed by the British, who not only had 13 colonies on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], but also several islands in the Caribbean, and had recently taken over [[Canada under British rule (1763\u20131867)|Canada]] from the French.\n\nOne of Spain's gains from the Seven Years' War was the French [[Louisiana Territory]] which was secretly given to Spain. Another potential colonial power already established in the Pacific was Russia, whose [[Maritime Fur Trade]] of mostly sea otter and fur seals was pressing down from Alaska to the [[Pacific Northwest]]'s lower reaches. These furs could be traded in China for large profits.\n\nThe Spanish settlement of Alta California was the last colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, and they tried to do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately half the cost of settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Pueblo Revolt]] among the [[Pueblo Indians]] of the [[Rio Grande]] valley in the 1680s as well as [[Pima Indian Revolt]] in 1751 and the ongoing [[Seri people|Seri]] conflicts in [[Sonora Mexico]] provided the [[Franciscan]] friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.<ref>Starr, Kevin. ''California: A History''. New York: Modern Library (2005), Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nThe remoteness and isolation of California, the lack of large organized tribes, the lack of agricultural traditions, the absence of any domesticated animals larger than a dog, and a food supply consisting primarily of acorns (unpalatable to most Europeans) meant the missions in California would be very difficult to establish and sustain and made the area unattractive to most potential colonists. A few soldiers and friars financed by the Church and State would form the backbone of the proposed settlement of California.\n\n====Portol\u00e1 expedition (1769\u20131770)====\nIn 1769, the Spanish Visitor General, [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], planned a [[Portol\u00e0 expedition|five part expedition]], consisting of three units by sea and two by land, to start settling Alta California. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] volunteered to command the expedition. The Catholic Church was represented by [[Franciscan]] friar [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and his fellow friars. All five detachments of soldiers, friars and future colonists were to meet on the shores of San Diego Bay. The first ship, the ''San Carlos'', sailed from [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] on January 10, 1769, and the ''San Antonio'' sailed on February 15. The ''San Antonio'' arrived in San Diego Bay on April 11 and the ''San Carlos'' on April 29. The third vessel, the ''San Jos\u00e9'', left [[New Spain]] later that spring but was lost at sea with no survivors.\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Californias.svg|thumb|155px|Spanish colonial coat of arms for [[the Californias]].]]\n\nThe first land party, led by [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]], left from the Franciscan [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1|Mission San Fernando Velicata]] on March 24, 1769.

That group arrived in San Diego on May 4. A later expedition led by Portol\u00e0, which included Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the President of the Missions, along with a combination of missionaries, settlers, and leather-jacket soldiers including [[Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Carrillo]], left Velicata on May 15, 1769 and arrived in San Diego on June 29.<ref name=\"Rivera's explorations\">{{cite web|url=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/havnar/documents/ortega/riveramo.html|title=Rivera's explorations|website=Pages.sbcglobal.net|accessdate=7 November 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThey took with them about 46 mules, 200 cows and 140 horses\u2014all that could be spared by the poor Baja Missions. [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando de Rivera]] was appointed to command the lead party that would scout out a land route and blaze a trail to San Diego.<ref name=\"Rivera's explorations\"/> Food was short, and the Indians accompanying them  were expected to forage for most of what they needed. Many Indian neophytes died along the way; even more deserted. The two groups traveling from Lower California on foot had to cross about {{convert|300|mi|km}} of the very dry and rugged [[Baja Peninsula]].\n\nThe part of the expedition that took place over land took about 40\u201351 days to get to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing [[California Current]] and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from [[scurvy]], and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the [[San Diego Presidio|Presidio of San Diego]] on May 14, 1769. [[Mission San Diego de Alcala]] was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).\n\nOn July 14, 1769, an expedition was dispatched from San Diego to find the port of Monterey. Not recognizing the [[Monterey Bay]] from the description written by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]]  almost 200 years prior, the expedition traveled beyond it to what is now the [[San Francisco, California]] area. The exploration party, led by Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]], arrived on November 2, 1769, at [[San Francisco Bay]].,<ref name=\"Portola\">{{cite web|title=Visitors: San Francisco Historical Information |url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |date=n.d. |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=City and County of San Francisco |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331220353/http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |archivedate=2008-03-31 }}</ref> One of the greatest ports on the west coast of America had finally been discovered by land.

They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then no understanding of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portol\u00e1 sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions in February to obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.\n\nFewer mouths to feed temporarily eased the drain on San Diego's scant provisions, but within weeks, acute hunger and increased sickness (scurvy) again threatened to force abandonment of the San Diego \"Mission\". Portol\u00e1 finally decided that if no relief ship arrived by March 19, 1770 they would leave to return to the \"[[New Spain]]\" missions on the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja Peninsula]] the next morning ''\"because there were not enough provisions to wait longer and the men had not come to perish from hunger.\"'' At three o'clock in the afternoon on March 19, 1770, as if by a miracle, the sails of the [[sailing ship]]  ''San Antonio'', loaded with relief supplies, were discernible on the horizon. The Spanish settlement of Alta California would continue.\n\n[[File:Juba map.jpg|thumb|Map of the route, Juan Bautista de Anza travelled in 1775-76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco via the Gila River corridor and the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River.]] [[File:Mojave-sonoran deserts.png|thumb|Mojave and Sonoran deserts block easy land travel to California.

They went across the Sonoran desert to California from Mexico by swinging south of the [[Gila River]] to avoid [[Apache]] attacks until they hit the [[Colorado River]] at the [[Yuma Crossing]]\u2014about the only way across the Colorado River. The friendly [[Quechan]] (Yuma) Indians (2-3,000) he encountered there were growing most of their food, using irrigation systems, and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\">Guerro, Vladimir; ''The Anza Trail: The Settling of California''; Heyday Books; (2006); {{ISBN|978-1-59714-026-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable [[Algodones Dunes]] west of [[Yuma, Arizona]], they followed the river about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south (to about the Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River)  before turning northwest to about today's [[Mexicali, Mexico]] and then turning north through today's [[Imperial Valley]] and then northwest again before reaching [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] near the future city of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It took Anza about 74 days to do this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California. On his return trip he went down the [[Gila River]] until hitting the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)]] and continuing on to Tubac. The return trip only took 23 days, and he encountered several peaceful and  populous agricultural tribes with irrigation systems located along the Gila River.<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\"/>\n\nIn Anza's second trip (1775\u20131776) he returned  to California with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows with them. The approximately 200 surviving cattle and an unknown number of horses (many of each were lost or eaten along the way) started the cattle and horse raising industry in California. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years. They essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. The party started from Tubac, Arizona, on October 22, 1775 and arrived at [[San Francisco Bay]] on March 28, 1776. There they established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], followed by a [[mission (station)|mission]], [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) --the future city of [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Crossing: [[Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er]] and [[Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. On July 17\u201318, 1781 the Yuma ([[Quechan]]) Indians, in a dispute with the Spanish, destroyed both missions and pueblos\u2014killing 103 soldiers, colonists, and Friars and capturing about 80 prisoners, mostly women and children. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners, but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The [[Yuma Crossing]] was closed for Spanish traffic and it would stay closed until about 1846. California was nearly isolated again from land based travel. About the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. The average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824 meant that additional colonists coming to Alta California were few and far between.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hb75yap6.htm|title=San Francisco History - Seventy-five Years in San Francisco, Appendix N.

The missions were nearly all located within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast and almost no exploration or settlements were made in the [[Central Valley (California)]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (California)]]. The only expeditions anywhere close to the Central Valley and Sierras were the rare forays by soldiers undertaken to recover runaway Indians who had escaped from the Missions. The \"settled\" territory of about 15,000 square miles (40,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was about 10% of California's eventual 156,000 square miles (400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) territory.\n\nIn 1786, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de La P\u00e9rouse]] led a group of scientists and artists who compiled an account of the Californian mission system, the land, and the people. Traders, whalers, and scientific missions followed in the next decades.\n\n====California Mission network====\nThe [[California Missions]], after they were all established, were located about one day's horseback ride apart for easier communication and linked by the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real trail]]. These Missions were typically manned by two to three friars and three to ten soldiers. Virtually all the physical work was done by  indigenous people convinced to or coerced into joining the missions. The padres provided instructions for making adobe bricks, building mission buildings, planting fields, digging irrigation ditches, growing new grains and vegetables, herding cattle and horses, singing, speaking Spanish, and understanding the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith\u2014all that was thought to be necessary to bring the Indians to be able to support themselves and their new church.\n\nThe soldiers supervised the construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, if they tried to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] observed that Indians were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking [[Californio]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dana |first=Richard Henry |authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. |title=Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea |publisher=Harper & Brothers |year=1842 |location=New York |pages=93, 97, 209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission San Luis Rey de Francia courtyard.jpg|thumb|250px|The courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, with California's oldest pepper tree (''[[Peruvian pepper|Schinus molle]]''), planted in 1830, visible through the arch.<ref>Young, p. 18</ref>]]\n\nThe missions eventually claimed about 1/6 of the available land in California or roughly {{convert|1000000|acre|km2|0}} of land per mission. The rest of the land was considered the property of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. To encourage settlement of the territory, large land grants were given to retired soldiers and colonists. Most grants were virtually free and typically went to friends and relatives in the California government. A few foreign colonists were accepted if they accepted Spanish citizenship and joined the Catholic Faith. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was still in nearly full force and forbade Protestants living in Mexican controlled territory. In the Spanish colonial period many of these grants were later turned into [[Ranchos of California|Ranchos]].\n\nSpain made about 30 of these large grants, nearly all several square leagues (1 Spanish league = {{convert|2.6|mi|km}}) each in size. The total land granted to settlers in the Spanish colonial era was about {{convert|800000|acre|km2|0}} or about {{convert|35000|acre|km2|0}} each. The few owners of these large ranchos patterned themselves after the landed gentry in Spain and were devoted to keeping themselves living in a grand style. The rest of the population they expected to support them. Their mostly unpaid workers were nearly all Spanish trained Indians or [[peons]] that had learned how to ride horses and raise some crops. The majority of the ranch hands were paid with room and board, rough clothing, rough housing and no salary.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were cattle, horses and sheep, most of which lived virtually wild. The cattle were mostly killed for fresh meat, as well as hides and tallow (fat) which could be traded or sold for money or goods. As the [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|cattle]] herds increased there came a time when nearly everything that could be made of leather was\u2014doors, window coverings, stools, [[chaps]], leggings, vests lariats ([[riata]])s, [[saddle]]s, boots  etc. Since there was no refrigeration then, often a cow was killed for the day's fresh meat and the hide and tallow salvaged for sale later. After taking the cattle's hide and tallow their carcasses were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which roamed wild in California at that time, or to feed the packs of dogs that typically lived at each rancho.\n\nA series of four ''presidios'', or \"royal forts\", each manned by 10 to 100 men, were built by Spain in Alta California. California installations were established in [[San Diego]] ([[Presidio of San Diego|El Presidio Real de San Diego]]) founded in 1769, in San Francisco ([[Presidio of San Francisco|El Presidio Real de San Francisco]]) founded in 1776, and in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] ([[Presidio of Santa Barbara|El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara]]) founded in 1782. After the Spanish colonial era the [[Presidio of Sonoma]] in [[Sonoma, California]] was founded in 1834.<ref>(For the [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] Census of 1790 listing the inhabitants of Monterey and the other presidios and pueblos, see [http://sfgenealogy.com/spanish/cen1790.htm The Census of 1790, California], California Spanish Genealogy.

The pueblos of [[History of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[History of San Diego|San Diego]], [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]], [[History of Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Villa de Branciforte]] (later abandoned before later becoming [[Santa Cruz, California]]) and the pueblo of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose, California]] were all established to support the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and presidios in California. These were the only towns (pueblos) in California.\n\n===Mexican period (1821 to 1846)===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|230px|[[First Mexican Republic|Mexico]] in 1824. [[Alta California]] is the northwestern-most country.]]\n\nIn 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Alta California became a territory rather than a full state. The territorial capital remained in [[Monterey, California]], with a governor as executive official.\n\nMexico, after independence, was unstable with about [[List of heads of state of Mexico|40 changes of government]], in the 27 years prior to 1848\u2014an average government duration was 7.9 months. In Alta California, Mexico inherited a large, sparsely settled, poor, backwater province paying little or no net tax revenue to the Mexican state. In addition, Alta California had a declining Mission system as the [[Spanish Missions of California|Mission]] Indian population in Alta California continued to rapidly decrease.\n\nThe number of Alta California settlers, always a minority of total population, slowly increased mostly by more births than deaths in the Californio population in California. After the closure of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|de Anza Trail]] across the [[Colorado River]] in 1781 immigration from Mexico was nearly all by ship. California continued to be a sparsely populated and isolated country.\n\n====Trade policy====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] the onerous Spanish rules against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet could not enforce their no-trading policies. The settlers, and their descendants (who became known as [[Californio]]s), were eager to trade for new commodities, finished goods, luxury goods, and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, a number of Europeans and Americans became naturalized Mexican citizens and settled in early California. Some of those became rancheros and traders during the Mexican period, such as [[Abel Stearns]].\n\n[[California hide trade|Cattle hides and tallow]], along with [[North American fur trade|marine mammal fur]] and other goods, provided the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian [[California hide trade|trading ships]] first appeared in California a few years before 1820. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] provides a good first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nThe main [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|port of entry]] for trading purposes was Monterey, where custom duties of up to 100% (also called [[tariffs]]) were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs. In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs, although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\">{{cite web|url=http://usgovernmentrevenue.com/index.php?year=1850#usgs302a|title=US Government Revenue, Deficit and Debt - Numbers Charts Analysis History|website=usgovernmentrevenue.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico and the mission system====\nSo many mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women. This increase in deaths was accompanied by a very low live birth rate among the surviving Indian population. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission [[Franciscan]] ''padres'' had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\">Krell, Dorothy (ed.) (1979). ''The California Missions: A Pictorial History''; p. 316; Sunset Publishing Corporation, Menlo Park, California. {{ISBN|0-376-05172-8}}</ref>\n\nIf Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have very different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/>\n\nThe missions, as originally envisioned, were to last only about ten years before being converted to ''regular'' parishes. When the California missions were abolished in 1834 some [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] had existed over 66 years but the [[Spanish missions in California|Mission]] Indians were still not self-sufficient, proficient in Spanish, or wholly Catholic. Taking people from a hunter-gatherer type existence to an educated, agricultural-based existence was much more difficult than the missionaries had originally thought. The severe and continuing decline in Mission Indian populations exacerbated this problem. In 1834 Mexico, in response to demands that the Catholic Church give up much of the Mission property, started the process of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularizing]] the [[Franciscan]] run [[Spanish missions in California|missions]]. [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834 Governor Figueroa issued his \"Decree of Confiscation.\"<ref>Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M. (1922); ''San Juan Capistrano Mission'', p. 114, Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, California</ref>\n\nNine other missions quickly followed, with six more in 1835; [[Mission San Buenaventura|San Buenaventura]] and San Francisco de As\u00eds were among the last to succumb, in June and December 1836, respectively.<ref>Yenne, Bill (2004). ''The Missions of California'', pp. 83, 93, Advantage Publishers Group, San Diego, California. {{ISBN|1-59223-319-8}}</ref> The [[Franciscan]]s soon thereafter abandoned most of the missions, taking with them almost everything of value they could, after which the locals typically plundered the mission buildings for construction materials, furniture, etc. or the mission buildings were sold off to serve other uses.\n\nIn spite of this neglect, the Indian towns at [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Dieguito Complex|San Dieguito]], and [[Las Flores Estancia|Las Flores]] did continue on for some time under a provision in Governor Echeand\u00eda's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the partial conversion of missions to new ''pueblos''.<ref>Robinson, W.W. (1948); ''Land in California'', p. 42, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California</ref> After the secularizing of the Missions, many of the surviving Mission Indians switched from being unpaid workers for the missions to unpaid laborers and vaqueros (cowboys) of the about 500 large Californio owned [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]].\n\n====Land grants====\nBefore Alta California became a part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]] to Presidio soldiers and government officials and a few friends and family of the Alta California Governors, some of whom were grandchildren of the original 1775 Anza expedition settlers. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Franciscan missions, while paving the way for additional settlers to California by making land grants easier to obtain.\n\nWhen the missions were secularized, the mission property and cattle were supposed to be mostly allocated to the missions Indians. In practice, nearly all mission property and livestock were taken over by the about 455 large [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] granted by the governors\u2014mostly to friends and family at low or no cost. The rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all distributed on former mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast.\n\nThe Mexican land grants were provisional until settled and worked on for five years, and often had very  indefinite boundaries and sometimes conflicting ownership claims. The boundaries of each rancho were almost never surveyed, and marked, and often depended on local landmarks that often changed over time. Since the government depended on import tariffs for its income, there was virtually no property tax\u2014the property tax when introduced with U.S. statehood was a big shock. The grantee could not subdivide, or rent out, the land without approval.\n\nThe rancho owners tried to live in a grand manner, and the result was similar to a [[feudal barony|barony]]. For these few rancho owners and families, this was  California's Golden Age; for the vast majority it was not golden. Much of the agriculture, vineyards, and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining Mission Indian population required less food, and the Missionaries and soldiers supporting the Missions disappeared. The new Ranchos and slowly increasing Pueblos mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade with the occasional trading ship or [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh vegetables.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were [[leather|cattle hides]] (called California greenbacks) and [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled {{convert|14000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides and tallow. The cattle and horses that provided the hides and tallow essentially grew wild.\n\nBy 1845, the province of Alta California had a non-native population of about 1,500 Spanish and Latin American-born adult men along with about 6,500 women and their native-born children (who became the Californios). These Spanish-speakers lived mostly in the southern half of the state from San Diego north to Santa Barbara.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There were also around 1300 American immigrants and 500 European immigrants from a wide variety of backgrounds. Nearly all of these were adult males and a majority lived in central and northern California from Monterey north to Sonoma and east to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA large non-coastal land grant was given to [[John Sutter]] who, in 1839, settled a large land grant close to the future city of [[Sacramento, California]], which he called \"[[New Helvetia]]\" (''New Switzerland''). There, he built an extensive fort equipped with much of the armament from [[Fort Ross]]\u2014bought from the Russians on credit when they abandoned that fort. [[Sutter's Fort]] was the first non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community in the California [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. Sutter's Fort, from 1839 to about 1848, was a major agricultural and trade colony in California, often welcoming and assisting [[California Trail]] travelers to California. Most of the settlers at, or near, Sutter's Fort were new immigrants from the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055153/http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-05-08 | title=John Sutter, Sutters Fort}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485|title=Sutter''s Fort SHP|first=California State Parks, State of|last=California|website=CA State Parks|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n====Annexation of California (1846\u20131847)====\n{{main|Conquest of California|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n<!--As I commented at the new article \"Conquest of California\", I have a problem with this wording. \"Conquest of California\" seems very non-neutral.

Several battles between U.S. and Mexican troops led the United States Congress to issue a declaration of war against Mexico on May 13, 1846; the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] had begun. Word of the conflict reached Alta California about a month later.\n\nThe main forces available to the United States in California were the bluejacket sailors and U.S. Marines on board the ships of the [[Pacific Squadron]]. Speculating that war with Mexico over Texas and other land was very possible, the [[U.S. Navy]] had sent several additional naval vessels to the Pacific in 1845 to protect U.S. interests there. It took about 200 days, on average, for ships to travel the greater than {{convert|17000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip from the East coast around [[Cape Horn]] of South America to California.\n\nInitially as the war with Mexico started there were five vessels in the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron near California. In 1846 and 1847 this was increased to 13 Navy vessels\u2014over half the U.S. Navy's available ships. The only other U.S. military force then in California was the about 30 military topographers etc. and 30 mountain men, guides, hunters, etc. in Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] exploratory force. They were exiting California on their way to what is now [[Oregon]] when they got word in early June 1846 that war was imminent and a revolt had already started in [[Sonoma, California]]. Hearing rumors of possible Californio military action against the newly arrived settlers in California (this had already happened in 1840),<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''A History of California'', The Macmillan Company 1922, p. 191 (Google eBook)</ref> some settlers decided to neutralize the small Californio garrison at Sonoma, California. On June 15, 1846, some thirty settlers, mostly American citizens, staged a revolt and seized the small Californio garrison, in Sonoma, without firing a shot and declared the new [[California Republic]] government. On hearing of this revolt, Fremont and his exploratory force returned to California. The \"republic\" never exercised any real authority and only lasted 26 days before accepting U.S. government control.\n\nThe former fleet surgeon William M. Wood and  John Parrot, the American Consul of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], arrived in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico on May 10, 1846. There they heard word of the ongoing hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico forces and sent a message by special courier back to Commodore ([[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]]) [[John D. Sloat]], commander of the [[Pacific Squadron]] then visiting Mazatl\u00e1n Mexico. On May 17, 1846, this courier's  messages informed Commodore Sloat that hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico had commenced.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846\u20131848, p. 201, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref>\n\nCommodore (Rear Admiral) John D.

The Mexican government by 1846 had already had 40 [[List of heads of state of Mexico|presidents]] in the first 24 years of its existence. Most new settlers and Californios were neutral or actively supported the revolt. An independent group of men called \"Los Osos\" raised the \"[[Bear Flag]]\" of the [[California Republic]] over Sonoma. The republic was in existence scarcely more than 25 days before Fr\u00e9mont returned and took over on June 23 from [[William B. Ide]] the leader of the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. The California state flag of today is based on this original Bear Flag and still contains the words \"California Republic.\"[[John A. Sutter]] and his men and supplies at Sutter's Fort joined the revolt.\n\n====US capture of coastal ports and towns====\nIn 1846, the U.S. Navy was under orders to take over all California ports in the event of war. There were about 400 to 500 [[U.S. Marines]] and U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors available for possible land action on the Pacific Squadron's ships. Hearing word of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma, California, and the arrival of the large British 2,600-ton, 600-man man-of-war {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}} flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, outside Monterey Harbor, Commodore Sloat was finally stirred to action. On July 7, 1846, seven weeks after war had been declared, Sloat instructed the captains of the ships {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} and [[sloops-of-war|sloops]] {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} of the [[Pacific Squadron]] in [[Monterey Bay]] to occupy [[Battle of Monterey|Monterey, California]]\u2014the Alta California capital. Fifty American marines and about 100 bluejacket sailors landed and captured the city without incident\u2014the few Californio troops formerly there having already evacuated the city. They raised the flag of the United States without firing a shot. The only shots fired were a 21-gun salute to the new U.S. flag fired by each of the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846-1848, p. 252, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref> The British ships observed but took no action.\n\nThe abandoned [[Presidio]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) at San Francisco, then called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], were occupied without firing a shot on July 9, 1846, by U.S. marines and U.S. Navy sailors from the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}. Militia Captain [[Thomas Fallon]] led a small force of about 22 men from [[Santa Cruz, California]], and captured the small town of [[History of San Jose, California|Pueblo de San Jose]] without bloodshed on July 11, 1846. Fallon received an American flag from Commodore John D. Sloat and raised it over the pueblo on July 14. On July 15, 1846, Commodore ([[Rear Admiral]]) Sloat transferred his command of the Pacific Squadron to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] when Stockton's ship, the frigate {{USS|Congress|1841|6}}, arrived from the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] (Hawaii).\n\nStockton, a much more aggressive leader, asked Fremont to form a joint force of Fremont's soldiers, scouts, guides, and others, and a volunteer militia\u2014many who were former Bear Flag Revolters. This unit, called the [[California Battalion]], was mustered into U.S. service and were paid regular army wages. On July 19, Fr\u00e9mont's newly formed \"California Battalion\" swelled to about 160 men. These men included Fremont's 30 topographical men and their 30 scouts and hunters, U.S. Marine Lieutenant [[Archibald H. Gillespie]], a U.S. Navy officer to handle their two [[cannon]]s, a company of Indians trained by Sutter and many other ''permanent'' California settlers from several different countries as well as American settlers. The California Battalion members were used mainly to garrison and keep order in the rapidly surrendering California towns.\n\nThe Navy went down the coast from San Francisco, occupying ports without resistance as they went. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of San Diego|San Diego]] surrendered 29 July 1846 without a shot being fired. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] surrendered without a shot being fired in August 1846.\n\n====Taking of Los Angeles====\nOn August 13, 1846, a joint force of U.S. Marines, bluejacket sailors and parts of Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion carried by the {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, California with flags flying and band playing. USMC Captain Archibald H. Gillespie, (Fr\u00e9mont's second in command of the [[California Battalion]]), with an inadequate force of 40 to 50 men, were left to occupy and keep order in the largest town (about 3,500) in Alta California\u2014Los Angeles. The Californio government officials had already fled Alta California.\n\nIn September 1846 the Californios  [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]], organized and led a campaign of resistance against the American incursion into Los Angeles of the prior month.  As a result, the outnumbered United States troops evacuated the city for the following few months.  Over the following four months, U.S. forces fought minor skirmishes with the Californio Lancers in the [[Battle of San Pasqual|Battle of San Pasqual (in San Diego, California)]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho|Battle of Dominguez Rancho (near Los Angeles)]], and the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|Battle of Rio San Gabriel (near Los Angeles)]]. After the Los Angeles resistance started, the American California Battalion was expanded to a force of about 400 men.\n\nIn early January 1847, a 600-man joint force of U.S. Marine, U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]]'s 80 [[U.S. Army]] dragoons (cavalrymen), who had arrived over the Gila river trail in December 1846, and about two companies of Fremont's California Battalion re-occupied Los Angeles after some very minor skirmishes (mostly posturing)\u2014four months after the initial American retreat, the same U.S. flag again flew over Los Angeles. The minor armed resistance in California ceased when the Californios signed the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847. About 150 Californios who were worried about possible punishment from the Americans for not keeping their non-aggression promises rounded up about 300 horses and retreated into Sonora, Mexico over the [[Yuma Crossing]] [[Gila River]] trail. The Californios, who had wrested control of California from Mexico in 1845, now had a new and much more stable government.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\">{{cite web|url=http://calrepublic.tripod.com/history.html|title=History of California including the Indians, Spanish, Californio, Bear Flag Republic, United States, and their flags.|website=Calrepublic.tripod.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed in early 1847, the [[Pacific Squadron]] then went on to capture all [[Baja California]] cities and harbors and sink or capture all the [[Pacific Naval Force|Mexican Pacific Navy]] they could find. Baja California was returned to Mexico in subsequent [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] negotiations. California was under U.S. control by January 1847 and formally annexed and paid for by the U.S. in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] signed in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|title=Home|website=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021135741/http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|archive-date=2012-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements arrive====\nAfter hostilities had ceased with the signing of the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847, on January 22, 1847 Commodore Stockton's replacement, Commodore William B. Shubrick, showed up in Monterey in the [[razee]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}} with 54 guns and about 500 crew members. On January 27, 1847 the transport ''Lexington'' showed up in Monterey, California with a regular [[U.S. Army]] [[artillery]] company of 113 men under Captain Christopher Tompkins.<ref>Harlow, Neal; ''California Conquered'', p. 247, University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\nMore reinforcements of about 320 soldiers (and a few women) of the [[Mormon Battalion]] arrived at [[San Diego]] on January 28, 1847\u2014after hostilities had ceased. They had been recruited from the [[Mormon]] camps on the [[Missouri River]]\u2014about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away. These troops were recruited with the understanding they would be discharged in California with their weapons. Most were discharged before July 1847. More reinforcements in the form of Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]]'s [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] of about 648 men showed up in March\u2013April 1847\u2014again after hostilities had ceased. After desertions and deaths in transit, four ships brought Stevenson's 648 men to California. Initially they took over all of the Pacific Squadron's on-shore military and garrison duties and the Mormon Battalion and California Battalion's garrison duties.\n\nThe New York Volunteer companies were deployed from San Francisco in Alta California to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]] in Baja California. The ship ''Isabella'' sailed from Philadelphia on 16 August 1847, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on 18 February 1848, the following year, at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers. These soldiers were added to the existing companies of Stevenson's [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]]. Stevenson's troops were recruited with the understanding that they would be discharged in California. When gold was discovered in late January 1848, many of Stevenson's troops deserted.\n\nThe U.S. 1850 California Census asks state of birth of all residents and finds about 7300 residents that were born in California. The San Francisco, Contra Costa and Santa Clara county U.S. censuses were lost or burned in one of San Francisco's many fires. Adding the approximate 200 Hispanics in San Francisco (1846 directory) and an unknown (but small as shown in 1852 CA Census recount) number of Hispanics in Contra Costa and Santa Clara county in 1846 gives less than 8,000 Hispanics statewide in 1846 before hostilities commenced. The number of California Indians is unknown since they were not included in the 1850 census but has been roughly estimated to be between 50,000 and 150,000.\n\n====Military governor====\nAfter 1847, California was controlled (with much difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor and an inadequate force of a little over 600 troops. By 1850, California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population of over 100,000 due to the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>U.S. 1850 California Census counts 92,597 residents but omits the residents of San Francisco (estimated at about 21,000) whose census records were destroyed by fire. Contra Costa County (estimated at about 2,000 residents) and Santa Clara County (estimated at about 4,000 residents) 1850 records were \"lost\" and also not included. The total non-Indian (Indians were not counted) population was over 120,000. See: \"Historical Statistical Abstracts - U.S. Census Bureau\"; [www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html]</ref> Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress on the number of slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough clout to choose its own boundaries, select its representatives, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other states.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] formally ended the Mexican\u2013American War in February 1848. For $15,000,000, and the assumption of U.S. debt claims against Mexico, the new state of Texas's boundary claims were settled, and [[New Mexico]], California, and the unsettled territory of several future states of the American Southwest were added to U.S. control.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1850, California had military governors appointed by the senior military commander in California. This arrangement was distinctly unsettling to the military, as they had no inclination, precedent, or training for setting up and running a government. President [[James K. Polk]] in office from March 4, 1845 \u2013 March 4, 1849, tried to get the 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress to agree on the specifics of how this was to be done\u2014the issue was the number of free states vs. slave states.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States.

Riley]] who had fought in the [[Siege of Veracruz]] and [[Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and considered an able military commander, was the last military governor of California in 1849\u20131850. In response to popular demand for a better more representative government, General Riley issued an official proclamation dated June 3, 1849, calling for a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] and an election of  representatives on August 1, 1849.\n[[File:Colton Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Colton Hall]] in Monterey, site of California's 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]]]]\n\n==== California Constitutional Convention (1849) ====\nConvention delegates were chosen by secret ballot but lacking any census data as to California's population and where they lived its representatives only roughly approximated the rapidly changing state population as later shown in the 1850 U.S. California Census taken a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 December 2004|title=Statistical Abstracts|date=29 December 2004|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> The 48 delegates chosen were mostly pre-1846 American settlers; eight were native born Californios who had to use interpreters.

There were four other significant differences from the U.S. Constitution. The [[California Constitution|convention]] chose the boundaries for the state\u2014unlike most other territories, whose boundaries were set by Congress (Article XII). Article IX encouraged statewide education and provided for a system of common schools partially funded by the state and provided for the establishment of a University (University of California). The California version outlawed slavery, except as punishment (Article I Sec. 18) and dueling (Article XI Sec.2) and gave women and wives the right to own and control their own property (Article XI Sec. 14).\n\nThe [[debt limit]] for the state was set at $300,000 (Article VIII). Like all other states they guaranteed the rights of citizens to sue in Civil court to uphold the rights of contracts and property (Article I Sec. 16). They created a court system with a supreme court with judges who had to be confirmed every 12 years.(Article VI) They set up the states original 29 counties (Article I Sec. 4), created a legislature of two houses, set up polling places to vote, set up uniform taxation rules. The 1849 Constitution guaranteed the right to vote to \"Every citizen of California, declared a legal voter by this Constitution, and every citizen of the United States, a resident of this State on the day of election, shall be entitled to vote at the first general election under this Constitution, and on the question of the adoption thereof (Article XII Sec. 5)\".<ref name=\"Richard B.

To meet the demands of the Gold Rush, ships bearing food, liquors of many types, tools, hardware, clothing, complete houses, lumber, building materials, etc. as well as farmers, entrepreneurs, prospective miners, gamblers, entertainers and [[Women in the California Gold Rush|prostitutes]], etc. from around the world came to San Francisco. These imports included large numbers of [[Galapagos tortoise]] and sea turtle imported into Alta California to feed the Gold miners.<ref name=\"Conrad and Pastron 2014\">{{cite journal|last1 = Conrad | first1 = Cyler | last2 = Pastron | first2 = Allen | year= 2014 | title=Galapagos Tortoises and Sea Turtles in Gold Rush-Era California |journal= California History | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=20\u201339| doi = 10.1525/ch.2014.91.2.20 }}</ref><ref name=\"Conrad et al. 2015\">{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Cyler | last2 = Gobalet | first2 = Kenneth W. | last3 = Bruner | first3 = Kale | last4 = Pastron | first4 = Allen G. | year= 2015 | title=Hide, Tallow and Terrapin: Gold Rush-Era Zooarchaeology at Thompson's Cove (CA-SFR-186H), San Francisco, California | journal= International Journal of Historical Archaeology | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=502\u2013551| doi = 10.1007/s10761-015-0297-2 }}</ref>  Initially, the large supplies of food needed were imported from close ports in Hawaii, Mexico, [[Chile]], [[Peru]], and the future state of [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. The Californios initially prospered, as there was a sudden increase in the demand for livestock. These food shipments changed mainly to shipments from Oregon and internal shipments in California as agriculture was developed in both states.\n\nStarting in 1849, many of the ship crews jumped ship and headed for the gold fields when they reached port. Soon [[San Francisco Bay]] had many hundreds of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought ''cheap'' and hauled up on the mud flats and used as [[store ship]]s, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, and a number of other uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land. The population of San Francisco exploded from about 200 in 1846 to 36,000 in the 1852 California Census.<ref>San Francisco Population 794-2000 {{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco History - Population |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=2013-10-04 }} Accessed 4 April 2011</ref>\n\nIn San Francisco, many people were initially housed in wooden houses, ships hauled up on the mud flats to serve as homes or businesses, wood-framed canvas tents used for saloons, hotels and boarding houses as well as other flammable structures. All these canvas and wood structures, combined with a lot of drunken gamblers and miners, led almost inevitably to many fires. Most of San Francisco burned down six times in six ''Great Fires'' between 1849 and 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/fire.html|title=Early History of the San Francisco Fire Department|website=Sfmuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Merchant ships fill San Francisco harbor in 1850 or 1851]]\n\n''[[Californio]]s'' who lived in California had finally had enough of the Mexican government and seized control of the territory of [[Alta California]] in 1846.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\"/> At the time gold was discovered in 1848, California had about 9,000<ref>The 1850 U.S. Census of California found 7,600 people who claimed they were born in California (Californios).

Before the Gold Rush, almost no infrastructure existed in California except a few small [[Pueblos]] (towns), secularized and abandoned [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and about 500 large (averaging over {{convert|18000|acre|km2}})  [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] owned by the Californios who had mostly taken over the Missions land and livestock.

Ships could take this route year round and the first ships started leaving East Coast ports as early as November 1848. From the East Coast, a sailing voyage around the southern tip of South America would typically take five to eight months\u2014averaging about 200 days by standard [[sailing ship]].<ref name=BrandsCape>{{Cite book|last=Brands|first=H. W. |title=The age of gold: the California Gold Rush and the new American dream |location=New York |publisher=Anchor (reprint ed.) |year=2003 |pages=103\u2013121}}</ref> This trip could easily cover over 18,000&nbsp;[[nautical mile]]s (33,000&nbsp;km) depending on the route chosen\u2014some even went by way of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] ([[History of Hawaii|Hawaii]]). When the much faster [[clipper ship]]s began to be used starting in early 1849, they could complete this journey in an average of only 120 days; but they typically carried few passengers. They specialized in high value freight. Nearly all freight to California was carried by regular sailing vessels\u2014they were slow but the cheapest way to ship cargo. Starting about 1850 many travelers to California took steamboats to Panama or Nicaragua, crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] or Nicaragua and caught another steamboat to California. In California other smaller steamboats hauled miners from [[San Francisco, California]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. [[Marysville, California]] etc. This trip could be done in 40\u201360 days\u2014depending on connections. Returning miners and/or their gold nearly all reversed this route to return to the East Coast.\n\nThose who took the [[California Trail]] usually left [[Missouri River]] towns in early April and arrived in California 150\u2013170 days later\u2014late August or early September. Mostly, farmers etc. who lived in the Mid-west and already had wagons and teams took the California trail. Some winter wagon traffic came over the [[Gila River]] ([[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|De Anza Trail]]) and routes that included parts of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]]. About half the Argonauts to California came by wagon on one of these routes.\n\n====Gold Rush effects====\nStarting in 1848 before gold in California was even confirmed, Congress had contracted with the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] to set up regular [[paddle steamer]] [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular route from [[Panama]], [[Nicaragua]] and Mexico to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to and from the [[Chagres River]] in [[Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first steamship, the ''SS Falcon (1848')'' was dispatched on December 1, 1848. The [[SS California (1848)]], the first [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] [[steamship]], showed up in San Francisco loaded with gold seekers on February 28, 1849 on its first trip from Panama and Mexico after steaming around [[Cape Horn]] from [[History of New York (state)|New York]]. Once the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed, other paddle steamers soon followed on both the Pacific and Atlantic routes. By late 1849 [[paddle steamer]]s like the ''SS McKim (1848)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ships/ss.html|title=Page moved. Automatic redirect.|website=Maritimeheritage.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> were carrying miners and business men over the {{convert|125|mi|km}} trip from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[History of Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Marysville, California]]. Steam powered [[tugboat]]s started working in the [[San Francisco Bay]] soon after this.\n\nAgriculture expanded throughout the state to meet the food needs of the new settlers. Agriculture was soon found to be limited by the difficulty of finding enough water in the right places to grow irrigated crops. Winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring was one early crop that grew well without irrigation. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no written law regarding property rights in the goldfields, and a system of \"staking claims\" was developed by the miners. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were pushed off of traditional lands and massacred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/26/california-native-americans-genocide-490824.html|title=California's state-sanctioned genocide of Native Americans|date=17 August 2016|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> and [[gold mining]] caused environmental harm.\n\nIn the early years of the California Gold Rush, [[placer mining]] methods were used, from panning to \"cradles\" and \"rockers\" or \"long-toms\", to diverting the water from an entire river into a [[sluice]] alongside the river, and then digging for gold in the gravel down to the rocky river bottom. This placer gold had been freed by the slow disintegration, over geological time, that freed the gold from its ore. This free gold was typically found in the cracks in the rocks found at the bottom of the gravel found in rivers or creeks, as the gold typically worked down through the gravel or collected in stream bends or bottom cracks. Some 12-million ounces<ref>The [[Troy weight]] system is traditionally used to measure precious metals, not the more familiar [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois weight]] system. The term \"ounces\" of gold typically refers to troy ounces. There are some historical uses where, because of the age of the use, the intention is ambiguous.</ref> (370&nbsp;[[metric ton|t]]) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush. This gold greatly increased the available money in the United States, which was on the [[gold standard]] at that time\u2014the more gold you had, the more you could buy.\n\nAs the easier gold was recovered, the mining became much more capital and labor-intensive as the hard rock quartz mining, hydraulic mining, and dredging mining evolved. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11-million ounces (340&nbsp;t) of gold (worth approximately US$6.6&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices) had been recovered via \"hydraulicking,\" a style of [[hydraulic mining]] that later spread around the world, despite its drastic environmental consequences. By the late 1890s, [[dredging]] technology had become economical,<ref name=RawlsDredge>Rawls, James J. and Orsi, Richard (eds.) (1999), p. 199.</ref> and it is estimated that more than 20&nbsp;million ounces (620&nbsp;t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$12&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices). Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, hard-rock mining wound up being the single-largest source of gold produced in the [[Gold Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/ |title=Mercury Contamination from Historical Gold Mining in California |accessdate=2008-02-26 |author1=Charles N.

Hothem |work=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the [[U.S. Navy]] started making plans for a west coast navy base at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]]. The greatly increased population, along with the new wealth of gold, caused: roads, bridges, farms, mines, steamship lines, businesses, [[western saloon|saloons]], gambling houses, boarding houses, churches, schools, towns, mercury mines, and other components of a rich modern (1850) U.S. culture to be built. The sudden growth in population caused many more towns to be built throughout Northern, and later Southern, California and the few existing towns to be greatly expanded. The first cities started showing up as [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Sacramento|Sacramento]] exploded in population.\n\n====Effects on indigenous population====\nMost California Indians are thought to have been located near the coast, the same areas the Spanish Missions were established. Since California Indians had no agriculture before it was introduced by the [[Franciscan]] padres, they were strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] society tribes which could not support large populations\u2014large populations require agriculture. During the Spanish and Mexican California occupation period nearly all coastal tribes south of San Francisco were induced to join a mission. So many Mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions at the missions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women at the missions. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission Franciscan ''padres'' from 1800 to 1830 had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> If Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have slightly different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> After the missions were disbanded in 1832 the surviving Indians mostly went to work on the about 500 newly established [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] who appropriated the mission's \"property\" (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} acres/mission). The Indians typically worked  at one of the four Spanish pueblos as servants or at the newly established ranchos for room and board or attempted to join other tribes in the interior. The new ranchos occupied nearly all their original tribal territories.\n\nThe new wave of immigration that was sparked by the gold rush would continue to have a disastrous impact on California's native population, which continued to precipitously decline mainly due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |title=Destruction of the California Indians |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |archivedate=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Like when the [[Spanish missions in California]] were established the native inhabitants were often forcefully removed from their traditional tribal lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. There were a number of massacres, including the [[Yontoket massacre]], the [[Bloody Island massacre]] at Clear Lake, and the Old Shasta Massacre, in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the state of California paid around 1.5 million dollars (some $250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=California Militia and Expeditions Against the Indians, 1850 - 1859|website=Militarymuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> to hire \"militias\" whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. These \"private military forays\" were involved in several of the above-mentioned massacres, and sometimes participated in the \"wanton killing\" of Native peoples. The first governor of California, [[Peter Burnett]], openly called for the extermination of the Indian tribes, and in reference to the violence against California's Native population, he said, \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|title=INDIANS of CALIFORNIA - American Period|website=Cabrillo.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the rise of modern California equalled great tragedy and hardship for the native inhabitants. Several scholars, including Benjamin Madley and [[Ed Castillo]], have described the actions of the California government as a [[California Genocide|genocide]].<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\"/><ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\"/>\n\nIn subsequent decades after 1850, the native population of more than 100 tribes were gradually placed in a series of reservations and rancherias, which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them in the [[hunter-gathering]] style they were used to living.\n\n====Maritime history of California====\n{{Main|Maritime history of California}}\nThe Maritime history of California includes Native American dugouts, tule canoes, and sewn canoes ([[Tomol]]s); early European explorers; Colonial Spanish and Mexican California maritime history; Russians and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] [[kayak]]s in the [[Maritime Fur Trade]].

Lincoln and London: Univ. of Nebraska Press, (1974).]</ref>\n\n====California in the American Civil War====\n{{Main|California in the American Civil War}}\n\nThe possibility of splitting off Southern California as a territory or a state was rejected by the national government, and the idea was dead by 1861 when patriotic fervor swept California after the attack on [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nCalifornia's involvement in the [[American Civil War]] included sending gold east, recruiting or funding a limited number of combat units, maintaining numerous fortifications and sending troops east, some of whom became famous. Following the split in the Democratic Party in 1860, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] supporters of Lincoln took control of the state in 1861, minimizing the influence of the large southern population. Their great success was in obtaining a Pacific railroad land grant and authorization to build the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] as the western half of the transcontinental railroad.\n\nCalifornia was settled primarily by [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] farmers, miners, and businessmen. Though the southerners and some Californios tended to favor the Confederacy, the state did not have slavery, and they were generally powerless during the war itself. They were prevented from organizing and their newspapers were closed down by denying them the use of the mail. Former Sen. [[William M. Gwin]], a Confederate sympathizer, was arrested and fled to Europe.\n\nNearly all of the men who volunteered as Union soldiers stayed in the West, within the [[Department of the Pacific]], to guard forts and other facilities, occupy secessionist regions, and fight Indians in the state and the western territories. Some 2,350 men in the [[California Column]] marched east across Arizona in 1862 to expel the Confederates from Arizona and New Mexico. The California Column then spent most of the remainder of the war fighting hostile Indians in the area.\n\n====Early California transportation====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] in 1821, the onerous Spanish rules in effect from 1770 to 1821 against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with essentially no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, nails, finished goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these [[Ranchos of California|California Ranchos]] were [[leather|cow hides]] (called California greenbacks), [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) and [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California/Texas longhorn cattle]] horns<ref>{{cite web | title=California Longhorns Vs. Texas Longhorns of Yesteryear and Today - A Comparative Study | author=Michael Casey | url=http://www.fairlealonghorns.com/Default.aspx?ID=566&Title=CaliforniavsTexasLonghorns | publisher=Fairlea Longhorns | accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in [[sailing ship]]s about {{convert|17000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] written about 1832 provides a good first hand account of this trade.,<ref name=\"Dana, Richard 2010\">Dana, Richard; ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea'' Republished by CreateSpace (2010)  {{ISBN|978-1-4564-7282-5}}</ref><ref>Google eBook [https://archive.org/details/twoyearsbeforem01smitgoog ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea''] accessed 9 February 2012</ref>\n\nFrom 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> The port of entry for trading purposes was the Alta California Capital, [[Monterey, California]], where custom duties ([[tariff]]s) of about 100% were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs (custom duties). In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs (also called Customs or [[ad valorem tax]]es), although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\"/>\n\nShips after 1848 provided easy, cheap, links among the coastal towns within California and on routes leading there. Nearly all cargo to California came by [[sailing ship]] until the completion of the [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. The sea route was more than {{convert|17000|mi|km}} route from the east coast or Europe around [[Cape Horn]] in [[South America]]. This route averaged about 200 days by \"standard\" [[sailing ship]] or about 120 days by [[Clipper]]. One of the main problems that occurred during the gold rush was the lack of a paying cargo for ships leaving California. Food, supplies and passengers were the main cargo coming to California; but there were only a limited return trade of returning passengers, mail and gold. Many of the sailing ships that arrived in [[San Francisco Bay]] were abandoned there or converted into warehouses or landfill.\n\nThe Panama and Nicaragua routes provided a shortcut for getting from the East Coast to California and a brisk maritime passenger trade developed, featuring fast [[paddle steamer]]s from cities on the east coast, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Havana]] Cuba to the Caribbean mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the mouth of [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. After a trip up the Chagres River by native dugouts the last {{convert|20|mi|km}} were completed to Panama City by mule back. The trip up the San Juan River in Nicaragua was usually done by small steam launch to [[Lake Nicaragua]], a boat trip on the lake and a final {{convert|25|mi|km}} trip by stage coach or mule back to [[San Juan del Sur]] or other city in the Pacific side of Nicaragua. After 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed the Nicaragua route largely shut down.\n\nIn 1846 the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled with [[Great Britain]] and California was under U.S. control in 1847 and annexed and paid for in 1848. The United States was now a Pacific Ocean power. Starting in 1848 the [[U.S. Congress]], after the annexation of California but before the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed there, had subsidized the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] with $199,999 to set up regular [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular scheduled route from [[Panama City]], Nicaragua and [[Mexico]] to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans]] to and from the mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in [[Isthmus of Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first [[paddle wheel]] steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail\u2014the [[Chagres River]].\n\nIn 1849 [[William H. Aspinwall]], the man who had won the bid for the building and operating of the Pacific mail steamships, conceived a plan to construct a railway across the [[isthmus of Panama]]; he and his partners created a company registered in New York, the [[Panama Railroad Company]], raised US$1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California or return home. [[Cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]] took a deadly toll on the Railroad workers, and despite the continual importation of large numbers of new workers, there were times when the work stalled for simple lack of alive and semi-fit workers. All railroad supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the [[Caribbean]] Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924021538214/page/n34 <!-- pg=21 -->  Fessenden Nott Otis, '''Isthmus of Panama: History of the Panama railroad; and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company''', Harper & Brothers, New York, 1867 pp. 21-36.]</ref> Upon completion in 1855 the road stretched {{convert|47|mi|km}} and had cost over $8,000,000 and about 5,000 lives.

She was loaded with about 400 gold seeking passengers; twice the number of passengers it had been designed for. In San Francisco all her passengers and crew except the captain and one man deserted the ship and it would take the Captain two more months to gather a much better paid return crew to return to Panama city an establish the route they had been contracted for. Many more paddle steamers were soon running from the east coast cities to the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. By the mid 1850s there were over ten Pacific and ten Atlantic/Caribbean paddle wheel steamboats shuttling high valued freight like passengers, gold and mail between California and both the Pacific and Caribbean ports. The trip to the east coast could be executed after about 1850 in as short as 40 days if all ship connections could be met with a minimum of waiting.\n\nSteamboats plied the Bay Area and the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s that flowed nearer the goldfields, moving passengers and supplies from San Francisco to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Stockton, California]]\u2014the three main cities supplying the gold fields. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields in the foothills of the Sierra.

Soon a system of wagon roads, bridges, ferries and toll roads were set up many of them maintained by tolls collected from the users. Large freight wagons pulled by up to 10 mules replaced pack trains, and toll roads built and kept passable by the tolls made it easier to get to the mining camps, enabling express companies to deliver firewood, lumber, food, equipment, clothes, mail, packages, etc. to the miners. Later when communities developed in Nevada some steamboats were even used to haul cargo up the [[Colorado River]] as high as where [[Lake Mead]] in Nevada is today.\n\n[[File:Butterfield-Overland.gif|thumb|500px|''The stage routes from a Butterfield Overland Mail Company map.'']]\n\nThe '''[[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line''' <ref>Also known as the '''Oxbow Route''', the '''Butterfield Overland Stage''', or the '''Butterfield Stage'''</ref> was a [[stagecoach]] service  operating from 1857 to 1861 of over {{convert|2800|mi|km}}.

An [[Act of Congress]], approved March 2, 1861, discontinued this route and service ceased June 30, 1861. On the same date the central route from St. Joseph, Missouri, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[Carson City, Nevada]] and on to [[Placerville, California]], went into effect. From the end of Central Overland route in [[Carson City, Nevada]] they followed the Placerville Toll road route over Johnson Pass (now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Highway 50]]) to California since it was the fastest and only route that was then kept open in winter across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\">Root, ''The Overland Stage to California'', p. 42:</ref> The 1800 draft horses and mules, 250 coaches, etc., on the southern [[Gila River]] route Butterfield Stage route were pulled off and moved to the new route between [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] and [[Placerville, California]] along the existing [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail]]s to Salt Lake City and then through central Utah and Nevada. On 30 June 1861 the ''[[Central Nevada Route|Central Overland California Route]]'' from [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], to [[Placerville, California]], went into effect. By traveling day and night and using team changes about every {{convert|10|mile|km}} the stages could make the trip in about 28 days. News paper correspondents reported that they had a preview of \"hell\" when they took the trip.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\"/>\n\nOnce cargo was moved off the ocean and rivers it nearly always transported by horse or ox drawn wagons\u2014still true till about 1920. When there was not a wagon trail the cargo was shifted to mule pack trains or carried on the backs of the miners. Lumber to build new homes, sluice boxes, etc. was a crying need and food to feed the miners was needed even more. However, California has a lot of native timber and even as early as 1850 there were saw mills set up to turn some of this timber into lumber. Food was initially imported from any and all west coast ports from Hawaii, Oregon or Mexico where it could be obtained. The lumber and food were transported by ships that had initially carried gold rush passengers and in many cases abandoned in the bay and could usually be bought cheap. The many goods the gold miners needed for a \"modest\" 1850s lifestyle were nearly always hauled by horse, mule or ox drawn wagons. Wheat and timber were early products from Oregon and the [[Columbia River]] area that could be economically imported. Soon it was found that some types of spring wheat could be planted in the fall in California and the mild winter with its rains would allow good crops to be harvested in the spring without irrigation. Later. much of this wheat was exported to ports around the world, California finally had a return cargo for its many incoming ships. California in the 1890s became the foremost wheat producer in the U.S. but could not really compete on the east coast with the burgeoning wheat lands being brought into production in the midwest were much closer to their markets. Other crops in California were usually found to be much more profitable and California joined the rest of the nation in importing most of its wheat from farms in the midwest.\n\nThe year 1848 saw the close of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the beginning of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros']] greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good  first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to California which he took in 1834\u20135. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of ''Two Years Before the Mast'' is available at Gutenberg project.)<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4277?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana|website=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=7 November 2017|date=July 2003}}</ref> A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was no easy way to preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up\u2014the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the \"golden\" days of Hispanic California. The largely illiterate ranchero owners lost nearly all their land to a few bad years for cattle in the 1860s and the many mortgages they had taken out to finance a \"prosperous\" life style and could no longer pay back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/cattle.html|title=Monterey County Historical Society, Local History Pages--The California Cattle Boom, 1849-1862|website=Mchsmuseum.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.<ref>Hutchinson, W.

These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] stations (completed 24 October 1861). The Pony express terminated soon after the telegraph was established. This combination wagon-stagecoach-pony express-telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pony Express Trail map |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf|website=Fs.fed.us|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> From Salt Lake City, the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon-California-Oregon trail(s) to Omaha, Nebraska. After the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869, the telegraph lines along the railroad tracks became the main line, since the required relay stations, lines and telegraph operators were much easier to supply and maintain along the railroad. The telegraph lines that diverged from the railroad lines or significant population centers were largely abandoned.\n\nAfter the 1870s, stagecoaches provided the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns that were not connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and [[paddle wheel]] steamships connecting port cities. Freight wagons still hauled nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger [[Concord stagecoach]], but the cheaper, rougher \"mud wagons\" were also in general use. The [[Wells Fargo]] company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from rough unpaved roads, rough rides, un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired [[stagecoach]]es. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes\u2014a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture as they may be shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.\n\n====Railroads====\n[[File:East and West Shaking hands at the laying of last rail Union Pacific Railroad - Restoration.jpg|thumb|Workers drive in the [[golden spike]] on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], 1869]]\n{{Main|History of rail transportation in California}}\n\nCalifornia's first railroad was built from Sacramento to Folsom, California starting in February 1855.

The [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] from [[Sacramento, California]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was completed on 9 May 1869. The [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the Pacific end of the railroad, largely took over nearly all freight across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains in Northern California.

Each of these railroads controlled one (and Southern Pacific controlled two) of the transcontinental railroads which linked California with states farther East. The railroads moved freight and passengers in large quantities and allowed the state's economy and population to expand rapidly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBy the 1890s the construction of electric railroads had begun in California and by the early 20th century several systems existed to serve California's largest cities. The state's electric railroad systems included the [[San Diego Electric Railway]], Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system, the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], [[East Bay Electric Lines]] and the [[Key System|San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway]] and [[Interurban]] rail systems such as the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] were also constructed. By the 1920s, Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system was the largest electric railroad in the world.\n\n[[File:Amtrak Capitol Corridor.jpg|thumb|An Amtrak Capitol Corridor train passing through [[Santa Clara Station (California)|Santa Clara Station]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe expansion of American railroads peaked in the 1910s and during [[the Great Depression]] many railroads suffered financial difficulties which led to some railroad bankruptcies. [[World War II]] caused a surge in the use of California's railroads but with the government funded construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s and the expansion of the [[Airline#U.S. airline industry|U.S. airline industry]] passenger rail service declined dramatically.\n\nThe 1970s saw the end of private passenger railroads in California, the creation of a national passenger railroad ([[Amtrak]]) and the [[Bay Area]]'s opening of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] rail-system. In the 1980s and 1990s commuter railroads where established in the Bay Area ([[Caltrain]] and [[Altamont Corridor Express]]), Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]) and San Diego ([[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster]]) and [[light rail]] networks were built or expanded in most urban areas.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the expansion in usage of passenger rail service and in 2008 [[California Proposition 1A (2008)|voters approved]] plans for the construction of a [[California High-Speed Rail|high-speed rail network]].\n\n==History of California, 1900 to present==\n{{Main|History of California 1900 to present}}\nAfter 1900, California continued to grow rapidly and soon became an agricultural and industrial power.

The films and stars of [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention.

The Panthers compete in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the East Division of [[Conference USA]] (CUSA). The Panthers' head coach is [[Butch Davis]]. FIU has produced a Sun Belt Conference co-championship team in 2010, along with 3 postseason bowl appearances. The Panthers play their home games at [[Riccardo Silva Stadium]] which has a seating capacity of 20,000.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of FIU Panthers football seasons}}\n\n===Don Strock era (2002\u20132006)===\nOn 1 September 1999, after several years of contemplating the commencement of a football team, FIU moved a step closer by hiring [[Don Strock]] to be FIU's Director of Football Operations. One year later, [[Don Strock]] was named head coach with plans to lay the foundations for a college football team. Quarter-back David Tabor was the first FIU football recruit. In February 2002, FIU found its star quarter-back in high school, Jamie Burke from Cardinal Mooney High, Sarasota, Florida. Burke was the only player to ever throw for over 500 yards in a single game in Florida as well as led the state in touchdown passes in a season with 34. Burke was being recruited by the [[University of Florida]] but opted for FIU when [[Steve Spurrier]] left to coach the [[Washington Redskins]]. FIU had everything it needed to begin competing in [[NCAA]] Football. FIU was placed in the [[Division I-AA]] level as an Independent team.\n\nFIU won its inaugural game on August 29, 2002 against [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)]], 27\u20133. The team played fairly well against the competition that season and managed to finish with a 5-6 record. The Golden Panthers then hoped to build on that in the coming 2003 season. FIU signed to play more challenging teams of the division in hopes to get more recognition as a solid football team. The opening game of the following season started with a loss to Indiana State, and it led to a 0\u20138 start for the second-year team. They failed to reach the standard set the season before and fell to a 2\u201310 season. The next season followed with similar results, finishing with a 3\u20137 record.\n\nAfter the 2004 season, FIU moved up to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] FBS, formerly known as [[Division I-A]], despite their relative lack of success in their first three seasons in Division I FCS. FIU became the fastest school in the history of college football to reach the highest level.  This has since been eclipsed by multiple schools during the conference movement in 2012.\n\n[[File:FIU Stadium.JPG|thumb|250px|The Panthers play at the on-campus [[Riccardo Silva Stadium]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]\n\nThe Panthers moved to Division I-A in 2005. Many of the season's players were from the 2003 recruiting class. [[Keyonvis Bouie]], FIU's linebacker recorded 118 tackles in nine games, 11 for a loss and three interceptions. A second linebacker, [[Antwan Barnes]] recorded 15 tackles for a loss and added 11 sacks to his statistics. On offense, FIU's quarterback, [[Josh Padrick]] who passed for 2743 yards and 13 touchdowns. His primary target was [[Chandler Williams]], who caught 61 passes for a total of 870 yards. It was these defensive performances that allowed FIU to compete with the teams in Division I-A and finish the season 5\u20136.\n\nFIU had found the foundation upon which the team would be built. As characteristic of FIU's athletic department, the following year, FIU signed to play harder teams. FIU was headed in the right direction but still lacked consistency, and organization. As they began their 2006 season they almost evenly matched the teams which they played, losing almost all of their first few games by very narrow margins: [[Middle Tennessee]] 7\u20136, [[University of South Florida|USF]] 21\u201320, [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] 33\u201328, [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] 14\u201310, and [[University of North Texas]] 22\u201325 (7OTs).\n\n{{See also|Florida International University \u2013 University of Miami brawl}}\nOn October 14, 2006, FIU and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] met for the first time in what was supposed to be the beginning of an annual cross-town [[sports rivalry|rivalry game]]. Nine minutes into the second half the two teams [[Miami-FIU brawl|engaged in a brawl]] involving players from both schools, including one injured FIU player on crutches and one UM player using his helmet as a weapon. The violence later spilled into the stands, where several spectators were arrested and later released without charges. 31 players were later punished for the incident, including 13 Miami players and 18 FIU players. Two FIU players were kicked off the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2627372\n|title=Miami, FIU have 31 suspended for role in brawl |date=October 16, 2006 |location=CORAL GABLES, Florida |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FIU Duke 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Riccardo Silva Stadium during the 2011 Homecoming game versus [[Duke University]]]]\n\nThe FIU defense still finished 28th nationally, and 4th in pass defense. Antwan Barnes ranked 3rd in the nation in tackles for loss with 22 and 6 sacks. Bouie gained 119 tackles 18 for loss, and Alexander Bostic would add 98 tackles, 19 for loss and 8 sacks. Barnes, Bouie and, Bostic came to be known as the \"Killer B's\". On offense, FIU's receiver Chandler Williams, caught 67 passes for 664 yards.\n\n===Mario Cristobal era (2007\u20132012)===\nIn 2006, Barnes and Williams were both drafted to the NFL. That same year, the FIU Athletics Department hired a new athletic director [[Pete Garcia]], and found a new head coach for the team, [[Mario Cristobal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1945156.html|title=FIU fires football coach Cristobal|publisher=}}</ref> Cristobal became the second youngest Division I-A coach at 37. Cristobal brought in a new coaching staff in hopes to turn the program around.\n\nIn 2007, FIU was the second-youngest team in Division I-A. 2/3 were underclassmen, mostly freshmen. During the 2007 season, FIU played its home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] during the expansion of Riccardo Silva Stadium to 20,000 seats. The Golden Panthers concluded the season with a win against North Texas 38\u201319. It was the last college football game ever played at the historic Orange Bowl prior to its demolition and the last home win at that stadium. In September 2008, the Panthers inaugurated the expanded Riccardo Silva Stadium by hosting the [[South Florida Bulls]] with a crowd of over 16,000. FIU lost the game 17\u20139. The team would go on to win the next three games in a showing of a much improved team from the 2006 and 2007 team.\n\nOn Saturday, November 27, 2010, FIU defeated [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] to clinch the Sun Belt Conference Title. This earned FIU its first bowl berth in the short history of its football program. Twenty-nine days later, on December 26, they became [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesars Champions]]. Fans brought signs saying, \"\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\", Spanish for \"Yes we can!\" On December 3, 2011, FIU accepted an invitation to play in the [[2011 Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl]], the school's second consecutive bowl game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130813/http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID%3D205042871%26DB_OEM_ID%3D11700 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407122104/http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205042871&DB_OEM_ID=11700 |archivedate=2012-04-07 }}</ref>\n\nAfter going from an 8\u20135 season in 2011 to a 3\u20139 season in 2012, FIU Athletic Director Pete Garcia made the decision to fire Cristobal because \"we\u2019ve gone backwards over the last year and a half.

It was these defensive performances that allowed FIU to compete with the teams in Division I-A and finish the season 5\u20136.\n\nFIU had found the foundation upon which the team would be built. As characteristic of FIU's athletic department, the following year, FIU signed to play harder teams. FIU was headed in the right direction but still lacked consistency, and organization. As they began their 2006 season they almost evenly matched the teams which they played, losing almost all of their first few games by very narrow margins: [[Middle Tennessee]] 7\u20136, [[University of South Florida|USF]] 21\u201320, [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] 33\u201328, [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] 14\u201310, and [[University of North Texas]] 22\u201325 (7OTs).\n\n{{See also|Florida International University \u2013 University of Miami brawl}}\nOn October 14, 2006, FIU and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] met for the first time in what was supposed to be the beginning of an annual cross-town [[sports rivalry|rivalry game]]. Nine minutes into the second half the two teams [[Miami-FIU brawl|engaged in a brawl]] involving players from both schools, including one injured FIU player on crutches and one UM player using his helmet as a weapon. The violence later spilled into the stands, where several spectators were arrested and later released without charges. 31 players were later punished for the incident, including 13 Miami players and 18 FIU players. Two FIU players were kicked off the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2627372\n|title=Miami, FIU have 31 suspended for role in brawl |date=October 16, 2006 |location=CORAL GABLES, Florida |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FIU Duke 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Riccardo Silva Stadium during the 2011 Homecoming game versus [[Duke University]]]]\n\nThe FIU defense still finished 28th nationally, and 4th in pass defense. Antwan Barnes ranked 3rd in the nation in tackles for loss with 22 and 6 sacks. Bouie gained 119 tackles 18 for loss, and Alexander Bostic would add 98 tackles, 19 for loss and 8 sacks. Barnes, Bouie and, Bostic came to be known as the \"Killer B's\". On offense, FIU's receiver Chandler Williams, caught 67 passes for 664 yards.\n\n===Mario Cristobal era (2007\u20132012)===\nIn 2006, Barnes and Williams were both drafted to the NFL. That same year, the FIU Athletics Department hired a new athletic director [[Pete Garcia]], and found a new head coach for the team, [[Mario Cristobal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1945156.html|title=FIU fires football coach Cristobal|publisher=}}</ref> Cristobal became the second youngest Division I-A coach at 37. Cristobal brought in a new coaching staff in hopes to turn the program around.\n\nIn 2007, FIU was the second-youngest team in Division I-A. 2/3 were underclassmen, mostly freshmen. During the 2007 season, FIU played its home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] during the expansion of Riccardo Silva Stadium to 20,000 seats. The Golden Panthers concluded the season with a win against North Texas 38\u201319. It was the last college football game ever played at the historic Orange Bowl prior to its demolition and the last home win at that stadium. In September 2008, the Panthers inaugurated the expanded Riccardo Silva Stadium by hosting the [[South Florida Bulls]] with a crowd of over 16,000. FIU lost the game 17\u20139. The team would go on to win the next three games in a showing of a much improved team from the 2006 and 2007 team.\n\nOn Saturday, November 27, 2010, FIU defeated [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] to clinch the Sun Belt Conference Title. This earned FIU its first bowl berth in the short history of its football program. Twenty-nine days later, on December 26, they became [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesars Champions]]. Fans brought signs saying, \"\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\", Spanish for \"Yes we can!\" On December 3, 2011, FIU accepted an invitation to play in the [[2011 Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl]], the school's second consecutive bowl game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130813/http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID%3D205042871%26DB_OEM_ID%3D11700 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407122104/http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205042871&DB_OEM_ID=11700 |archivedate=2012-04-07 }}</ref>\n\nAfter going from an 8\u20135 season in 2011 to a 3\u20139 season in 2012, FIU Athletic Director Pete Garcia made the decision to fire Cristobal because \"we\u2019ve gone backwards over the last year and a half.
