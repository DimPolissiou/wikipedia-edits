He painted himself among his sisters, but later removed the image so as not to clutter the picture.<br>[[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]] [[File:Branwell.gif|thumb|right|Branwell Bront\u00eb, self-portrait, 1840]]\n\nThe '''Bront\u00ebs''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|r|\u0252|n|t|i|z}}) were a nineteenth-century literary family, born in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] and later associated with the village of [[Haworth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The sisters, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] (1816\u20131855), [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]] (1818\u20131848), and [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]] (1820\u20131849), are well known as poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they originally published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories immediately attracted attention for their passion and originality. Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' was the first to know success, while Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', Anne's ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' and other works were later to be accepted as masterpieces of literature.\n\nThe three sisters and their brother, [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]] (1817\u20131848), were very close and during childhood developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set therein.\n\nThe deaths of first their mother, and then of their two older sisters marked them profoundly and influenced their writing, as did the relative isolation in which they were raised.\n\nThe Bront\u00eb birthplace in [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the [[parsonage]] at [[Haworth]] in Yorkshire, now the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum]], welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n== Origin of the name 1830\u20131852 ==\nThe Bront\u00eb family can be traced to the [[Irish clan]] ''\u00d3 Pronntaigh'', which literally means \"descendant of Pronntach\". They were a family of hereditary scribes and literary men in [[Fermanagh]]. The version \u00d3 Proinntigh, which was first given Patrick Woulfe in his ''Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall'' (Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner)<ref name=PW>Woulfe, Patrick, '' Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall: Irish names and Surnames'' (Baile Atha Cliath: M. H. Gill, 1922), p. 79</ref> and reproduced without question by MacLysaght ''inter alia'', cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries and all of them used the spelling \u00d3 Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word ''pronntach'' or ''bronntach'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?Fuzzy=0&cv=1&searchtext=(id%20contains%20B)%20and%20(column%20contains%20202)&sortField=ID&sortDIR=65602&respage=0&resperpage=10&bhcp=1|title=Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=22 January 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref> which is related to the word ''bronnadh'', meaning giving or bestowal (''pronn'' is given as an Ulster version of ''bronn'' in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.)<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Edward|title=An Irish\u2013English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jmk9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT382&lpg=PT382&dq=pronnaim#v=onepage|year=1821}}</ref> The author of ''Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall'', suggested that it was derived from ''proinnteach'' (the refectory of a monastery).<ref name=PW/> ''\u00d3 Pronntaigh'' was earlier [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as ''Prunty'' and sometimes ''Brunty''.\n\nAt some point, the father of the sisters, [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]] (born Brunty), decided on the alternative spelling with the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over the terminal ''e'' to indicate that the name has two syllables. It is not known for certain what motivated him to do so, and multiple theories exist to account for the change. He may have wished to hide his humble origins.<ref name=Haworth/> As a [[man of letters]], he would have been familiar with [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]] and may have chosen the name after the Greek [[wikt:\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae|\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae]] (\"thunder\"). One view, put forward by the biographer [[C. K. Shorter]] in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with [[Admiral Horatio Nelson]], who was also [[Duke of Bronte|Duke of Bront\u00e9]].<ref>[[Clement King Shorter]], ''Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her circle'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1896), p. 29</ref> Evidence for this may be found in his desire to associate himself with the [[Duke of Wellington]] in his form of dress.\n\n== Members of the Bront\u00eb family ==\n\n=== Patrick Bront\u00eb ===\n[[File:Patrickbronte.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Patrick Bront\u00eb around 1860.]]\n[[Patrick Bront\u00eb]] (17 March 1777 \u2013 7 June 1861), the Bront\u00eb sisters\u2019 father, was born in [[Loughbrickland]], [[County Down]], Ireland, of a family of farm workers of moderate means.<ref name=Haworth>{{cite web|url=http://www.haworth-village.org.uk/brontes/patrick/patrick.asp|title=Patrick Bronte Biography|website=Haworth-village.org.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> His birth name was Patrick Prunty or Brunty.

However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the radical [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], and he wanted to distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;11,&nbsp;note&nbsp;50.}}</ref> He is the author of ''Cottage Poems'' (1811), ''The Rural Minstrel'' (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.\n\nIn 1812, he met and married 29-year-old Maria Branwell<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=48}}</ref> and by 1820 they had moved into the parsonage at Haworth where he took up the post of [[Perpetual Curate]] (Haworth was an ancient chapelry in the large parish of [[Bradford]], so he could not be rector or vicar.)

Her father had a flourishing tea and grocery store and had accumulated considerable wealth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995| pp=48\u201349,&nbsp;52}}</ref>\nMaria died at the age of 38 of [[uterine cancer]].<ref>Fraser, Lyndon (2012). ''Far from Home: The English in New Zealand'', p. 103. University of Otago Press, Dunedin. {{ISBN|9781877578328}}.</ref> She married the same day as her younger sister Charlotte in the church at [[Guiseley]] after her fianc\u00e9 had celebrated the union of two other couples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=47}}</ref> She was a literate and pious woman, known for her lively spirit, joyfulness, and tenderness, and it was she who designed the samplers that are on display in the museum and had them embroidered by her children. She left memories with her husband and with Charlotte, the oldest surviving sibling, of a very vivacious woman at the parsonage. The younger ones, particularly Emily and Anne, admitted to retaining only vague images of their mother, especially of her suffering on her sickbed.\n\n=== Elizabeth Branwell ===\n{{main|Elizabeth Branwell}}\nElizabeth Branwell (2 December 1776 \u2013 29 October 1842) arrived from Penzance in 1821, aged 45, after the death of Maria, her younger sister, to help Patrick look after the children, and was known as 'Aunt Branwell'. Elizabeth Branwell, who raised the children after the death of their mother, was a Methodist. It seems, nevertheless, that her denomination did not exert any influence on the children. It was Aunt Branwell who taught the children arithmetic, the alphabet, how to sew,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=17}}</ref> embroidery and cross-stitching appropriate for ladies. Aunt Branwell also gave them books and subscribed to ''Fraser's Magazine'', less interesting than ''Blackwood's'', but, nevertheless, providing plenty of material for discussion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=179}}</ref> She was a generous person who dedicated her life to her nieces and nephew, neither marrying nor returning to visit her relations in Cornwall.\nShe died of [[bowel obstruction]] in October 1842, after a brief agony, comforted by her beloved nephew Branwell. In her last will, Aunt Branwell left to her three nieces the considerable sum of  \u00a3900 (about \u00a395,700 in 2017 currency), which allowed them to resign their low-paid jobs as governesses and teachers.\n\n=== Children ===\n[[File:Bronte Parsonage Museum.JPG|thumb|The parsonage in Haworth, the former family home, is now the ''[[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum]]''.]]\n\n[[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]] (1814\u20131825), the eldest, was born in Clough House, High Town, on 23 April 1814.  She suffered from hunger, cold, and privation at [[Cowan Bridge School]]. Charlotte described her as very lively, very sensitive, and particularly advanced in her reading. She returned from school with an advanced case of [[tuberculosis]] and died at Haworth at the age of 11 on 6 May 1825.\n\n[[Elizabeth Bront\u00eb|Elizabeth]] (1815\u20131825), the second child, joined her sister Maria at Cowan Bridge where she suffered the same fate. Elizabeth was less vivacious than her brother and her sisters and apparently less advanced for her age. She died on 15 June 1825 at the age of 10, within two weeks of returning home to her father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=25}}</ref>\n\n[[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] (1816\u20131855), born in Market Street [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], near [[Bradford]], West Riding of Yorkshire, on 21 April 1816, was a poet and novelist and is the author of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', her best known work, and three other novels. She died on 31 March 1855 just before reaching the age of 39.\n\n[[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Patrick Branwell]] (1817\u20131848) was born in Market Street Thornton on 26 June 1817. Known as ''Branwell'', he was a painter, writer and casual worker. He became addicted to alcohol and [[laudanum]] and died at Haworth on 24 September 1848 at the age of 31.\n\n[[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily Jane]] (1818\u20131848), born in Market Street Thornton, 30 July 1818, was a poet and novelist. She died in Haworth on 19 December 1848 at the age of 30.  ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' was her only novel.\n\n[[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]] (1820\u20131849), born in Market Street Thornton on 17 January 1820, was a poet and novelist. She wrote a largely autobiographical novel entitled ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', but her second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848), was far more ambitious. She died on 28 May 1849 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] at the age of 29.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Cowan Bridge School ===\nIn 1824, the four eldest girls (excluding Anne) entered the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge]],<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XVI.</ref> which educated the children of less prosperous members of the clergy, which had been recommended to Mr Bront\u00eb. The following year, Maria and Elizabeth fell gravely ill and were removed from the school, but died shortly afterwards within a few weeks of each other on 6 May and 15 June 1825.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=137\u2013139}}</ref> Charlotte and Emily were also withdrawn from the school and returned to Haworth. The loss of their sisters was a trauma that showed in Charlotte's writing. In ''Jane Eyre'', Cowan Bridge becomes Lowood, Maria is represented by the character of the young Helen Burns, the cruelty of the mistress Miss Andrews by that of Miss Scatcherd, and the tyranny of the headmaster, the [[William Carus Wilson|Rev. Carus Wilson]], by that of Mr Brocklehurst.\n\nTuberculosis, which afflicted Maria and Elizabeth in 1825, was the eventual cause of death of three of the surviving Bront\u00ebs: Branwell in September 1848, Emily in December 1848, and finally, Anne five months later in May 1849.\n\nPatrick Bront\u00eb faced a challenge in arranging for the education of the girls of his family, which was barely middle class. They had no significant connections and he could not afford the fees for them to attend an established school for young ladies. One solution was the schools where the fees were reduced to a minimum \u2013 so called \"charity schools\" \u2013 with a mission to assist families such as those of the lower clergy. One cannot accuse Mr. Bront\u00eb of not having done everything possible to find a solution that he thought would be best for his daughters. As Barker comments, he had read in the ''Leeds Intelligencer'' of 6 November 1823 the reports of cases in the Court of Commons in Bowes, and he later read other cases decided on 24 November 1824 near Richmond, two towns in the county of Yorkshire, where pupils had been discovered gnawed by rats and suffering from malnutrition to the extent that some of them had lost their sight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=119}}</ref> There was nothing to suggest that the Reverend Carus Wilson's Clergy Daughters' School would not provide a good education and good care for his daughters. The school was not expensive, and its patrons (supporters who allowed the school to use their names) were all respected people, including the daughter of Hannah Moore, an author of recognised works and a close friend of the poet [[William Cowper]], both proponents of a correct education for young girls; and the offspring of different prelates and even certain acquaintances of Patrick Bront\u00eb including [[William Wilberforce]], young women whose fathers had also been educated at St John's College, Cambridge.  Thus Bront\u00eb believed Wilson's school to have a number of the necessary guarantees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n=== John Bradley ===\n{{main|John Bradley (d. 1844)}}\nIn 1829\u201330, Patrick Bront\u00eb engaged [[John Bradley (d. 1844)|John Bradley]], an artist from neighbouring [[Keighley]], as drawing-master for the children. Bradley was an artist of some local repute, rather than a professional instructor, but he may well have fostered Branwell's enthusiasm for art and architecture.<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{harvnb|Alexander|Sellars|1995|pp=23\u201324, 33.}}</ref>\n\n=== Miss Wooler's school ===\n[[File:Roe Head, Mirfield - geograph.org.uk - 55901.jpg|thumb|left|Roe Head, Mirfield, Miss Wooler's school]]\n[[File:CharlotteBronte.jpg|thumb|upright|Disputed photograph taken about 1855; sources are in disagreement over whether this image is of Charlotte Bront\u00eb or of her friend, [[Ellen Nussey]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1613719.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194617/http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1613719.ece |archivedate=4 March 2016|title=To walk invisible |publisher=TLS |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brontesisters.co.uk/Photo-of-Charlotte-Bronte.html|title=The Bronte Sisters \u2013 A True Likeness? \u2013 Photo of Charlotte Bronte|website=Brontesisters.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>]]\n[[File:ellennussey1855.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ellen Nussey]] around 1855, at the time of the death of Charlotte.]]\n[[File:Bront\u00eb Letter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A letter from Charlotte Bront\u00eb to her friend, [[Ellen Nussey]]<ref group=\"N\">In this letter dated 21 April 1844, the day of her 28th birthday, she thanks her friend Nell for the gift, returns the gesture by sending her some lace: \"I hope\" she adds \"they will not peck it out of the envelope at the Bradford Post-office, where they generally take the liberty of opening letters when they feel soft as if they contained articles\".</ref>]]\n\nIn 1831, 14-year-old Charlotte was enrolled at the school of Miss Wooler in Roe Head, [[Mirfield]]. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in [[Keighley]] nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation and he remembered the building which he passed when strolling around the parishes of [[Kirklees]], [[Dewsbury]], and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=757\u2013758}}</ref><ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XVII.</ref> Patrick's choice of school was excellent \u2013 Charlotte was happy there and studied well. She made many lifelong friends, in particular [[Ellen Nussey]] and Mary Taylor who later went to New Zealand before returning to England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=446,&nbsp;465}}</ref> Charlotte returned from Roe Head in June 1832, missing her friends, but happy to rejoin her family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=170\u2013175,&nbsp;181\u2013183}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, Miss Wooler offered her former pupil a position as her assistant. The family decided that Emily would accompany her to pursue studies that would otherwise have been unaffordable. Emily's fees were partly covered by Charlotte's salary. Emily was 17 and it was the first time she had left Haworth since leaving Cowan Bridge. On 29 July 1835, the sisters left for Roe Head. The same day, Branwell wrote a letter to the [[Royal Academy of Art]] in London, to present several of his drawings as part of his candidature as a probationary student.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=224\u2013226}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte taught, and wrote about her students without much sympathy. Emily did not settle and after three months she seemed to decline and had to be taken home to the parsonage. Anne took her place and stayed until Christmas 1837.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=235\u2013237}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte avoided boredom by following the development of Angria which she received in letters from her brother. During holidays at Haworth, she wrote long narratives while being reproached by her father who wanted her to become more involved in parish affairs. These were coming to a head over the imposition of the Church rates, a local tax levied on parishes where the majority of the population were dissenters. In the meantime, Miss Wooler moved to Heald's House, at [[Dewsbury Moor]], where Charlotte complained about the humidity that made her unwell. Upon leaving the establishment in 1838 Miss Wooler presented her with a parting gift of  ''The Vision of Don Roderick and Rokeby'', a collection of poems by [[Walter Scott]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=238\u2013291}}</ref>\n\n== Literary evolution ==\nThe children became interested in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was the younger ones whose pastime it became to develop them. At the centre of the children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Bront\u00eb gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826.<ref name=\"Smith 28\">{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=28}}</ref> These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as ''the Young Men'', and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5F_n_qxvHSYC&pg=PA77&dq=gondal+angria+glass+town+bront%C3%AB&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA75,M1 David W. Harrison, ''The Brontes of Haworth'' pp.&nbsp;75\u201376.].</ref> and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=29}}</ref> followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]], an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831.<ref name=\"Smith 30\">{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=30}}</ref> In the beginning, these stories were written in ''little books'', the size of a matchbox {{nowrap|(about 1.5 x 2.5 inches\u20143.8 x 6.4&nbsp;cm)}},<ref name=\"Smith 30\"/> and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed,<ref name=\"Smith 28\"/> or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.\n\n=== Literary and artistic influence ===\nThese fictional worlds were the product of fertile imagination fed by reading, discussion, and a passion for literature. Far from suffering from the negative influences that never left them and which were reflected in the works of their later, more mature years, the Bront\u00eb children absorbed them with open arms.\n\n==== Press ====\nThe periodicals that Patrick Bront\u00eb read were a mine of information for his children. The ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'' and ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', conservative and well written, but better than the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' that defended the same political ideas whilst addressing a less refined readership (the reason Mr. Bront\u00eb did not read it),<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=105}}</ref> were exploited in every detail. ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in particular, was not only the source of their knowledge of world affairs, but also provided material for the Bront\u00ebs' early writing.  For instance, an article in the June 1826 number of ''Blackwood\u2019s'', provides commentary on new discoveries from the exploration of [[central Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=James |last=Macqueen|title= Geography of Central Africa. Denham and Clapperton's Journals|journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine|volume= 19:113 |date=June 1826|pages = 687\u2013709}}</ref>   The map included with the article highlights geographical features the Bront\u00ebs reference in their tales: the Jibbel Kumera (the [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]]), [[Ashantee]], and the rivers [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Calabar River|Calabar]].  The author also advises the British to expand into Africa from Fernando Po, where, Christine Alexander notes, the Bront\u00eb children locate the Great Glass Town.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christine |last=Alexander|title=The Early Writings of Charlotte Bront\u00eb|location =Oxford|publisher= Blackwell|year= 1983| page= 30}}</ref>  Their knowledge of geography was completed by Goldsmith's ''Grammar of General Geography'', which the Bront\u00ebs owned and heavily annotated.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|Sellars|1995|p=68}}</ref>\n\n==== Lord Byron ====\nFrom 1833, Charlotte and Branwell's Angrian tales begin to feature [[Byron]]ic heroes who have a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrate arrogance and even black-heartedness. Again, it is in an article in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' from August 1825 that they discover the poet for the first time; he had died the previous year.

This lively tradition continued into the 19th&nbsp;century with the ''rags to riches'' genre to which almost all the great Victorian romancers have contributed.

The only options open to the girls were either marriage or a choice between the professions of school mistress or [[governess]]. The Bront\u00eb sisters found positions in families educating often rebellious young children, or employment as school teachers. The possibility of becoming a [[Lady's companion|paid companion]] to a rich and solitary woman might have been a fall-back role but one which would have bored any of the sisters intolerably. [[Janet Todd]]'s ''Mary Wollstonecraft, a revolutionary life'' mentions the predicament,<ref>Todd, Janet (2000), ''Mary Wollstonecraft, a revolutionary life'' London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Orion House.</ref> and none of the Bront\u00eb girls seems seriously to have considered a similar eventuality.\n\n[[File:Marian Hubbard Daisy Bell and Elsie May Bell with governess.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Governess in a rich English family in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century]]\nOnly Emily never became a governess.

On advice from her father and friends, she thought that she and her sisters had the intellectual capacity to create a school for young girls in the parsonage where their [[Sunday School]] classes took place. It was agreed to offer the future pupils the opportunity of correctly learning modern languages and that preparation for this should be done abroad, which led to a further decision. Among the possibilities Paris and Lille were considered,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaskell|1857|p=196}}</ref> but were rejected due to aversion to the French. Indeed, the [[Revolution|French revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] had not been forgotten by the [[Tory]] spirited and deeply conservative girls.<ref>Bensimon, Fabrice (2000) ''Les Britanniques face \u00e0 la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise de 1848'' (The British in the Face of the 1848 French Revolution) p.&nbsp;234</ref> On the recommendation of a pastor based in Brussels,<ref>Mr Jenkins, of the episcopat of Brussels {{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=363}}</ref> who wanted to be of help, Belgium was chosen, where they could also study German, and music.

Claire Heger was the second wife of Constantin, and it was she who founded and directed the school while Constantin had the responsibility for the higher French classes. According to Miss Wheelwright, a former pupil, he had the intellect of a genius. He was passionate about his auditorium, demanding many lectures, perspectives, and structured analyses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=414,&nbsp;418}}</ref> He was also a good-looking man with regular features, bushy hair, very black whiskers, and wore an excited expression while sounding forth on great authors about whom he invited his students to make a [[pastiche]] on general or philosophical themes.<ref name=\"Robertson Nicoll 1908, p.

After six months of study, Mme Heger suggested they stay at the boarding school free of charge, in return for giving some lessons. After much hesitation, the girls accepted. Neither of them felt particularly attached to their students, and only one, Mademoiselle de Bassompierre, then aged 16, later expressed any affection for her teacher, which in Emily's case appeared to be mutual, and made her a gift of a signed, detailed drawing of a storm ravaged<!--(tn) need to check with source which translation is best--> pine tree.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=394\u2013395}}</ref>\n\n==== Return and recall ====\nThe death of their aunt in October of the same year forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=409,&nbsp;449}}</ref> which had the immediate effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843,<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XXIII.</ref> while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the spirit of a man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.\n<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=392}}</ref>\n\n==== Charlotte returns ====\nAlmost a year to the day, enamoured already for some time of Monsieur Heger, Charlotte resigned and returned to Haworth. Her life there had not been without suffering, and on one occasion she ventured into the cathedral and entered a confessional. She may have had intention of converting to Catholicism, but it would only have been for a short time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=423\u2013424,&nbsp;429,&nbsp;695}}</ref>\n\nLife at Haworth had become more difficult during her absence. Mr. Bront\u00eb had lost his sight although his cataract had nevertheless been operated on with success in Manchester, and it was there in August 1846,<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XXVI.</ref> when Charlotte arrived at his bedside that she began to write ''Jane Eyre''. Meanwhile, her brother Branwell fell into a rapid decline punctuated by dramas, drunkenness, and delirium.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=544\u2013545,&nbsp;565\u2013568}}</ref> Due partly to Branwell's poor reputation, the school project failed and was abandoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=439\u2013440}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte wrote four long, very personal, and sometimes vague letters to [[Constantin Heger|Monsieur H\u00e9ger]] that never received replies. The extent of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's feelings for Heger were not fully realised until 1913, when her letters to him were published for the first time. Heger had first shown them to [[Elizabeth Gaskell|Mrs. Gaskell]] when she visited him in 1856 while researching her biography ''[[The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'', but she concealed their true significance. These letters, referred to as the \"Heger Letters\", had been ripped up at some stage by Heger, but his wife had retrieved the pieces from the wastepaper bin and meticulously glued or sewn them back together. Paul Heger, Constantin's son, and his sisters gave these letters to the [[British Museum]],<ref name=\"du Maurier 1987 240\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=440\u2013441,&nbsp;471\u2013472}}</ref> and they were shortly thereafter printed in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.<ref>''The Times'' 29 July 1913. Translated and with a commentary by [[Marion H. Spielmann]]</ref>\n\n==Bront\u00eb sisters' literary career==\n\n=== First publication: ''Poems'', by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell ===\n[[File:Bronte poems2.jpg|thumb|left|1846 issue of Bront\u00eb poems under the pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily) and Acton (Anne) Bell.]]\nThe writing that had begun so early never left the family. Charlotte had ambition like her brother (though Branwell was kept at a distance from her project) and wrote to the [[poet laureate]] [[Robert Southey]] to submit several poems of his style; she received a hardly encouraging reply after several months. Southey, still illustrious although his star has somewhat waned, was one of the great figures of English [[Romanticism]], with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and shared the prejudice of the times: literature, or more particularly poetry (for women had been publishing fiction and enjoying critical, popular and economic success for over a century by this time), was considered a man's business, and not an appropriate occupation for ladies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=262}}: \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation.\"</ref>\n\nHowever, Charlotte did not allow herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, coincidence came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone in the dining room she noticed a small notebook lying open in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and \"of my sister Emily's handwriting\". She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=478}}</ref> \"more than surprise ..., a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music \u2013 wild, melancholy, and elevating.\" In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bront\u00eb sisters' signatures as Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell.jpg|thumb|The only existing specimen of the three signatures of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell.]]\nCharlotte envisaged a joint publication by the three sisters. Anne was easily won over to the project, and the work was shared, compared, and edited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=478\u2013479,&nbsp;481,&nbsp;484}}</ref> Once the poems had been chosen, nineteen for Charlotte and twenty-one each for Anne and Emily, Charlotte went about searching for a publisher. She took advice from William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, directors of one of their favourite magazines, ''Chambers's Edinburgh Journal''. It is thought, although no documents exist to support the claim, that they advised the sisters to contact Aylott & Jones, a small publishing house at 8, Paternoster Row, London, who accepted but rather at the authors' own risk as they felt the commercial risk to the company was too great.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=484\u2013485}}</ref> The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male [[Pen name|pseudonyms]] of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily), and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon forenames but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls. It was in fact on 18 May 1845 that he took up his duties at Haworth, at the moment when the publication project was well advanced.\n\nThe book attracted hardly any attention. Only three copies were sold, of which one was purchased by Fredrick Enoch, a resident of Cornmarket, Warwick, who in admiration, wrote to the publisher to request an autograph \u2013 the only extant single document carrying the three author's signatures in their pseudonyms,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=499}}</ref> and they continued creating their prose, each one producing a book a year later. Each worked in secret,<ref>their father learned of the existence of ''Jane Eyre'' after its publication and exclaimed \"Charlotte's published a book and it's better than likely!\" {{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=546}}</ref> unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p.m. with \"Don't stay up late, girls!\", then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.<ref>Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum: ''Haworth Parsonage: home of the Bront\u00ebs, 1. The Entrance.''</ref>\n\n=== Fame ===\n[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|right| Title page of ''Jane Eyre'', edited by Currer Bell]]\n\n==== 1847 ====\nCharlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', appeared in 1847 after many tribulations, again for reasons of finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a new address and did this at least a dozen times during the year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=503}}</ref> The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder & Co in London, of which the 23-year-old owner George Smith had been specialised until then in publishing scientific revues aided by his perspicacious reader, William Smith Williams and remained faithful to the family. Those of Emily and Anne were confided to [[Thomas Cautley Newby]] who intended to compile a ''three-decker'', more economical for sale and for loan in the ''circulating libraries'' the two first volumes to include ''Wuthering Heights'' and the third one ''Agnes Grey''. Both the novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about ''Wuthering Heights'', praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality \u2013 surely, the critics wrote, a work of a man with a depraved mind<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=539\u2013542}}</ref> \u2013 fairly neutral about ''Agnes Grey'', more flattering for ''Jane Eyre'', which soon became what today would be called a [[best-seller]] - in spite of certain commentators denouncing it as an affront to morals and good mores.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=537\u2013539}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Jane Eyre'' and rising fame ====\n{{main|Jane Eyre}}\nThe pseudonymous (Currer Bell) publication in 1847 of ''Jane Eyre, An Autobiography'', established a dazzling reputation for Charlotte. In July 1848, Charlotte and Anne (Emily had refused to go along with them) travelled by train to London to prove to [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] that each sister was indeed an independent author, for Thomas Cautley Newby, the publisher of ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Agnes Grey'', had launched a rumour that the three novels were the work of one author, understood to be Ellis Bell (Emily). [[George Murray Smith|George Smith]] was extremely surprised to find two gawky, ill-dressed country girls paralysed with fear, who, to identify themselves, held out the letters addressed to ''Messrs. Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell''. Taken by such surprise, he introduced them to his mother with all the dignity their talent merited, and invited them to the opera for a performance of [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|pp=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Wuthering Heights'' ====\n{{main|Wuthering Heights}}\n{{related article|Agnes Grey}}\n[[File:TopWithens.jpg|thumb|right|Top Withens, the ruin on the moors near Haworth that inspired ''Wuthering Heights'']]\nEmily Bront\u00eb's ''Wuthering Heights'' was published in 1847 under the masculine pseudonym Ellis Bell, by Thomas Cautley Newby, in two companion volumes to that of Anne's (Acton Bell), ''[[Agnes Grey]].'' Controversial from the start of its release, its originality, its subject, narrative style and troubled action raised intrigue. Certain critics condemned it,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=90,&nbsp;91,&nbsp;533\u2013534,&nbsp;539\u2013540,&nbsp;653\u2013654}}</ref> but sales were nevertheless considerable for a novel from an unknown author and which defied all conventions.\n\nIt is a work of black Romanticism, covering three generations isolated in the cold or the spring of the countryside with two opposing elements: the dignified manor of Thrushcross Grange and the rambling dilapidated pile of Wuthering Heights. The main characters, swept by tumults of the earth, the skies and the hearts, are strange and often possessed of unheard of violence and deprivations. The story is told in a scholarly fashion, with two narrators, the traveller and tenant Lockwood, and the housekeeper/governess, Nelly Dean, with two sections in the first person, one direct, one cloaked, which overlap each other with digressions and sub-plots that form, from apparently scattered fragments, a coherently locked unit.\n\n==== 1848, Anne's ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' ====\n{{main|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall}}\n[[File:The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the original 1848 publication of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'', Anne Bront\u00eb's second novel (under the name of Acton Bell)]]\nOne year before her death in May 1849, Anne published a second novel. Far more ambitious than her previous novel, ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' was a great success and rapidly outsold Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. However, the critical reception was mixed \u2014 praise for the novel's \"power\" and \"effect\" and sharp criticism for being \"coarse\".

(For example, several decades before the Bront\u00eb sisters' experience at Cowan Bridge, [[Jane Austen]] and her sister Cassandra contracted typhus at a similar boarding school, and Jane nearly died. The Austen sisters' education, like that of the Bront\u00eb sisters, was continued at home.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=138}}</ref> Nevertheless, Charlotte blamed Cowan Bridge for her sisters' deaths, especially its poor medical care \u2013 chiefly, repeated emetics and blood-lettings \u2013 and the negligence of the school's doctor \u2013 who was the director's brother-in-law. Charlotte's vivid memories of the privations at Cowan Bridge were poured into her depiction of Lowood School in ''Jane Eyre'':  the scanty and at times spoiled food, the lack of heating and adequate clothing, the periodic epidemics of illness such as \"low fever\" (probably typhus), the severity and arbitrariness of the punishments, and even the harshness of particular teachers (a Miss Andrews who taught at Cowan Bridge is thought to have been Charlotte's model for Miss Scatcherd in ''Jane Eyre'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref> While [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], a personal friend and the first biographer of Charlotte, confirmed that Cowan Bridge was Charlotte's model for Lowood and insisted that conditions there in Charlotte's day were egregious, more recent biographers have argued that the food, clothing, heating, medical care, discipline, etc. at Cowan Bridge were not considered sub-standard for religious schools of the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=801\u2013808}}</ref> One scholar has even commended Patrick Bront\u00eb for his perspicacity in removing all his daughters from the school, a few weeks before the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=119\u2013127}}</ref>\n\n=== Literary encounters ===\nFollowing the overwhelming success of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Charlotte was pressured by George Smith, her publisher, to travel to London to meet her public.

[[Arthur Bell Nicholls]] (1818\u20131906) had been curate of Haworth for seven and a half years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Bront\u00eb (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded \"like all the curates\" \u2013 as she wrote to Ellen Nussey.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|page=358}}</ref> After she declined his proposal, Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Bront\u00eb, left his functions for several months.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|pages=358\u2013363, 378\u2013387, 358}}</ref> However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=758}}</ref>\n\nOn return from their honeymoon in Ireland where she had been introduced to Mr. Nicholls' aunt and cousins, her life completely changed. She adopted her new duties as a wife that took up most of her time, she wrote to her friends telling them that Nicholls was a good and attentive husband, but that she nevertheless felt a kind of holy terror at her new situation. In a letter to Ellen Nussey (Nell), in 1854 she wrote \"Indeed-indeed-Nell-it is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|page=400.}}</ref>\n\nThe following year she died aged 38. The cause of death given at the time was tuberculosis, but it may have been complicated with typhoid fever (the water at Haworth being likely contaminated due to poor sanitation and the vast cemetery that surrounded the church and the parsonage) and her pregnancy that was in its early stage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=769\u2013772}}</ref>\n\nThe first biography of Charlotte was written by [[Elizabeth Gaskell|Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell]] at the request of Patrick Bront\u00eb, and published in 1857, helping to create the myth of a family of condemned genius, living in a painful and romantic solitude. After having stayed at Haworth several times and having accommodated Charlotte in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, and become her friend and confidant, Mrs Gaskell had certainly had the advantage of knowing the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=651\u2013653, 681, 726\u2013728, 738\u2013741}}</ref>\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Jane Eyre (novel)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1847)\n* ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1849)\n* ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853)\n* ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' (1857)\n\n=== Unfinished fragments ===\nThese are outlines or unedited roughcasts which with the exception of ''Emma'' have been recently published.\n* ''Ashford'', written between 1840 and 1841, where certain characters from [[Glass Town|Angria]] are transported to Yorkshire and are included in a realistic plot.\n* ''Willie Ellin'', started after ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', and on which Charlotte worked relatively little in May and July 1853, is a story in three poorly linked parts in which the plot at this stage remains rather vague.\n* ''The Moores'' is an outline for two short chapters with two characters, the brothers Robert Moore, a dominator, and John Henry Moore, an intellectual fanatic.\n* ''Emma'', already published in 1860 with an introduction from [[Thackeray]].

The doctor confirmed that she was near to death and Anne thanked him for his candour. \"Take courage, take courage\" she murmured to Charlotte. She died at 2&nbsp;pm on Monday 18 May. She is buried in the cemetery of St Mary's of Scarborough.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=594\u2013595}}</ref> Her gravestone carried an error in her age in the inscription because she died at the age of 29 and not at 28. It was noticed by Charlotte during her only visit, and she had the intention of asking the mason to correct it. Ill health did not leave him time to effect the repair and the tombstone remained in the same state until replaced by the Bront\u00eb Society in April 2013.\n\n== Northern England at the time of the Bront\u00ebs ==\nIn her 1857 biography ''The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'', Mrs Gaskell begins with two explanatory and descriptive chapters. The first one covers the wild countryside of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the little village of Haworth, the parsonage and the church surrounded by its vast cemetery perched on the top of a hill. The second chapter presents an overview of the social, sanitary, and economic conditions of the region.\n\n=== Social, sanitary, and economic conditions in Haworth ===\nThe death toll within the Bront\u00eb family was not unusual and left little impression on the village population, who were confronted with death on a daily basis. When Patrick Bront\u00eb arrived, the parish was suffering from unemployment. The men sought work in the quarries and local handicrafts. The only businesses were the pharmacy which supplied Branwell, and John Greenwood's stationery store in which the Bront\u00ebs were the best customers.\n\nHaworth's population grew rapidly during the first half of the 18th&nbsp;century, from hardly 1,000 to 3,365 in 50 years.<ref>''The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth'', ''Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum'', Haworth 1820\u20131861, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The village did not have a sewage system and the well water was contaminated by faecal matter and the decomposition of bodies in the cemetery on the hilltop. Life expectancy was less than 25 years and infant mortality was around 41% of children under six months of age.<ref name=\"Haworth, 1861, p. 3\">''The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth'', ''Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum'', Haworth 1820\u20131861, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> Most of the population lived from working the poorly fertile land of the [[Moorland|moors]] and supplemented their incomes with work done at home, such as spinning and weaving wool from the sheep that were farmed on the moors.<ref name=\"Haworth, 1861, p. 3\"/> Conditions changed<ref>cf. the [[Luddites]] revolt and its consequences: {{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> and the textile industry, already present since the end of the 17th&nbsp;century, grew in the mills on the banks of the [[River Worth]], whose waters turned the wheels which consequently required fewer people to work them.\n\nFood was scarce, often little more than [[porridge]], resulting in vitamin deficiencies. Public hygiene was non-existent and lavatories were basic. The facilities at the parsonage were no more than a plank across a hole in a hut at the rear, with a lower plank for the children. In her thirties, Charlotte was described as having a toothless jaw, by such persons as Mrs Gaskell, who stated in a letter dated 25 August 1850 to Catherine Winkworth: \"large mouth and many teeth gone\".<ref>Margaret Smith, ''Letters'', volume II, letter 75, p.&nbsp;447.</ref> However, food was reasonable in the family. Well filled plates of porridge in the morning and piles of potatoes were peeled each day in the kitchen while Tabby told stories about her country or Emily revised her German grammar, and sometimes Mr Bront\u00eb would return home from his tours of the village with game donated by the parishioners.\n\n=== Role of the women ===\n[[File:P30b.jpg|thumb|right|Jane Eyre, pleading her case to her aunt, Mrs Reed, before she sends her to hard service at Lowood (second edition of ''Jane Eyre'', 1847)]]\n\nAccording to [[Robert Southey]], poet laureate, in his response to Charlotte, ladies from a good background should be content with an education and a marriage embellished with some decorative talents.<ref name=\"Gaskill 123\"/> Mr Bront\u00eb also said to one of the characters in his ''The Maid of Kilarney'', without one knowing whether it truly reflected a widespread opinion in order to support it or to condemn it: \"The education of female ought, most assuredly, to be competent, in order that she might enjoy herself, and be a fit companion for man. But, believe me, lovely, delicate and sprightly woman, is not formed by nature, to pore over the musty pages of Grecian and Roman literature, or to plod through the windings of Mathematical Problems, nor has Providence assigned for her sphere of action, either the cabinet or the field. Her ''forte'' is softness, tenderness and grace.\" In any case, it seemed to contradict his attitude towards his daughters whom he encouraged even if he was not completely aware of what they did with their time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=117}}</ref>\n\n== Sisters' place in literature ==\nDue to their forced or voluntary isolation, the Bront\u00eb sisters constituted a separate literary group which neither had predecessors nor successors. There is not a 'Bront\u00eb' line such as exists among authors of realist and naturalist novels, and in poetry, the romantic, and the symbolic.\n\nTheir influence certainly existed but it is difficult to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as [[Thomas Hardy]] in ''Jude the Obscure'' or ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'', or [[George Eliot]] with ''Adam Bede'' and ''The Mill on the Floss''. There were also more conventional authors such as [[Matthew Arnold]], who in a letter from 1853 says of Charlotte that she only pretends to heartless: \"nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=134}}</ref> In contrast, [[Mrs Humphry Ward]], author of ''Robert Elsmere'' and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily.<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=135}}</ref> There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.\n\n=== Pilgrimages to Haworth from 1860 ===\nBy 1860 Charlotte had been dead for five years, and the only people living at the parsonage were Mr. Bront\u00eb, his son-in-law, [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte was published, and though Mr. Bront\u00eb at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing and she had to struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters \u2013 although this never actually happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=766\u2013767,&nbsp;773,&nbsp;780,&nbsp;790\u2013791,&nbsp;806}}</ref>\n\nMrs. Gaskell's book caused a sensation and was distributed nationwide. The polemic launched by Charlotte's father resulted in a squabble that only served to increase the family's fame.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=819\u2013820,&nbsp;822\u2013823}}</ref>\n\nDuring Charlotte's lifetime friends and sponsors visited the parsonage, including [[James J. Shuttleworth|Sir James]] and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, [[Ellen Nussey]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[John Store Smith]], a young writer from Manchester, [[Bessie Parkes]], who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and [[Abraham Holroyd]], poet, antiquarian, and historian.<ref name=\"Lemon\">{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Lemon|title=Early Visitors to Haworth, from Ellen Nussey to Virginia Woolf|year= 1996|page={{page needed|date=July 2014}}|publisher=Bront\u00eb Society|isbn=9780950582962}}</ref> However, following the publication of the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Bront\u00eb girls.<ref name=\"Lemon\"/> The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic.

The sisters, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] (1816\u20131855), [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]] (1818\u20131848), and [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]] (1820\u20131849), are well known as poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they originally published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories immediately attracted attention for their passion and originality. Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' was the first to know success, while Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', Anne's ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' and other works were later to be accepted as masterpieces of literature.\n\nThe three sisters and their brother, [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]] (1817\u20131848), were very close and during childhood developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set therein.\n\nThe deaths of first their mother, and then of their two older sisters marked them profoundly and influenced their writing, as did the relative isolation in which they were raised.\n\nThe Bront\u00eb birthplace in [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the [[parsonage]] at [[Haworth]] in Yorkshire, now the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum]], welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n== Origin of the name 1830\u20131852 ==\nThe Bront\u00eb family can be traced to the [[Irish clan]] ''\u00d3 Pronntaigh'', which literally means \"descendant of Pronntach\". They were a family of hereditary scribes and literary men in [[Fermanagh]]. The version \u00d3 Proinntigh, which was first given Patrick Woulfe in his ''Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall'' (Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner)<ref name=PW>Woulfe, Patrick, '' Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall: Irish names and Surnames'' (Baile Atha Cliath: M. H. Gill, 1922), p. 79</ref> and reproduced without question by MacLysaght ''inter alia'', cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries and all of them used the spelling \u00d3 Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word ''pronntach'' or ''bronntach'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?Fuzzy=0&cv=1&searchtext=(id%20contains%20B)%20and%20(column%20contains%20202)&sortField=ID&sortDIR=65602&respage=0&resperpage=10&bhcp=1|title=Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=22 January 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref> which is related to the word ''bronnadh'', meaning giving or bestowal (''pronn'' is given as an Ulster version of ''bronn'' in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.)<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Edward|title=An Irish\u2013English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jmk9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT382&lpg=PT382&dq=pronnaim#v=onepage|year=1821}}</ref> The author of ''Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall'', suggested that it was derived from ''proinnteach'' (the refectory of a monastery).<ref name=PW/> ''\u00d3 Pronntaigh'' was earlier [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as ''Prunty'' and sometimes ''Brunty''.\n\nAt some point, the father of the sisters, [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]] (born Brunty), decided on the alternative spelling with the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over the terminal ''e'' to indicate that the name has two syllables. It is not known for certain what motivated him to do so, and multiple theories exist to account for the change. He may have wished to hide his humble origins.<ref name=Haworth/> As a [[man of letters]], he would have been familiar with [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]] and may have chosen the name after the Greek [[wikt:\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae|\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae]] (\"thunder\").

She left memories with her husband and with Charlotte, the oldest surviving sibling, of a very vivacious woman at the parsonage. The younger ones, particularly Emily and Anne, admitted to retaining only vague images of their mother, especially of her suffering on her sickbed.\n\n=== Elizabeth Branwell ===\n{{main|Elizabeth Branwell}}\nElizabeth Branwell (2 December 1776 \u2013 29 October 1842) arrived from Penzance in 1821, aged 45, after the death of Maria, her younger sister, to help Patrick look after the children, and was known as 'Aunt Branwell'. Elizabeth Branwell, who raised the children after the death of their mother, was a Methodist. It seems, nevertheless, that her denomination did not exert any influence on the children. It was Aunt Branwell who taught the children arithmetic, the alphabet, how to sew,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=17}}</ref> embroidery and cross-stitching appropriate for ladies. Aunt Branwell also gave them books and subscribed to ''Fraser's Magazine'', less interesting than ''Blackwood's'', but, nevertheless, providing plenty of material for discussion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=179}}</ref> She was a generous person who dedicated her life to her nieces and nephew, neither marrying nor returning to visit her relations in Cornwall.\nShe died of [[bowel obstruction]] in October 1842, after a brief agony, comforted by her beloved nephew Branwell. In her last will, Aunt Branwell left to her three nieces the considerable sum of  \u00a3900 (about \u00a395,700 in 2017 currency), which allowed them to resign their low-paid jobs as governesses and teachers.\n\n=== Children ===\n[[File:Bronte Parsonage Museum.JPG|thumb|The parsonage in Haworth, the former family home, is now the ''[[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum]]''.]]\n\n[[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]] (1814\u20131825), the eldest, was born in Clough House, High Town, on 23 April 1814.  She suffered from hunger, cold, and privation at [[Cowan Bridge School]]. Charlotte described her as very lively, very sensitive, and particularly advanced in her reading. She returned from school with an advanced case of [[tuberculosis]] and died at Haworth at the age of 11 on 6 May 1825.\n\n[[Elizabeth Bront\u00eb|Elizabeth]] (1815\u20131825), the second child, joined her sister Maria at Cowan Bridge where she suffered the same fate. Elizabeth was less vivacious than her brother and her sisters and apparently less advanced for her age. She died on 15 June 1825 at the age of 10, within two weeks of returning home to her father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=25}}</ref>\n\n[[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] (1816\u20131855), born in Market Street [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], near [[Bradford]], West Riding of Yorkshire, on 21 April 1816, was a poet and novelist and is the author of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', her best known work, and three other novels. She died on 31 March 1855 just before reaching the age of 39.\n\n[[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Patrick Branwell]] (1817\u20131848) was born in Market Street Thornton on 26 June 1817. Known as ''Branwell'', he was a painter, writer and casual worker. He became addicted to alcohol and [[laudanum]] and died at Haworth on 24 September 1848 at the age of 31.\n\n[[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily Jane]] (1818\u20131848), born in Market Street Thornton, 30 July 1818, was a poet and novelist. She died in Haworth on 19 December 1848 at the age of 30.  ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' was her only novel.\n\n[[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]] (1820\u20131849), born in Market Street Thornton on 17 January 1820, was a poet and novelist. She wrote a largely autobiographical novel entitled ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', but her second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848), was far more ambitious. She died on 28 May 1849 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] at the age of 29.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Cowan Bridge School ===\nIn 1824, the four eldest girls (excluding Anne) entered the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge]],<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XVI.</ref> which educated the children of less prosperous members of the clergy, which had been recommended to Mr Bront\u00eb. The following year, Maria and Elizabeth fell gravely ill and were removed from the school, but died shortly afterwards within a few weeks of each other on 6 May and 15 June 1825.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=137\u2013139}}</ref> Charlotte and Emily were also withdrawn from the school and returned to Haworth. The loss of their sisters was a trauma that showed in Charlotte's writing. In ''Jane Eyre'', Cowan Bridge becomes Lowood, Maria is represented by the character of the young Helen Burns, the cruelty of the mistress Miss Andrews by that of Miss Scatcherd, and the tyranny of the headmaster, the [[William Carus Wilson|Rev. Carus Wilson]], by that of Mr Brocklehurst.\n\nTuberculosis, which afflicted Maria and Elizabeth in 1825, was the eventual cause of death of three of the surviving Bront\u00ebs: Branwell in September 1848, Emily in December 1848, and finally, Anne five months later in May 1849.\n\nPatrick Bront\u00eb faced a challenge in arranging for the education of the girls of his family, which was barely middle class. They had no significant connections and he could not afford the fees for them to attend an established school for young ladies. One solution was the schools where the fees were reduced to a minimum \u2013 so called \"charity schools\" \u2013 with a mission to assist families such as those of the lower clergy. One cannot accuse Mr. Bront\u00eb of not having done everything possible to find a solution that he thought would be best for his daughters. As Barker comments, he had read in the ''Leeds Intelligencer'' of 6 November 1823 the reports of cases in the Court of Commons in Bowes, and he later read other cases decided on 24 November 1824 near Richmond, two towns in the county of Yorkshire, where pupils had been discovered gnawed by rats and suffering from malnutrition to the extent that some of them had lost their sight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=119}}</ref> There was nothing to suggest that the Reverend Carus Wilson's Clergy Daughters' School would not provide a good education and good care for his daughters. The school was not expensive, and its patrons (supporters who allowed the school to use their names) were all respected people, including the daughter of Hannah Moore, an author of recognised works and a close friend of the poet [[William Cowper]], both proponents of a correct education for young girls; and the offspring of different prelates and even certain acquaintances of Patrick Bront\u00eb including [[William Wilberforce]], young women whose fathers had also been educated at St John's College, Cambridge.  Thus Bront\u00eb believed Wilson's school to have a number of the necessary guarantees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n=== John Bradley ===\n{{main|John Bradley (d. 1844)}}\nIn 1829\u201330, Patrick Bront\u00eb engaged [[John Bradley (d. 1844)|John Bradley]], an artist from neighbouring [[Keighley]], as drawing-master for the children. Bradley was an artist of some local repute, rather than a professional instructor, but he may well have fostered Branwell's enthusiasm for art and architecture.<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{harvnb|Alexander|Sellars|1995|pp=23\u201324, 33.}}</ref>\n\n=== Miss Wooler's school ===\n[[File:Roe Head, Mirfield - geograph.org.uk - 55901.jpg|thumb|left|Roe Head, Mirfield, Miss Wooler's school]]\n[[File:CharlotteBronte.jpg|thumb|upright|Disputed photograph taken about 1855; sources are in disagreement over whether this image is of Charlotte Bront\u00eb or of her friend, [[Ellen Nussey]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1613719.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194617/http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1613719.ece |archivedate=4 March 2016|title=To walk invisible |publisher=TLS |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brontesisters.co.uk/Photo-of-Charlotte-Bronte.html|title=The Bronte Sisters \u2013 A True Likeness? \u2013 Photo of Charlotte Bronte|website=Brontesisters.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>]]\n[[File:ellennussey1855.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ellen Nussey]] around 1855, at the time of the death of Charlotte.]]\n[[File:Bront\u00eb Letter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A letter from Charlotte Bront\u00eb to her friend, [[Ellen Nussey]]<ref group=\"N\">In this letter dated 21 April 1844, the day of her 28th birthday, she thanks her friend Nell for the gift, returns the gesture by sending her some lace: \"I hope\" she adds \"they will not peck it out of the envelope at the Bradford Post-office, where they generally take the liberty of opening letters when they feel soft as if they contained articles\".</ref>]]\n\nIn 1831, 14-year-old Charlotte was enrolled at the school of Miss Wooler in Roe Head, [[Mirfield]]. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in [[Keighley]] nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation and he remembered the building which he passed when strolling around the parishes of [[Kirklees]], [[Dewsbury]], and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=757\u2013758}}</ref><ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XVII.</ref> Patrick's choice of school was excellent \u2013 Charlotte was happy there and studied well.

The family decided that Emily would accompany her to pursue studies that would otherwise have been unaffordable. Emily's fees were partly covered by Charlotte's salary. Emily was 17 and it was the first time she had left Haworth since leaving Cowan Bridge. On 29 July 1835, the sisters left for Roe Head. The same day, Branwell wrote a letter to the [[Royal Academy of Art]] in London, to present several of his drawings as part of his candidature as a probationary student.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=224\u2013226}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte taught, and wrote about her students without much sympathy. Emily did not settle and after three months she seemed to decline and had to be taken home to the parsonage. Anne took her place and stayed until Christmas 1837.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=235\u2013237}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte avoided boredom by following the development of Angria which she received in letters from her brother. During holidays at Haworth, she wrote long narratives while being reproached by her father who wanted her to become more involved in parish affairs. These were coming to a head over the imposition of the Church rates, a local tax levied on parishes where the majority of the population were dissenters. In the meantime, Miss Wooler moved to Heald's House, at [[Dewsbury Moor]], where Charlotte complained about the humidity that made her unwell. Upon leaving the establishment in 1838 Miss Wooler presented her with a parting gift of  ''The Vision of Don Roderick and Rokeby'', a collection of poems by [[Walter Scott]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=238\u2013291}}</ref>\n\n== Literary evolution ==\nThe children became interested in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was the younger ones whose pastime it became to develop them. At the centre of the children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Bront\u00eb gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826.<ref name=\"Smith 28\">{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=28}}</ref> These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as ''the Young Men'', and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5F_n_qxvHSYC&pg=PA77&dq=gondal+angria+glass+town+bront%C3%AB&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA75,M1 David W. Harrison, ''The Brontes of Haworth'' pp.&nbsp;75\u201376.].</ref> and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=29}}</ref> followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]], an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831.<ref name=\"Smith 30\">{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|p=30}}</ref> In the beginning, these stories were written in ''little books'', the size of a matchbox {{nowrap|(about 1.5 x 2.5 inches\u20143.8 x 6.4&nbsp;cm)}},<ref name=\"Smith 30\"/> and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed,<ref name=\"Smith 28\"/> or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.\n\n=== Literary and artistic influence ===\nThese fictional worlds were the product of fertile imagination fed by reading, discussion, and a passion for literature. Far from suffering from the negative influences that never left them and which were reflected in the works of their later, more mature years, the Bront\u00eb children absorbed them with open arms.\n\n==== Press ====\nThe periodicals that Patrick Bront\u00eb read were a mine of information for his children. The ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'' and ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', conservative and well written, but better than the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' that defended the same political ideas whilst addressing a less refined readership (the reason Mr. Bront\u00eb did not read it),<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=105}}</ref> were exploited in every detail. ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in particular, was not only the source of their knowledge of world affairs, but also provided material for the Bront\u00ebs' early writing.  For instance, an article in the June 1826 number of ''Blackwood\u2019s'', provides commentary on new discoveries from the exploration of [[central Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=James |last=Macqueen|title= Geography of Central Africa. Denham and Clapperton's Journals|journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine|volume= 19:113 |date=June 1826|pages =pp.&nbsp;687\u2013709}}</ref>   The map included with the article highlights geographical features the Bront\u00ebs reference in their tales: the Jibbel Kumera (the [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]]), [[Ashantee]], and the rivers [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Calabar River|Calabar]].  The author also advises the British to expand into Africa from Fernando Po, where, Christine Alexander notes, the Bront\u00eb children locate the Great Glass Town.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christine |last=Alexander|title=The Early Writings of Charlotte Bront\u00eb|location =Oxford|publisher= Blackwell|year= 1983| page= 30}}</ref>  Their knowledge of geography was completed by Goldsmith's ''Grammar of General Geography'', which the Bront\u00ebs owned and heavily annotated.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|Sellars|1995|p=68}}</ref>\n\n==== Lord Byron ====\nFrom 1833, Charlotte and Branwell's Angrian tales begin to feature [[Byron]]ic heroes who have a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrate arrogance and even black-heartedness. Again, it is in an article in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' from August 1825 that they discover the poet for the first time; he had died the previous year. From this moment, the name Byron became synonymous with all the prohibitions and audacities as if it had stirred up the very essence of the rise of those forbidden things.<ref>G\u00e9rin, Winifred (1966) ''Byron's influence on the Bront\u00ebs'', ''Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulletin'', 17.</ref> Branwell's Charlotte Zamorna, one of the heroes of ''[[Verdopolis]]'', tends towards increasingly ambiguous behaviour,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=odBIxjAhjbsC&pg=PA23&dq=branwell+zamorna+byron#PPA23,M1 |first=Christine Anne|last= Alexander|first2= Juliet |last2=McMaster|title=The child writer from Austen to Woolf|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|page=23|isbn=9780521812931}}</ref> and the same influence and evolution recur with the Bront\u00ebs, especially in the characters of [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and [[Mr. Rochester]] in  ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', who display the traits of a [[Byronic hero]]. Numerous other works have left their mark on the Bront\u00ebs\u2014the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' for example, which inspired [[Genie|jinn]] in which they became themselves in the centre of their kingdoms, while adding a touch of exoticism.\n\n==== John Martin ====\n[[File:John Martin Le Pandemonium Louvre.JPG|thumb|The fantasy architecture of [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]: ''[[Pand\u00e6monium (Paradise Lost)|Pandemonium]]'', inspired by [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' ([[Louvre Museum]]).]]\nThe children's imagination was also influenced by three prints of engravings in [[mezzotint]] by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] around 1820. Charlotte and Branwell made copies of the prints ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Martin painting)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', ''D\u00e9luge'', and ''Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still upon Gibeon'' (1816), which hung on the walls of the parsonage.<ref name=\"Glen 168\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSyPB18b6xgC&pg=PA168&dq=bront%C3%AB+%22Belshazzar's+Feast+%22#PPA169,M1|title=Charlotte Bront\u00eb: The Imagination in History|first=Heather|last=Glen|date=18 March 2004|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199272556}}</ref>\n\nMartin's fantastic architecture is reflected in the [[Glass Town]] and Angrian writings, where he appears himself among Branwell's characters<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=alnioqtRTg4C&pg=PA63&dq=bront%C3%AB+%22edward+de+lisle%22&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES Patrick Branwell Bront\u00eb, Victor A.

This lively tradition continued into the 19th&nbsp;century with the ''rags to riches'' genre to which almost all the great Victorian romancers have contributed. The protagonist is thrown by fate into poverty and after many difficulties achieves a golden happiness. Often an artifice is employed to effect the passage from one state to another such as an unexpected inheritance, a miraculous gift, grand reunions, etc.<ref group=\"N\">See ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', ''[[Great Expectations]]'', just to mention Charles Dickens</ref> and in a sense, it is the route followed by Charlotte's and Anne's protagonists, even if the riches they win are more those of the heart than of the wallet.

The only options open to the girls were either marriage or a choice between the professions of school mistress or [[governess]]. The Bront\u00eb sisters found positions in families educating often rebellious young children, or employment as school teachers. The possibility of becoming a [[Lady's companion|paid companion]] to a rich and solitary woman might have been a fall-back role but one which would have bored any of the sisters intolerably. [[Janet Todd]]'s ''Mary Wollstonecraft, a revolutionary life'' mentions the predicament,<ref>Todd, Janet (2000), ''Mary Wollstonecraft, a revolutionary life'' London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Orion House.</ref> and none of the Bront\u00eb girls seems seriously to have considered a similar eventuality.\n\n[[File:Marian Hubbard Daisy Bell and Elsie May Bell with governess.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Governess in a rich English family in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century]]\nOnly Emily never became a governess.

On advice from her father and friends, she thought that she and her sisters had the intellectual capacity to create a school for young girls in the parsonage where their [[Sunday School]] classes took place. It was agreed to offer the future pupils the opportunity of correctly learning modern languages and that preparation for this should be done abroad, which led to a further decision. Among the possibilities Paris and Lille were considered,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaskell|1857|p=196}}</ref> but were rejected due to aversion to the French.

Claire Heger was the second wife of Constantin, and it was she who founded and directed the school while Constantin had the responsibility for the higher French classes. According to Miss Wheelwright, a former pupil, he had the intellect of a genius. He was passionate about his auditorium, demanding many lectures, perspectives, and structured analyses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=414,&nbsp;418}}</ref> He was also a good-looking man with regular features, bushy hair, very black whiskers, and wore an excited expression while sounding forth on great authors about whom he invited his students to make a [[pastiche]] on general or philosophical themes.<ref name=\"Robertson Nicoll 1908, p.

After six months of study, Mme Heger suggested they stay at the boarding school free of charge, in return for giving some lessons. After much hesitation, the girls accepted. Neither of them felt particularly attached to their students, and only one, Mademoiselle de Bassompierre, then aged 16, later expressed any affection for her teacher, which in Emily's case appeared to be mutual, and made her a gift of a signed, detailed drawing of a storm ravaged<!--(tn) need to check with source which translation is best--> pine tree.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=394\u2013395}}</ref>\n\n==== Return and recall ====\nThe death of their aunt in October of the same year forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=409,&nbsp;449}}</ref> which had the immediate effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843,<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XXIII.</ref> while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the spirit of a man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.\n<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=392}}</ref>\n\n==== Charlotte returns ====\nAlmost a year to the day, enamoured already for some time of Monsieur Heger, Charlotte resigned and returned to Haworth. Her life there had not been without suffering, and on one occasion she ventured into the cathedral and entered a confessional. She may have had intention of converting to Catholicism, but it would only have been for a short time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=423\u2013424,&nbsp;429,&nbsp;695}}</ref>\n\nLife at Haworth had become more difficult during her absence. Mr. Bront\u00eb had lost his sight although his cataract had nevertheless been operated on with success in Manchester, and it was there in August 1846,<ref>Nicoll, W. Robertson (1908) ''The Complete Poems of Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Introductory Essay'', p.&nbsp;XXVI.</ref> when Charlotte arrived at his bedside that she began to write ''Jane Eyre''. Meanwhile, her brother Branwell fell into a rapid decline punctuated by dramas, drunkenness, and delirium.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=544\u2013545,&nbsp;565\u2013568}}</ref> Due partly to Branwell's poor reputation, the school project failed and was abandoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=439\u2013440}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte wrote four long, very personal, and sometimes vague letters to [[Constantin Heger|Monsieur H\u00e9ger]] that never received replies. The extent of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's feelings for Heger were not fully realised until 1913, when her letters to him were published for the first time. Heger had first shown them to [[Elizabeth Gaskell|Mrs. Gaskell]] when she visited him in 1856 while researching her biography ''[[The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'', but she concealed their true significance. These letters, referred to as the \"Heger Letters\", had been ripped up at some stage by Heger, but his wife had retrieved the pieces from the wastepaper bin and meticulously glued or sewn them back together. Paul Heger, Constantin's son, and his sisters gave these letters to the [[British Museum]],<ref name=\"du Maurier 1987 240\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=440\u2013441,&nbsp;471\u2013472}}</ref> and they were shortly thereafter printed in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.<ref>''The Times'' 29 July 1913. Translated and with a commentary by [[Marion H. Spielmann]]</ref>\n\n==Bront\u00eb sisters' literary career==\n\n=== First publication: ''Poems'', by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell ===\n[[File:Bronte poems2.jpg|thumb|left|1846 issue of Bront\u00eb poems under the pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily) and Acton (Anne) Bell.]]\nThe writing that had begun so early never left the family. Charlotte had ambition like her brother (though Branwell was kept at a distance from her project) and wrote to the [[poet laureate]] [[Robert Southey]] to submit several poems of his style; she received a hardly encouraging reply after several months. Southey, still illustrious although his star has somewhat waned, was one of the great figures of English [[Romanticism]], with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and shared the prejudice of the times: literature, or more particularly poetry (for women had been publishing fiction and enjoying critical, popular and economic success for over a century by this time), was considered a man's business, and not an appropriate occupation for ladies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=262}}: \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation.\"</ref>\n\nHowever, Charlotte did not allow herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, coincidence came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone in the dining room she noticed a small notebook lying open in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and \"of my sister Emily's handwriting\". She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=478}}</ref> \"more than surprise ..., a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music \u2013 wild, melancholy, and elevating.\" In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bront\u00eb sisters' signatures as Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell.jpg|thumb|The only existing specimen of the three signatures of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell.]]\nCharlotte envisaged a joint publication by the three sisters. Anne was easily won over to the project, and the work was shared, compared, and edited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=478\u2013479,&nbsp;481,&nbsp;484}}</ref> Once the poems had been chosen, nineteen for Charlotte and twenty-one each for Anne and Emily, Charlotte went about searching for a publisher. She took advice from William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, directors of one of their favourite magazines, ''Chambers's Edinburgh Journal''. It is thought, although no documents exist to support the claim, that they advised the sisters to contact Aylott & Jones, a small publishing house at 8, Paternoster Row, London, who accepted but rather at the authors' own risk as they felt the commercial risk to the company was too great.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=484\u2013485}}</ref> The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male [[Pen name|pseudonyms]] of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily), and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon forenames but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls. It was in fact on 18 May 1845 that he took up his duties at Haworth, at the moment when the publication project was well advanced.\n\nThe book attracted hardly any attention. Only three copies were sold, of which one was purchased by Fredrick Enoch, a resident of Cornmarket, Warwick, who in admiration, wrote to the publisher to request an autograph \u2013 the only extant single document carrying the three author's signatures in their pseudonyms,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=499}}</ref> and they continued creating their prose, each one producing a book a year later. Each worked in secret,<ref>their father learned of the existence of ''Jane Eyre'' after its publication and exclaimed \"Charlotte's published a book and it's better than likely!\" {{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=546}}</ref> unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p.m. with \"Don't stay up late, girls!\", then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.<ref>Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum: ''Haworth Parsonage: home of the Bront\u00ebs, 1. The Entrance.''</ref>\n\n=== Fame ===\n[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|right| Title page of ''Jane Eyre'', edited by Currer Bell]]\n\n==== 1847 ====\nCharlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', appeared in 1847 after many tribulations, again for reasons of finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a new address and did this at least a dozen times during the year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=503}}</ref> The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder & Co in London, of which the 23-year-old owner George Smith had been specialised until then in publishing scientific revues aided by his perspicacious reader, William Smith Williams and remained faithful to the family. Those of Emily and Anne were confided to [[Thomas Cautley Newby]] who intended to compile a ''three-decker'', more economical for sale and for loan in the ''circulating libraries'' the two first volumes to include ''Wuthering Heights'' and the third one ''Agnes Grey''. Both the novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about ''Wuthering Heights'', praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality \u2013 surely, the critics wrote, a work of a man with a depraved mind<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=539\u2013542}}</ref> \u2013 fairly neutral about ''Agnes Grey'', more flattering for ''Jane Eyre'', which soon became what today would be called a [[best-seller]] - in spite of certain commentators denouncing it as an affront to morals and good mores.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=537\u2013539}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Jane Eyre'' and rising fame ====\n{{main|Jane Eyre}}\nThe pseudonymous (Currer Bell) publication in 1847 of ''Jane Eyre, An Autobiography'', established a dazzling reputation for Charlotte. In July 1848, Charlotte and Anne (Emily had refused to go along with them) travelled by train to London to prove to [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] that each sister was indeed an independent author, for Thomas Cautley Newby, the publisher of ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Agnes Grey'', had launched a rumour that the three novels were the work of one author, understood to be Ellis Bell (Emily). [[George Murray Smith|George Smith]] was extremely surprised to find two gawky, ill-dressed country girls paralysed with fear, who, to identify themselves, held out the letters addressed to ''Messrs. Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell''. Taken by such surprise, he introduced them to his mother with all the dignity their talent merited, and invited them to the opera for a performance of [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith Kenyon|2002|pp=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Wuthering Heights'' ====\n{{main|Wuthering Heights}}\n{{related article|Agnes Grey}}\n[[File:TopWithens.jpg|thumb|right|Top Withens, the ruin on the moors near Haworth that inspired ''Wuthering Heights'']]\nEmily Bront\u00eb's ''Wuthering Heights'' was published in 1847 under the masculine pseudonym Ellis Bell, by Thomas Cautley Newby, in two companion volumes to that of Anne's (Acton Bell), ''[[Agnes Grey]].'' Controversial from the start of its release, its originality, its subject, narrative style and troubled action raised intrigue. Certain critics condemned it,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=90,&nbsp;91,&nbsp;533\u2013534,&nbsp;539\u2013540,&nbsp;653\u2013654}}</ref> but sales were nevertheless considerable for a novel from an unknown author and which defied all conventions.\n\nIt is a work of black Romanticism, covering three generations isolated in the cold or the spring of the countryside with two opposing elements: the dignified manor of Thrushcross Grange and the rambling dilapidated pile of Wuthering Heights. The main characters, swept by tumults of the earth, the skies and the hearts, are strange and often possessed of unheard of violence and deprivations. The story is told in a scholarly fashion, with two narrators, the traveller and tenant Lockwood, and the housekeeper/governess, Nelly Dean, with two sections in the first person, one direct, one cloaked, which overlap each other with digressions and sub-plots that form, from apparently scattered fragments, a coherently locked unit.\n\n==== 1848, Anne's ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' ====\n{{main|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall}}\n[[File:The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the original 1848 publication of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'', Anne Bront\u00eb's second novel (under the name of Acton Bell)]]\nOne year before her death in May 1849, Anne published a second novel. Far more ambitious than her previous novel, ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' was a great success and rapidly outsold Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. However, the critical reception was mixed \u2014 praise for the novel's \"power\" and \"effect\" and sharp criticism for being \"coarse\". [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] herself, Anne's sister, wrote to her publisher that it \"hardly seems to me desirable to {{nowrap|preserve ... the}} choice of subject in that work is a mistake.\"<ref name=\"Barker 654\">{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=654}}</ref> After Anne's death, Charlotte prevented the novel's republication and thus condemned her sister to temporary oblivion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annebrontescarborough.co.uk/ |title=Anne Bront\u00eb Remembered in Scarborough|accessdate=23 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101041427/http://www.scarborough.co.uk/annebronte/index.htm|archivedate=1 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe master theme is the alcoholism of a man who causes the downfall of his family.

She is forced to break with the conventions that keep her in the family home that has become hell, and to leave with her child to seek secret refuge in the old house of Wildfell Hall. When the alcohol causes her husband's ultimate decline, she returns to care for him in total abnegation until his death.\n\nToday, ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' is considered by most of the critics to be one of the first sustained [[Feminism|feminist]] novels.<ref name=\"intro\">{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Stevie|title=The Tenant of Wildfell Hall|chapter=Introduction and Notes|year=1996|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-043474-3|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/tenantofwildfell00bron|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tenantofwildfell00bron}}</ref>\n\n== Charlotte Bront\u00eb ==\n{{main|Charlotte Bront\u00eb}}\n[[File:Charlotte Bront\u00eb 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Charlotte Bront\u00eb, probably by George Richmond (1850)]]\n\n=== Denunciation of boarding schools (''Jane Eyre'') ===\nConditions at the school at Cowan Bridge, where Maria and Elizabeth may have contracted the tuberculosis from which they died, were probably no worse than those at many other schools of the time. (For example, several decades before the Bront\u00eb sisters' experience at Cowan Bridge, [[Jane Austen]] and her sister Cassandra contracted typhus at a similar boarding school, and Jane nearly died. The Austen sisters' education, like that of the Bront\u00eb sisters, was continued at home.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=138}}</ref> Nevertheless, Charlotte blamed Cowan Bridge for her sisters' deaths, especially its poor medical care \u2013 chiefly, repeated emetics and blood-lettings \u2013 and the negligence of the school's doctor \u2013 who was the director's brother-in-law. Charlotte's vivid memories of the privations at Cowan Bridge were poured into her depiction of Lowood School in ''Jane Eyre'':  the scanty and at times spoiled food, the lack of heating and adequate clothing, the periodic epidemics of illness such as \"low fever\" (probably typhus), the severity and arbitrariness of the punishments, and even the harshness of particular teachers (a Miss Andrews who taught at Cowan Bridge is thought to have been Charlotte's model for Miss Scatcherd in ''Jane Eyre'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref> While [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], a personal friend and the first biographer of Charlotte, confirmed that Cowan Bridge was Charlotte's model for Lowood and insisted that conditions there in Charlotte's day were egregious, more recent biographers have argued that the food, clothing, heating, medical care, discipline, etc. at Cowan Bridge were not considered sub-standard for religious schools of the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=801\u2013808}}</ref> One scholar has even commended Patrick Bront\u00eb for his perspicacity in removing all his daughters from the school, a few weeks before the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=119\u2013127}}</ref>\n\n=== Literary encounters ===\nFollowing the overwhelming success of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Charlotte was pressured by George Smith, her publisher, to travel to London to meet her public. Despite the extreme timidity that paralysed her among strangers and made her almost incapable of expressing herself,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=643\u2013644}}</ref> Charlotte consented to be lionised, and in London was introduced to other great writers of the era, including [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], who both befriended her. Charlotte especially admired [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], whose portrait, given to her by Smith, still hangs in the dining room at Haworth parsonage.<ref>''The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth'', Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum, section 3, ''The Dining Room'', illustration 5.

[[Arthur Bell Nicholls]] (1818\u20131906) had been curate of Haworth for seven and a half years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Bront\u00eb (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded \"like all the curates\" \u2013 as she wrote to Ellen Nussey.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|page=358}}</ref> After she declined his proposal, Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Bront\u00eb, left his functions for several months.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|pages=358\u2013363, 378\u2013387, 358}}</ref> However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=758}}</ref>\n\nOn return from their honeymoon in Ireland where she had been introduced to Mr. Nicholls' aunt and cousins, her life completely changed. She adopted her new duties as a wife that took up most of her time, she wrote to her friends telling them that Nicholls was a good and attentive husband, but that she nevertheless felt a kind of holy terror at her new situation. In a letter to Ellen Nussey (Nell), in 1854 she wrote \"Indeed-indeed-Nell-it is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1977|page=400.}}</ref>\n\nThe following year she died aged 38. The cause of death given at the time was tuberculosis, but it may have been complicated with typhoid fever (the water at Haworth being likely contaminated due to poor sanitation and the vast cemetery that surrounded the church and the parsonage) and her pregnancy that was in its early stage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=769\u2013772}}</ref>\n\nThe first biography of Charlotte was written by [[Elizabeth Gaskell|Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell]] at the request of Patrick Bront\u00eb, and published in 1857, helping to create the myth of a family of condemned genius, living in a painful and romantic solitude. After having stayed at Haworth several times and having accommodated Charlotte in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, and become her friend and confidant, Mrs Gaskell had certainly had the advantage of knowing the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=651\u2013653, 681, 726\u2013728, 738\u2013741}}</ref>\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Jane Eyre (novel)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1847)\n* ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1849)\n* ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853)\n* ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' (1857)\n\n=== Unfinished fragments ===\nThese are outlines or unedited roughcasts which with the exception of ''Emma'' have been recently published.\n* ''Ashford'', written between 1840 and 1841, where certain characters from [[Glass Town|Angria]] are transported to Yorkshire and are included in a realistic plot.\n* ''Willie Ellin'', started after ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', and on which Charlotte worked relatively little in May and July 1853, is a story in three poorly linked parts in which the plot at this stage remains rather vague.\n* ''The Moores'' is an outline for two short chapters with two characters, the brothers Robert Moore, a dominator, and John Henry Moore, an intellectual fanatic.\n* ''Emma'', already published in 1860 with an introduction from [[Thackeray]].

The doctor confirmed that she was near to death and Anne thanked him for his candour. \"Take courage, take courage\" she murmured to Charlotte. She died at 2&nbsp;pm on Monday 18 May. She is buried in the cemetery of St Mary's of Scarborough.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=594\u2013595}}</ref> Her gravestone carried an error in her age in the inscription because she died at the age of 29 and not at 28. It was noticed by Charlotte during her only visit, and she had the intention of asking the mason to correct it. Ill health did not leave him time to effect the repair and the tombstone remained in the same state until replaced by the Bront\u00eb Society in April 2013.\n\n== Northern England at the time of the Bront\u00ebs ==\nIn her 1857 biography ''The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'', Mrs Gaskell begins with two explanatory and descriptive chapters. The first one covers the wild countryside of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the little village of Haworth, the parsonage and the church surrounded by its vast cemetery perched on the top of a hill. The second chapter presents an overview of the social, sanitary, and economic conditions of the region.\n\n=== Social, sanitary, and economic conditions in Haworth ===\nThe death toll within the Bront\u00eb family was not unusual and left little impression on the village population, who were confronted with death on a daily basis. When Patrick Bront\u00eb arrived, the parish was suffering from unemployment. The men sought work in the quarries and local handicrafts. The only businesses were the pharmacy which supplied Branwell, and John Greenwood's stationery store in which the Bront\u00ebs were the best customers.\n\nHaworth's population grew rapidly during the first half of the 18th&nbsp;century, from hardly 1,000 to 3,365 in 50 years.<ref>''The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth'', ''Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum'', Haworth 1820\u20131861, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The village did not have a sewage system and the well water was contaminated by faecal matter and the decomposition of bodies in the cemetery on the hilltop. Life expectancy was less than 25 years and infant mortality was around 41% of children under six months of age.<ref name=\"Haworth, 1861, p. 3\">''The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth'', ''Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum'', Haworth 1820\u20131861, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> Most of the population lived from working the poorly fertile land of the [[Moorland|moors]] and supplemented their incomes with work done at home, such as spinning and weaving wool from the sheep that were farmed on the moors.<ref name=\"Haworth, 1861, p. 3\"/> Conditions changed<ref>cf. the [[Luddites]] revolt and its consequences: {{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> and the textile industry, already present since the end of the 17th&nbsp;century, grew in the mills on the banks of the [[River Worth]], whose waters turned the wheels which consequently required fewer people to work them.\n\nFood was scarce, often little more than [[porridge]], resulting in vitamin deficiencies. Public hygiene was non-existent and lavatories were basic. The facilities at the parsonage were no more than a plank across a hole in a hut at the rear, with a lower plank for the children. In her thirties, Charlotte was described as having a toothless jaw, by such persons as Mrs Gaskell, who stated in a letter dated 25 August 1850 to Catherine Winkworth: \"large mouth and many teeth gone\".<ref>Margaret Smith, ''Letters'', volume II, letter 75, p.&nbsp;447.</ref> However, food was reasonable in the family. Well filled plates of porridge in the morning and piles of potatoes were peeled each day in the kitchen while Tabby told stories about her country or Emily revised her German grammar, and sometimes Mr Bront\u00eb would return home from his tours of the village with game donated by the parishioners.\n\n=== Role of the women ===\n[[File:P30b.jpg|thumb|right|Jane Eyre, pleading her case to her aunt, Mrs Reed, before she sends her to hard service at Lowood (second edition of ''Jane Eyre'', 1847)]]\n\nAccording to [[Robert Southey]], poet laureate, in his response to Charlotte, ladies from a good background should be content with an education and a marriage embellished with some decorative talents.<ref name=\"Gaskill 123\"/> Mr Bront\u00eb also said to one of the characters in his ''The Maid of Kilarney'', without one knowing whether it truly reflected a widespread opinion in order to support it or to condemn it: \"The education of female ought, most assuredly, to be competent, in order that she might enjoy herself, and be a fit companion for man. But, believe me, lovely, delicate and sprightly woman, is not formed by nature, to pore over the musty pages of Grecian and Roman literature, or to plod through the windings of Mathematical Problems, nor has Providence assigned for her sphere of action, either the cabinet or the field. Her ''forte'' is softness, tenderness and grace.\" In any case, it seemed to contradict his attitude towards his daughters whom he encouraged even if he was not completely aware of what they did with their time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|p=117}}</ref>\n\n== Sisters' place in literature ==\nDue to their forced or voluntary isolation, the Bront\u00eb sisters constituted a separate literary group which neither had predecessors nor successors. There is not a 'Bront\u00eb' line such as exists among authors of realist and naturalist novels, and in poetry, the romantic, and the symbolic.\n\nTheir influence certainly existed but it is difficult to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as [[Thomas Hardy]] in ''Jude the Obscure'' or ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'', or [[George Eliot]] with ''Adam Bede'' and ''The Mill on the Floss''. There were also more conventional authors such as [[Matthew Arnold]], who in a letter from 1853 says of Charlotte that she only pretends to heartless: \"nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=134}}</ref> In contrast, [[Mrs Humphry Ward]], author of ''Robert Elsmere'' and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily.<ref>{{harvnb|Drabble|1985|page=135}}</ref> There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.\n\n=== Pilgrimages to Haworth from 1860 ===\nBy 1860 Charlotte had been dead for five years, and the only people living at the parsonage were Mr. Bront\u00eb, his son-in-law, [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte was published, and though Mr. Bront\u00eb at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing and she had to struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters \u2013 although this never actually happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=766\u2013767,&nbsp;773,&nbsp;780,&nbsp;790\u2013791,&nbsp;806}}</ref>\n\nMrs. Gaskell's book caused a sensation and was distributed nationwide. The polemic launched by Charlotte's father resulted in a squabble that only served to increase the family's fame.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1995|pp=819\u2013820,&nbsp;822\u2013823}}</ref>\n\nDuring Charlotte's lifetime friends and sponsors visited the parsonage, including [[James J. Shuttleworth|Sir James]] and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, [[Ellen Nussey]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[John Store Smith]], a young writer from Manchester, [[Bessie Parkes]], who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and [[Abraham Holroyd]], poet, antiquarian, and historian.<ref name=\"Lemon\">{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Lemon|title=Early Visitors to Haworth, from Ellen Nussey to Virginia Woolf|year= 1996|page={{page needed|date=July 2014}}|publisher=Bront\u00eb Society|isbn=9780950582962}}</ref> However, following the publication of the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Bront\u00eb girls.<ref name=\"Lemon\"/> The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte's husband.<ref name=\"Lemon\"/>\n\n[[File:Anne Brontes Grave in Scarborough 01.JPG|thumb|left|Anne Bront\u00eb's grave in Scarborough]]\n\nThe flow of visitors has never abated.

She remarked on the symbiosis between the village and the Bront\u00eb sisters, the fact that utensils and clothes which would normally have disappeared before those who used them, have survived, enables one to better understand their singular presence.

For this, the locomotives ran with a new version of the large eight-wheel tender which held nine [[long ton]]s of coal. This and the usual facility for water replenishment from the [[Track pan|water trough]] system enabled them to travel the {{convert|392|mi|km}} from London to Edinburgh in eight hours non-stop.\n\n[[File:LNER pacific 4472 Flying Scotsman, with corridor tender (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|4472 ''Flying Scotsman'' in 1928, with [[corridor tender]]]]\nThe tender included a [[corridor connection]] and tunnel through the water tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed without stopping the train.

''Flying Scotsman'' emerged from [[Doncaster Works]] on 4 January 1947 as an A3, having received a boiler with the long \"banjo\" dome of the type it carries today. By this time it had been renumbered twice: under [[Edward Thompson (engineer)|Edward Thompson's]] comprehensive renumbering scheme for the LNER, it became No. 502 in January 1946; in May the same year, under an amendment to that plan, it became No. 103.<ref name=RCTS2A9ibc /> Following [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948\u20131994|nationalisation of the railways]] on 1 January 1948, almost all of the LNER locomotive numbers were increased by 60000; No. 103 became 60103 in December 1948.<ref name=RCTS2Aibc />\n\nBetween 5 June 1950 and 4 July 1954, and between 26 December 1954 and 1 September 1957, under [[British Rail]]ways ownership, it was allocated to Leicester Central shed on the [[Great Central Railway]], running [[Nottingham Victoria railway station|Nottingham Victoria]] to [[Marylebone station|London Marylebone]] services via [[Leicester Central railway station|Leicester Central]].\n\nAll A3 Pacifics were subsequently fitted with a double [[Kylchap]] chimney to improve performance and economy. This caused soft exhaust and smoke drift that tended to obscure the driver's forward vision; the remedy was found in the German-type [[smoke deflector]]s fitted from 1960, which somewhat changed the locomotives' appearance.<ref>Reed Brian \"LNER non-streamlined Pacifics\" Profile Publications, Windsor, UK.

In the meantime, watering facilities for steam locomotives were disappearing, so in September 1966, Pegler purchased a second corridor tender which was adapted as an auxiliary water tank; retaining its through gangway, this was coupled behind the normal tender.<ref>{{harvnb|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1986|pp=68\u201369, 70, 88}}</ref>\n\nPegler had a contract permitting him to run his locomotive on BR until 1972. Following overhaul in the winter of 1968\u201369 Harold Wilson's government agreed to support Pegler running the locomotive in the United States and Canada to support British exports. To comply with local railway regulations it was fitted with: a [[cowcatcher]], bell, [[buckeye coupling]]s, American-style whistle,<ref>{{harvnb|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1986|p=88}}</ref> air brakes, and high-intensity headlamp. Starting in [[Boston, Massachusetts]],<ref name=GuardObit/> the tour ran into immediate problems, with some states increasing costs by requiring diesel-headed-haulage through them, seeing the locomotive as a fire hazard. However, the train ran from Boston to New York City, Washington, D.C. and Dallas in 1969; from [[Texas]] to [[Wisconsin]] and finishing in [[Montreal]] in 1970; and from Toronto to San Francisco in 1971 \u2013 a total of {{convert|15400|mi}}.<ref name=TimesObit/>\n\nGovernment financial support for the tour was withdrawn by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservative government in 1970, but Pegler decided to return for the 1970 season.

It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive and use it as a marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.<ref name=\"NRM2012-10-26\">{{cite web |last=Meanley |first=Robert |title=A report for the Trustees of the Science Museum Group into the restoration of A3 Class Pacific Flying Scotsman and associated engineering project management |publisher=[[National Railway Museum]] |date=26 November 2012 |url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/~/media/Files/NRM/PDF/Scotsman.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115053436/http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/~/media/Files/NRM/PDF/Scotsman.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the report, the NRM commissioned First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently review the remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations on how to proceed.

For this, the locomotives ran with a new version of the large eight-wheel tender which held nine [[long ton]]s of coal.

''Flying Scotsman'' emerged from [[Doncaster Works]] on 4 January 1947 as an A3, having received a boiler with the long \"banjo\" dome of the type it carries today.

It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, and because it was deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul.<ref name=\"NRM2012-10-26\" /> Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to [[Jeremy Hosking]] for potential use on his locomotive, [[LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern|LNER Class A4 4464 ''Bittern'']].<ref>{{cite journal|date=February\u2013March 2009|title=NRM sells Scotsman boiler in hush-hush deal|journal=Heritage Railway|volume=121|page=6|author=Courtney, Geoff}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, the museum pushed back the expected completion date by 18 months, due in part to issues with the boiler restoration.<ref name=\"NRM2012-10-26\" /> By January 2009, with further problems encountered including misaligned frames and a cracked right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further \u00a3250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/england/north_yorkshire/7842048.stm|title=BBC News Online {{!}} Cash plea for iconic steam engine|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=6 October 2016}}</ref> In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following final testing it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-13573408|title=BBC News \u2013 Flying Scotsman on show at National Railway Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=6 October 2016}}</ref> In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the frame assembly, leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.<ref name=\"NRM2012-10-26\" />[[File:Flying Scotsman under repair.JPG|thumb|In the [[National Railway Museum]]'s workshops in 2012 for restoration]]\nIn October 2012, with the project still unfinished, the museum published a report examining the reasons for the delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive and use it as a marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.<ref name=\"NRM2012-10-26\">{{cite web |last=Meanley |first=Robert |title=A report for the Trustees of the Science Museum Group into the restoration of A3 Class Pacific Flying Scotsman and associated engineering project management |publisher=[[National Railway Museum]] |date=26 November 2012 |url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/~/media/Files/NRM/PDF/Scotsman.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115053436/http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/~/media/Files/NRM/PDF/Scotsman.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the report, the NRM commissioned First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently review the remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations on how to proceed.
