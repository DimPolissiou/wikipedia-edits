Jake confesses to the Na'vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces.

Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace.

Jake confesses to the Na'vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape.\n\nTo regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives.

Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an [[mecha|AMP suit]], escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time.\n\nWith the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth.

The Tasmanian Devils Football Club formed in 2001 and was admitted into the VFL in its inaugural season the same year. The AFL continues to own the club.\n\nThe nickname \"Devils\" was chosen as the moniker for the club after the tenacious marsupial predator the [[Tasmanian devil]] which is indigenous to the island of Tasmania. The club colours green, red, gold (and black) were inspired by the original [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] \"map\" guernsey and are also Tasmania's sporting colours.\n\nThe Devils established home grounds in both [[Hobart]] and [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] to deal with the long-standing north-south rivalry. Originally northern home games were played at Ulverstone, Devonport, Burnie and at Launceston's [[Aurora Stadium]] while [[North Hobart Oval]] hosted games in the south. At the end of the 2005 season the team moved from North Hobart Oval to [[Bellerive Oval]] for home games in the south and began playing all northern home games at Aurora Stadium.\n\n2001 and 2002 brought mediocre results but, under the direction of coach [[Matthew Armstrong (Australian footballer)|Matthew Armstrong]], the Devils made the finals for the first time in 2003, finishing a respectable third.

The Tasmanian Devils Football Club formed in 2001 and was admitted into the VFL in its inaugural season the same year. The AFL continues to own the club.\n\nThe nickname \"Devils\" was chosen as the moniker for the club after the tenacious marsupial predator the [[Tasmanian devil]] which is indigenous to the island of Tasmania. The club colours green, red, gold (and black) were inspired by the original [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] \"map\" guernsey and are also Tasmania's sporting colours.\n\nThe Devils established home grounds in both [[Hobart]] and [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] to deal with the long-standing north-south rivalry. Originally northern home games were played at Ulverstone, Devonport, Burnie and at Launceston's [[Aurora Stadium]] while [[North Hobart Oval]] hosted games in the south. At the end of the 2005 season the team moved from North Hobart Oval to [[Bellerive Oval]] for home games in the south and began playing all northern home games at Aurora Stadium.\n\n2001 and 2002 brought mediocre results but, under the direction of coach [[Matthew Armstrong (Australian footballer)|Matthew Armstrong]], the Devils made the finals for the first time in 2003, finishing a respectable third. The 2004 and 2005 seasons saw the Devils again making the finals.\n\nAt the start of the 2006 season the Devils and the [[Australian Football League]]'s [[North Melbourne Football Club]] began a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|partial alignment]], allowing North Melbourne listed players to play for Tasmania when not selected in the seniors, and arrangement which lasted from 2006 until 2007.
