The 80-year-old BENCO chimney was also re-erected to commemorate the institute's completion of a century. \n\n==History==\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi has formerly been known as the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO), the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET), the College of Technology (TECHNO) and the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IT-BHU). Its establishment is intimately linked with that of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The first convocation ceremony at BHU was held on 19 January 1919. The Chancellor of the University, [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV|Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar]] of [[Mysore]] who had come to preside over and address the convocation, performed the opening ceremony of the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO) Workshop buildings.<ref name=\"History of BHU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/Centre/history.html|title=History of the University|publisher=Banaras Hindu University|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> An Artisan Course was started on 11 February 1919. BHU has the credit of first starting degree classes in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy and Pharmaceutics, thanks to the foresight of its founder, Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]].\n[[File:Dept of Electrical Engineering IIT-BHU.jpg|thumb|left|Dept of Electrical Engineering IIT(BHU), Varanasi]]\n\nThe Department of Geology was started under BENCO in 1920. Courses in Mining and Metallurgy were introduced by the Geology Department. The Department of Industrial Chemistry was started in July, 1921. In 1923, Mining and Metallurgy were established as separate departments and in 1944, they were raised to the status of a college forming the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET).<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/>\n\nBHU was the first Indian university to introduce the study of Pharmaceutical Chemistry.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/> This initiative was taken in 1932 when a new group of subjects for the B.Sc. Examination consisting of (a) Chemistry, (b) Botany with Pharmacognosy and (c) Pharmaceutical Studies was started in 1934 and in 1935 a new three-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy was introduced. The science departments of the University were under the Central Hindu College. In September 1935, a new College of Science was constituted comprising the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry and Ceramics. In 1937, the Department of Glass Technology also came into existence under this college. The year 1939 witnessed the establishment of a separate College of Technology (TECHNO) comprising the departments of Industrial Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Ceramics and Glass Technology.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/>\n[[File:IIT_(BHU)_2019_stamps_of_India.png|thumb|IIT (BHU) commemorated on a 2019 stamp of India.]]\nIn 1968, BENCO, TECHNO and MINMET were merged into one and the Institute of Technology (IT-BHU) was established integrating the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil and Municipal Engineering, Mining Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Technology, Silicate Technology and Pharmaceutics. The Department of Silicate Technology subsequently became the Department of Ceramic Engineering. A separate Department of Electronics Engineering was also established.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/> The departments of Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics and Applied Chemistry were established in 1985.\n\nThe earlier system of regional admission based on merit lists was replaced in 1972 by admission through [[Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination]] (IIT-JEE) for undergraduate courses and [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] (GATE) for postgraduate courses. In the tenth meeting of IIT Council in 1972, it was also proposed to convert the then IT-BHU into an IIT and a committee was appointed by IIT Council for the same but because of political reasons, the desired conversion could not be achieved then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iitsystem.ac.in/IITcouncil/minutes/Minutes-10-Meeting-of-IIT-Council.pdf|title=Minutes of 10th Meeting of IIT Council|work=iitsystem.ac.in|accessdate=8 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117234832/https://www.iitsystem.ac.in/IITcouncil/minutes/Minutes-10-Meeting-of-IIT-Council.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Committees constituted by MHRD (Professors Joshi and Anand Krishnan Committees)<ref>{{cite web|author=Urmi A Goswami 8 May 2007, 03.00am IST |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Wait_longer_for_IIT-level_engg_colleges/articleshow/2015905.cms |title=The Economic Times: Wait Longer for IIT-level engg colleges |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> had recommended for the conversion of the Institute into an [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2005/nov/18iit.htm |title=Rediff: Turn BHU-IT into full fledged IIT |publisher=Inhome.rediff.com |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> On 17 July 2008, the government of India issued a press release granting \"In principle approval for taking over the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University \u2013 a constituent unit of the Banaras Hindu University, a Central University, its conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology and integrating it with the IIT system in the country.\"<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=40461 |title=Setting up of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and conversion of IT-BHU into an IIT |work=pib.nic.in |accessdate=3 May 2012|publisher=[[Government of India]]}}</ref> The BHU Executive Council approved the proposal of the HRD ministry to convert IT-BHU to IIT (BHU) Varanasi, retaining academic and administrative ties to BHU.\n\nOn 4 August 2010 a bill seeking to amend the Institutes of Technology Act 1961 to declare IT-BHU an IIT was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Minister of State for HRD, D.

Its establishment is intimately linked with that of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The first convocation ceremony at BHU was held on 19 January 1919. The Chancellor of the University, [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV|Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar]] of [[Mysore]] who had come to preside over and address the convocation, performed the opening ceremony of the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO) Workshop buildings.<ref name=\"History of BHU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/Centre/history.html|title=History of the University|publisher=Banaras Hindu University|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> An Artisan Course was started on 11 February 1919. BHU has the credit of first starting degree classes in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy and Pharmaceutics, thanks to the foresight of its founder, Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]].\n[[File:Dept of Electrical Engineering IIT-BHU.jpg|thumb|left|Dept of Electrical Engineering IIT(BHU), Varanasi]]\n\nThe Department of Geology was started under BENCO in 1920. Courses in Mining and Metallurgy were introduced by the Geology Department. The Department of Industrial Chemistry was started in July, 1921. In 1923, Mining and Metallurgy were established as separate departments and in 1944, they were raised to the status of a college forming the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET).<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/>\n\nBHU was the first Indian university to introduce the study of Pharmaceutical Chemistry.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/> This initiative was taken in 1932 when a new group of subjects for the B.Sc. Examination consisting of (a) Chemistry, (b) Botany with Pharmacognosy and (c) Pharmaceutical Studies was started in 1934 and in 1935 a new three-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy was introduced. The science departments of the University were under the Central Hindu College. In September 1935, a new College of Science was constituted comprising the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry and Ceramics. In 1937, the Department of Glass Technology also came into existence under this college. The year 1939 witnessed the establishment of a separate College of Technology (TECHNO) comprising the departments of Industrial Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Ceramics and Glass Technology.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/>\n[[File:IIT_(BHU)_2019_stamps_of_India.png|thumb|IIT (BHU) commemorated on a 2019 stamp of India.]]\nIn 1968, BENCO, TECHNO and MINMET were merged into one and the Institute of Technology (IT-BHU) was established integrating the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil and Municipal Engineering, Mining Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Technology, Silicate Technology and Pharmaceutics. The Department of Silicate Technology subsequently became the Department of Ceramic Engineering. A separate Department of Electronics Engineering was also established.<ref name=\"History of BHU\"/> The departments of Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics and Applied Chemistry were established in 1985.\n\nThe earlier system of regional admission based on merit lists was replaced in 1972 by admission through [[Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination]] (IIT-JEE) for undergraduate courses and [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] (GATE) for postgraduate courses. In the tenth meeting of IIT Council in 1972, it was also proposed to convert the then IT-BHU into an IIT and a committee was appointed by IIT Council for the same but because of political reasons, the desired conversion could not be achieved then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iitsystem.ac.in/IITcouncil/minutes/Minutes-10-Meeting-of-IIT-Council.pdf|title=Minutes of 10th Meeting of IIT Council|work=iitsystem.ac.in|accessdate=8 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117234832/https://www.iitsystem.ac.in/IITcouncil/minutes/Minutes-10-Meeting-of-IIT-Council.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Committees constituted by MHRD (Professors Joshi and Anand Krishnan Committees)<ref>{{cite web|author=Urmi A Goswami 8 May 2007, 03.00am IST |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Wait_longer_for_IIT-level_engg_colleges/articleshow/2015905.cms |title=The Economic Times: Wait Longer for IIT-level engg colleges |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> had recommended for the conversion of the Institute into an [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2005/nov/18iit.htm |title=Rediff: Turn BHU-IT into full fledged IIT |publisher=Inhome.rediff.com |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> On 17 July 2008, the government of India issued a press release granting \"In principle approval for taking over the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University \u2013 a constituent unit of the Banaras Hindu University, a Central University, its conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology and integrating it with the IIT system in the country.\"<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=40461 |title=Setting up of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and conversion of IT-BHU into an IIT |work=pib.nic.in |accessdate=3 May 2012|publisher=[[Government of India]]}}</ref> The BHU Executive Council approved the proposal of the HRD ministry to convert IT-BHU to IIT (BHU) Varanasi, retaining academic and administrative ties to BHU.\n\nOn 4 August 2010 a bill seeking to amend the Institutes of Technology Act 1961 to declare IT-BHU an IIT was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Minister of State for HRD, D.

({{trans|Sometimes Joy, Sometimes Sorrow...}}), also known as simply '''''K3G''''', is an Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Karan Johar]] and produced by [[Yash Johar]]. The film stars [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Kajol]], [[Hrithik Roshan]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]], with [[Rani Mukerji]] appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]], [[Sandesh Shandilya]] and [[Aadesh Shrivastava]], with lyrics penned by [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]] and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty. The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower [[Social class|socio-economic group]] than them.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 1998, soon after the release of Johar's debut film ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). [[Principal photography]] began on 16 October 2000 in [[Mumbai]] and continued in [[London]] and [[Egypt]]. ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' was promoted with the tag-line \"It's All About Loving Your Parents\". Initially scheduled to release during the [[Diwali]] festivities of 2001, the film eventually released in India, [[United Kingdom]] and [[North America]] on 14 December 2001.\n\nMade on a budget of {{INRConvert|400|m}}, ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' emerged as a major commercial success, both domestically and internationally, with a lifetime gross of {{INR|1.36 billion}} ({{US$|{{#expr:1360/47.186 round 0}} million|long=no}}) at the worldwide box office becoming the highest grossing Indian film ever worldwide at the time of its release . Outside India, the film was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|highest-grossing Indian film]] ever, until its record was broken by Johar's next directorial, ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006). ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' won several awards at popular award ceremonies the following year, including five [[Filmfare Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nYashvardhan \"Yash\" Raichand is a billionaire business tycoon living in [[Delhi]] with his wife Nandini and sons Rahul and Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and strictly follows traditions. Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known to everyone in the household except Rohan.\n\nAdult Rahul returns home after completing his education abroad and falls in love with the vivacious Anjali Sharma. However, their love is forbidden because Anjali is from a low-income background. During this time, Rohan, still a child, is sent to [[boarding school]]. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina, a high-society woman and Rahul's childhood friend, as Yash believes that parents have the right to choose their child's spouse. However, when he comes to know of Anjali, he is enraged due to her status, and Rahul promises not to marry her, as he does not want to hurt his father. However, Rahul discovers that Anjali's father has died, leaving behind Anjali and her kid sister Pooja. He spontaneously decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. When he brings Anjali home, Yash disowns Rahul, reminding him of his adopted status. Hurt by this, Rahul shares a tearful goodbye with Nandini and leaves home. Rohan never finds out the truth of why Rahul left home.\n\nTen years later, an adult Rohan returns home from boarding school and finally learns from his grandmothers why Rahul left as well as the fact that he is actually adopted. Seeing the pain that this separation has brought upon his parents, Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and Pooja have moved to [[London]], and travels there, lying to his parents that it is to pursue further studies. In London, Rahul and Anjali live happily with a young son, Krish, and Pooja, now an ultra-modern diva studying at [[King's College London]]. Rohan and Pooja, who were childhood friends in the past after their elder siblings fell in love, reunite and she supports him in his quest to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Rohan poses as Pooja's friend who has come from India and Rahul agrees to let him live with them after Rohan introduces himself as \"Yash\" to hide his real identity: Rahul does not recognise his immensely-changed now-adult brother after so many years. Meanwhile, Rohan and Pooja grow closer and develop feelings for one another. At Krish's school function, when Pooja asks Krish how he got over his stage nerves, he recites some advice that Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this exact advice ten years ago, hears Krish and finally realizes that \"Yash\" is actually his brother.\n\nRohan begs Rahul to come home but he refuses, reminding him of what their father had said. Rohan invites his parents to London and arranges a covert reunion where he brings them all to the same mall. Nandini and Rahul share an emotional reunion. However, when Yash sees Rahul, Anjali and Pooja with Rohan, he is enraged at Rohan and their confrontation does not go well. Nandini stands up to Yash for the first time, telling him that he was wrong for disowning Rahul and did not do right by breaking the family. After their grandmother's death, Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul and Anjali to come home. Nandini gives the couple a proper welcome and Yash tearfully asks for forgiveness, telling Rahul that he had always loved him. Rohan and Pooja, who have fallen in love, are married, and the family holds a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Yashvardhan \"Yash\" Raichand, a [[Delhi]] based business tycoon. Fiercely dominating, he insists on controlling the life of his wife and sons. Amitabh Bachchan was Karan's first choice for the portrayal of Yash Raichand. Karan added, \"As I wrote the film, I realised that Yashvardhan Raichand is the backbone of the film and I could only see one actor playing the role \u2014 [[Amitabh Bachchan]].\" Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration.<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite web|title=Excerpts from the making of K3g |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/08k3g.htm |publisher=Rediff |accessdate=2 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124717/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/08k3g.htm |archivedate= 4 March 2016 |df= }}</ref> Karan mentioned that he was initially scared to direct a star of the stature of Bachchan, but the latter \"soon became an actor instead of a superstar\".<ref name=\"Mukerji\"/>\n* [[Jaya Bachchan]] as Nandini Raichand, Yash's wife.

Kajol, however, was moved to tears during the script narration and agreed to do the film.<ref name=\"casting\"/> In an interview to ''[[Filmfare]]'', Kajol said, \"One tiny fact that Karan forgot to mention during his narration was just how much Punjabi my character spoke in the film.

In the book, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Film'', Eric Mazur described several \"mythological subtexts\" in the film. While mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshiping \"[[Hindu deities]] during the annual [[Diwali]] holiday\", he explained that the scene allowed the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] audiences to participate in the ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' along with the characters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazur|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Rajani Mazumdar compared ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' to ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a \"spectacular stage that moves across global locations\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazumdar|2007|pp=136}}</ref> She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places&nbsp;\u2013 the Raichand home and the interiors of [[Chandni Chowk]]. While the Raichand house is described as \"expensive, almost like a museum\", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the \"spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazumdar|2007|pp=138\u2013140}}</ref>\n\nWriter Sangita Gopal analysed the \"intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema\" in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a \"thundering background score\" coupled with \"360\u00b0 panning shots\" were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' of 2000), they gradually shifted \"to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bhattacharya Mehta|Pandharipande|2010|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> Mazur mentioned the use of \"[[dream sequence]]s\" in the film as a means of escapism. He referred to the song \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" as an [[Diegesis|extradiegetic]] sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate \"in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.\" He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme [[close-up]]s on their eyes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazur|2011|pp=79\u201381}}</ref>\n\nWriting for the book ''Movie Blockbusters'', Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]]'s in [[Canada]], United Kingdom and North America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stringer|2003|pp=255\u2013257}}</ref> In the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hirji|2010|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional [[sari]] and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker. She also frets about her son and younger sister being \"too influenced\" by Western culture. The film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences.<ref>{{harv|Punathambekar|2005|pp=159}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Oonk|2007|pp=214}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Eckstein, several sequences convey a \"culturally conservative\" and \"idealistic image\" of India, while maintaining that the diaspora living in Britain lead a life of \"involuntary exile\". Western ideology is equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Burger King]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2008|pp=68\u201370}}</ref> Creekmur believes that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease.

Gham...''''' ({{trans|Sometimes Joy, Sometimes Sorrow...}}), also known as simply '''''K3G''''', is an Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Karan Johar]] and produced by [[Yash Johar]]. The film stars [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Kajol]], [[Hrithik Roshan]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]], with [[Rani Mukerji]] appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]], [[Sandesh Shandilya]] and [[Aadesh Shrivastava]], with lyrics penned by [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]] and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty. The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower [[Social class|socio-economic group]] than them.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 1998, soon after the release of Johar's debut film ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). [[Principal photography]] began on 16 October 2000 in [[Mumbai]] and continued in [[London]] and [[Egypt]]. ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' was promoted with the tag-line \"It's All About Loving Your Parents\". Initially scheduled to release during the [[Diwali]] festivities of 2001, the film eventually released in India, [[United Kingdom]] and [[North America]] on 14 December 2001.\n\nMade on a budget of {{INRConvert|400|m}}, ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' emerged as a major commercial success, both domestically and internationally, with a lifetime gross of {{INR|1.36 billion}} ({{US$|{{#expr:1360/47.186 round 0}} million|long=no}}) at the worldwide box office becoming the highest grossing Indian film ever worldwide at the time of its release . Outside India, the film was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|highest-grossing Indian film]] ever, until its record was broken by Johar's next directorial, ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006). ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' won several awards at popular award ceremonies the following year, including five [[Filmfare Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nYashvardhan \"Yash\" Raichand is a billionaire business tycoon living in [[Delhi]] with his wife Nandini and sons Rahul and Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and strictly follows traditions. Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known to everyone in the household except Rohan.\n\nAdult Rahul returns home after completing his education abroad and falls in love with the vivacious Anjali Sharma. However, their love is forbidden because Anjali is from a low-income background. During this time, Rohan, still a child, is sent to [[boarding school]]. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina, a high-society woman and Rahul's childhood friend, as Yash believes that parents have the right to choose their child's spouse. However, when he comes to know of Anjali, he is enraged due to her status, and Rahul promises not to marry her, as he does not want to hurt his father. However, Rahul discovers that Anjali's father has died, leaving behind Anjali and her kid sister Pooja. He spontaneously decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. When he brings Anjali home, Yash disowns Rahul, reminding him of his adopted status. Hurt by this, Rahul shares a tearful goodbye with Nandini and leaves home. Rohan never finds out the truth of why Rahul left home.\n\nTen years later, an adult Rohan returns home from boarding school and finally learns from his grandmothers why Rahul left as well as the fact that he is actually adopted. Seeing the pain that this separation has brought upon his parents, Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and Pooja have moved to [[London]], and travels there, lying to his parents that it is to pursue further studies. In London, Rahul and Anjali live happily with a young son, Krish, and Pooja, now an ultra-modern diva studying at [[King's College London]]. Rohan and Pooja, who were childhood friends in the past after their elder siblings fell in love, reunite and she supports him in his quest to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Rohan poses as Pooja's friend who has come from India and Rahul agrees to let him live with them after Rohan introduces himself as \"Yash\" to hide his real identity: Rahul does not recognise his immensely-changed now-adult brother after so many years. Meanwhile, Rohan and Pooja grow closer and develop feelings for one another. At Krish's school function, when Pooja asks Krish how he got over his stage nerves, he recites some advice that Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this exact advice ten years ago, hears Krish and finally realizes that \"Yash\" is actually his brother.\n\nRohan begs Rahul to come home but he refuses, reminding him of what their father had said. Rohan invites his parents to London and arranges a covert reunion where he brings them all to the same mall. Nandini and Rahul share an emotional reunion. However, when Yash sees Rahul, Anjali and Pooja with Rohan, he is enraged at Rohan and their confrontation does not go well. Nandini stands up to Yash for the first time, telling him that he was wrong for disowning Rahul and did not do right by breaking the family. After their grandmother's death, Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul and Anjali to come home. Nandini gives the couple a proper welcome and Yash tearfully asks for forgiveness, telling Rahul that he had always loved him. Rohan and Pooja, who have fallen in love, are married, and the family holds a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Yashvardhan \"Yash\" Raichand, a [[Delhi]] based business tycoon. Fiercely dominating, he insists on controlling the life of his wife and sons. Amitabh Bachchan was Karan's first choice for the portrayal of Yash Raichand.

Karan was initially hesitant to cast Kajol in the film, as he felt that she would refuse the offer due to her recent marriage. Kajol, however, was moved to tears during the script narration and agreed to do the film.<ref name=\"casting\"/> In an interview to ''[[Filmfare]]'', Kajol said, \"One tiny fact that Karan forgot to mention during his narration was just how much Punjabi my character spoke in the film.

In the book, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Film'', Eric Mazur described several \"mythological subtexts\" in the film. While mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshiping \"[[Hindu deities]] during the annual [[Diwali]] holiday\", he explained that the scene allowed the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] audiences to participate in the ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' along with the characters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazur|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Rajani Mazumdar compared ''Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...'' to ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a \"spectacular stage that moves across global locations\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazumdar|2007|pp=136}}</ref> She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places&nbsp;\u2013 the Raichand home and the interiors of [[Chandni Chowk]]. While the Raichand house is described as \"expensive, almost like a museum\", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the \"spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazumdar|2007|pp=138\u2013140}}</ref>\n\nWriter Sangita Gopal analysed the \"intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema\" in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a \"thundering background score\" coupled with \"360\u00b0 panning shots\" were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' of 2000), they gradually shifted \"to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bhattacharya Mehta|Pandharipande|2010|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> Mazur mentioned the use of \"[[dream sequence]]s\" in the film as a means of escapism. He referred to the song \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" as an [[Diegesis|extradiegetic]] sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate \"in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.\" He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme [[close-up]]s on their eyes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mazur|2011|pp=79\u201381}}</ref>\n\nWriting for the book ''Movie Blockbusters'', Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]]'s in [[Canada]], United Kingdom and North America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stringer|2003|pp=255\u2013257}}</ref> In the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hirji|2010|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional [[sari]] and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker.

Western ideology is equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Burger King]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2008|pp=68\u201370}}</ref> Creekmur believes that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease.

He is the original Black Ranger of the first generation of Power Rangers. He was played by actor [[Walter Emanuel Jones]]. In Philippine remake he was portrayed by ''[[StarStruck (season 7)|StarStruck VII]]'' Avenger Radson Flores.\n\n==Character history==\n===''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''===\nZack and his close friends [[Kimberly Hart]], [[Jason Lee Scott]], [[Billy Cranston]] and [[Trini Kwan]] were picked as the five original Power Rangers by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to defend Earth from the evil sorceress [[Rita Repulsa]]. Zack was chosen as the '''Black Power Ranger''', gaining the [[Mastodon]] Power Coin and the Mastodon Dinozord.<ref>{{cite news|title= From Power Bow to Hip-Hop-Kido |publisher= The Baltimore Sun|date=|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-29/features/1993363109_1_zord-power-rangers-popular-power|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\nQuick-witted and clever, Zack relies on a combination of skill, strength, and agility to win his battles. The original Black Ranger is an energetic, charismatic, and fun-loving young man. He enjoys athletics (such as basketball, American football, and scuba diving), dancing (especially to a fresh beat bumping out of his friend's boombox), parties, and girls. Whenever he didn't have an arm around Trini or Kimberly, Zack could be found pursuing his attractive, but hard-to-get classmate, Angela. Zack always loved a good joke. Though he loved all the people close to him, Zack's best friend was clearly Jason. Zack is extremely confident and positive. Only four occasions saw Zack ready to give it up: when the Green Ranger took out Zordon, [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] and the Command Center while removing the Rangers from the Megazord; when his team was placed under a spell to take away their confidence; and when their Dinozords were commandeered by [[Lord Zedd]]'s first monster, Pirantishead. But the first occasion happened very early in the series when his friends pretended to have forgotten his birthday. Zack went off into a secluded area, and into a trap by [[Rita Repulsa]]. For some time, he had to fight the powerful Knasty Knight alone. Oddly enough, despite his plentiful confidence, Zack is an extreme ophidiophobe, arachnophobe, and entomophobe meaning he is terrified of snakes, spiders, and insects although, on one occasion when performing magic for a group of children seeking shelter from a monster attack, he handled two fake snakes and used them to scare off [[Bulk and Skull]]. Because of this, it can be assumed that Zack's fear of snakes deteriorated over time, especially after an encounter on Rita's Island of Illusion where his strength of will was tested against his fear of snakes.\n\nZack enjoyed [[martial arts]] just as much as he did dancing and, as a result, created his own fighting style, called [[Hip hop culture|Hip Hop]] kido. The customized art consisted of dance-like maneuvers flourished with fast and powerful strikes, much like [[Capoeira]] or as seen by actor Daniel O' Neill in Bangkok Adrenaline. This effective combination of power and prowess made Zack an incredibly formidable combatant.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tfHsRohsTXwC&pg=PA85&dq=rita+repulsa&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCmoVChMIx7me55uIyQIVQ-kUCh3vKg0U#v=onepage&q=white%20ranger&f=false|title=Contemporary Media Culture and the Remnants of a Colonial Past |author=Kent A.

He is the original Black Ranger of the first generation of Power Rangers. He was played by actor [[Walter Emanuel Jones]]. In Philippine remake he was portrayed by ''[[StarStruck (season 7)|StarStruck VII]]'' Avenger Radson Flores.\n\n==Character history==\n===''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''===\nZack and his close friends [[Kimberly Hart]], [[Jason Lee Scott]], [[Billy Cranston]] and [[Trini Kwan]] were picked as the five original Power Rangers by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to defend Earth from the evil sorceress [[Rita Repulsa]]. Zack was chosen as the '''Black Power Ranger''', gaining the [[Mastodon]] Power Coin and the Mastodon Dinozord.<ref>{{cite news|title= From Power Bow to Hip-Hop-Kido |publisher= The Baltimore Sun|date=|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-29/features/1993363109_1_zord-power-rangers-popular-power|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\nQuick-witted and clever, Zack relies on a combination of skill, strength, and agility to win his battles. The original Black Ranger is an energetic, charismatic, and fun-loving young man. He enjoys athletics (such as basketball, American football, and scuba diving), dancing (especially to a fresh beat bumping out of his friend's boombox), parties, and girls. Whenever he didn't have an arm around Trini or Kimberly, Zack could be found pursuing his attractive, but hard-to-get classmate, Angela. Zack always loved a good joke. Though he loved all the people close to him, Zack's best friend was clearly Jason. Zack is extremely confident and positive. Only four occasions saw Zack ready to give it up: when the Green Ranger took out Zordon, [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] and the Command Center while removing the Rangers from the Megazord; when his team was placed under a spell to take away their confidence; and when their Dinozords were commandeered by [[Lord Zedd]]'s first monster, Pirantishead. But the first occasion happened very early in the series when his friends pretended to have forgotten his birthday. Zack went off into a secluded area, and into a trap by [[Rita Repulsa]]. For some time, he had to fight the powerful Knasty Knight alone. Oddly enough, despite his plentiful confidence, Zack is an extreme ophidiophobe, arachnophobe, and entomophobe meaning he is terrified of snakes, spiders, and insects although, on one occasion when performing magic for a group of children seeking shelter from a monster attack, he handled two fake snakes and used them to scare off [[Bulk and Skull]].

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population.

Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[East Samoa]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th-15th-century [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in The [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263}}</ref> For more, see the [[Quarantine#Middle Ages to early modern period|medieval history paragraph]].\n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

Ships arriving in Venice from infected ports were required to sit at anchor for 40 days before landing. This practice, called quarantine, was derived from the Italian words quaranta giorni which mean 40 days.\n\n===Ancient===\nAn early mention of isolation occurs in the Biblical [[book of Leviticus]], written in the seventh century BC or perhaps earlier, which describes the procedure for separating out infected people to prevent the spread of disease under the [[Mosaic Law]]:\n\n<blockquote>\"If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days.

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion, ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from a plague.\n\n== Signals and flags ==\n[[Image:ICS Quebec.svg|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] \"Quebec, \" also called the \"Yellow Jack\" is a simple yellow flag that was historically used to signal quarantine (it stands for '''Q'''), but in modern use indicates the opposite, as a signal of a ship free of disease that requests boarding and inspection.]]\nPlain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolize disease in both ships and ports, with the color yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a color of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking color for disease.

It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\n[[Biosecurity in Australia]] is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]'', which replaced the ''[[Quarantine Act 1908]]''.\n\nAustralia has perhaps the world's strictest quarantine standards.

The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travelers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveler has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveler, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveler who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognized yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harboring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each installment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[East Samoa]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country.

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n== Signals and flags ==\n[[Image:ICS Quebec.svg|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] \"Quebec, \" also called the \"Yellow Jack\" is a simple yellow flag that was historically used to signal quarantine (it stands for '''Q'''), but in modern use indicates the opposite, as a signal of a ship free of disease that requests boarding and inspection.]]\nPlain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolize disease in both ships and ports, with the color yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a color of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking color for disease.

The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travelers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveler has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveler, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveler who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognized yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harboring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each installment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord.

It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district.

Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia. The twin kingdoms' attempt to retain their hegemony brought them to a conflict with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which wanted to monopolize the [[spice trade]] in the [[Moluccas]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=45\u201347}} In 1660, the Dutch attacked Gowa and managed to seize the fort of Paqnakkukang.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=49}} Gowa then forced its vassals to provide labor to build military constructions in anticipation of further conflict, which ultimately resulted in a rebellion led by the Bon\u00e9 noble [[Arung Palakka]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=50\u201352}} However, his attempt to revive the ''Tellumpocco'' alliance failed, as Wajoq refused to break its treaty with Gowa to join forces with the rebels.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=54}}<!-- According to the historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Wajoq's decision can be explained by the fact that its recent experiences with Gowa were much more positive than those with Bon\u00e9.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}} In the most recent memory of the Wajorese, it was Bon\u00e9, not Gowa, which invaded their country. Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 also had frequent disputes over territorial boundaries and the allegiance of their vassals.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}}{{efn|system of vassals...}} On the other hand, Wajoq's relationship with Gowa had been more friendly in the preceding years; Wajoq was one of Gowa's most trusted vassals, with the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Senngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) had even been married to a daughter of Gowa ruler [[Hasanuddin of Gowa|Hasanuddin]] (r. 1653\u20131669).{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 54\u201355}}--> Lacking enough support, the rebellion was successfully quelled by Gowa and Wajoq forces, driving Arung Palakka to escape to [[Buton]], and later, to [[Batavia]], seeking aid from the VOC.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=56\u201359, 66}}\n\nDuring the [[Makassar War]] (1666\u20131669), Wajoq fiercely supported Gowa against the alliance of the VOC and local forces from Bon\u00e9 and elsewhere led by Arung Palakka. Even after the fall of Gowa's court Sombaopu and the formal surrender of Gowa and Talloq, the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Sengngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) still refused to abide by the [[Treaty of Bungaya]] and continued to resist the Dutch and Bon\u00e9 forces.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 124\u2013126, 138}} By mid-1670, Arung Palakka had launched a large-scale invasion of Wajoq.<!-- Along the way, several Wajoq's vassals deserted and joined Bon\u00e9 forces, bringing the total number of invading forces to around 40,000 people when it arrived to besiege Tosora, the walled capital city of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=138\u2013139}}--> Despite hard resistance from Wajorese defenders, the walled capital city of Tosora fell to the Bon\u00e9-led forces in December 1670. La Tenrilai was [[killed in action]], and his successor [[La Paliliq To Malu]] (r. 1670\u20131679) was forced to sign a treaty restricting Wajorese political, trade and military powers, in addition to the Treaty of Bungaya.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=140\u2013141}} In spite of Wajoq's surrender, it still faced harsh retribution from Arung Palakka and the people of Bon\u00e9.

By this time, Arung Palakka had been sending soldiers to help the VOC in [[Trunajaya rebellion|a campaign in Java]], and the VOC did not want to risk severing their relationship with an important ally.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfnp|Andaya|pp=142\u2013143, 190\u2013192, 205}}\n\nIt was these difficulties faced by the Wajorese in their homeland which prompted them to emigrate elsewhere.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}} While migration had always been an important part of Wajorese culture, it was particularly prominent in the aftermath of the Makassar War, when a large number of Wajorese migrants established themselves abroad in Makassar, eastern [[Borneo]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and the [[Straits of Malacca]] area, among other places.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=38, 82}}{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} These diaspora communities were connected to their homeland as well as to each other by familial, commercial, political and legal ties.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} By the early 18th century, a sequence of Wajorese rulers had began to take advantage of these connections to revitalize their country.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\n<!--Arung matoa is the highest...-->In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district.

The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on 9 March 1927, the same day it went into effect.<ref>[https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2060/v60.pdf ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 60], pp. 254\u2013270.</ref> The objective of the Convention was to confirm and advance the suppression of [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]].\n\n==Background==\nIn the [[Brussels Conference Act of 1890|Brussels Conference Act of 1891]] \n\nthe signatories \"declared that they were equally animated by the firm intention of putting an end to the [[human trafficking|traffic]] in African [slaves].\" The Brussels Act was supplemented and revised by the Convention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed by the Allied Powers of the [[First World War]] on  September 10 1919,<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1922/19.html United States of America - Convention revising the General Act of Berlin, 26 February 1885, and of the General Act and the Declaration of Brussels, 2 July 1890, signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 10 September 1919 (1922) LNTSer 19; 8 LNTS 27]</ref> in which the signatories undertook to \"endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea.\" (Art.11)\n\nA Temporary Slavery Commission was appointed by the Council of the [[League of Nations]] in June 1924. The commission was mixed in composition including former colonial governors, as well as a [[Haitian people|Haitian]], and a representative from the [[International Labour Organization]]  [[Frederick Lugard]] was the British representative on the commission?\n\n==Significance==\nThe '''1926 Slavery Convention''' established concrete rules and articles to advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.\n\nSlavery was defined (Art.1) as: \n<blockquote>the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of [[ownership]] are exercised</blockquote> \nand the slave trade was defined as including:\n<blockquote>all acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or [[Trade|exchange]] of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.</blockquote>\n\n== Contents (summarised) ==\n<blockquote>'''Article 2'''<br />\nThe parties agreed to prevent and suppress the slave trade and to progressively bring about the complete elimination of slavery in all its forms.\n\n'''Article 6'''<br />\nThe parties undertook to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading, slaveholding, and enslavement.</blockquote>\n\n==Participants==\nAs of 2013, 99 countries have signed, [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|acceded to]], [[ratification|ratified]], [[Succession of states|succeeded to]] or otherwise committed to participation in the Convention (as amended) and its subsequent Protocol.

Please see this article's talk page for records of what was copied in and when. -->\n[[File:TheCallStage.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Call (organization)|The Call]] rally in 2008, [[Washington, D.C.]]. [[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \"fundamental\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]] interpretation of the Bible. These three categories are more fluid than Hunter's, so an individual could identify with only one or all three.{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[John C. Green]], a senior fellow at the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]], used polling data to separate evangelicals into three broad camps, which he labels as ''traditionalist'', ''centrist'' and ''modernist'':<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{Cite news| title=Evangelicals Debate the Meaning of 'Evangelical' | last=Luo | first=Michael |date=April 16, 2006 | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/weekinreview/16luo.html?_r=1&adxnnlx=1145227368-p%20hJwvCXS0qceSTw%20jLi8w&pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\n# Traditionalist evangelicals, characterized by high affinity for certain Protestant beliefs, (especially [[penal substitution]]ary atonement, [[Sola fide|justification by faith]], the [[Sola scriptura|authority of scripture]], the [[priesthood of all believers]], etc.) which, when fused with the highly political milieu of Western culture (especially American culture), has resulted in the political disposition that has been labeled the Christian right, with figures like [[Jerry Falwell]] and the television evangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as its most visible spokesmen.\n# Centrist evangelicals, described as socially conservative, mostly avoiding politics, who still support much of traditional Christian theology.\n# Modernist evangelicals, a small minority in the movement, have lower levels of church-attendance and \"have much more diversity in their beliefs\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nHistorian [[Molly Worthen]] writes that \"History\u2014rather than theology or politics\u2014is the most useful tool for pinning down today\u2019s evangelicals.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}} She finds that evangelicals share common origins in the religious revivals and moral crusades of the 18th and 19th centuries. She writes that \"Evangelical catchphrases like 'Bible-believing' and '[[born again]]' are modern translations of the [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]]' slogan ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and Pietists' emphasis on internal spiritual transformation.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}}\n\n==History==\n===18th century===\n[[File:Jonathan Edwards.jpg|thumb|upright|Jonathan Edwards was the most influential evangelical theologian in America during the 18th century{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}]]\n\nThe roots of American evangelicalism lie in the merger of three older [[Protestant]] traditions: New England [[Puritanism]], Continental [[Pietism]] and Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterianism]].{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Within their [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]], Puritans promoted experimental or experiential religion, arguing that saving [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] required an inward transformation.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=31}} This led Puritans to demand evidence of a [[Puritans#Conversion|conversion experience]] (in the form of a [[conversion narrative]]) before a convert was admitted to full church membership.{{Sfn|Youngs|1998|pp=40\u201341}} In the 1670s and 1680s, Puritan clergy began to promote religious [[Christian revival|revival]] in response to a perceived decline in religiosity.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Chapter 1, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 148\u2013152}} The Ulster Scots who immigrated to the American colonies in the 1700s brought with them their own revival tradition, specifically the practice of [[communion season]]s.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=31}} Pietism was a movement within the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches]] in Europe that emphasized a \"religion of the heart\": the ideal that faith was not simply acceptance of [[proposition]]al truth but was an emotional \"commitment of one's whole being to God\" in which one's life became dedicated to [[Self-denial|self-sacrificial]] ministry.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|pp=24\u201325}} Pietists promoted the formation of [[cell groups]] for [[Bible study (Christianity)|Bible study]], prayer and accountability.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=34}}\n\nThese three traditions were brought together with the [[First Great Awakening]], a series of revivals occurring in both Britain and its American Colonies during the 1730s and 1740s.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=27}} The Awakening began within the Congregational churches of New England. In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S. Kidd]], \"''seasons of revival'', or ''outpourings of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]'', and on ''converted sinners experiencing God's love personally''\" [emphasis in original].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=xiv}} Evangelicals believed in the \"[[new birth]]\"\u2014a discernible moment of conversion\u2014and that it was normal for a Christian to have [[assurance of faith]].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 66}} While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\".{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}} \n\nIts emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an [[egalitarian]] streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nUnlike the First Great Awakening which was largely [[Calvinist]] in orientation, the Second Great Awakening was more theologically diverse with [[Arminians]] (whose theology allowed for some [[Free will in theology|free will]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]) playing important roles.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world. Many evangelicals urged that Christians must engage the culture directly and constructively,<ref>{{Citation|last=Henry|first=Carl FH|title=The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism|date=August 29, 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080282661X|origyear=1947|edition=reprint|place=Grand Rapids|publisher=Eerdmans|ISBN=0-8028-2661-X}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} and they began to express reservations about being known to the world as ''fundamentalists''.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\").

[[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century.

In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S. Kidd]], \"''seasons of revival'', or ''outpourings of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]'', and on ''converted sinners experiencing God's love personally''\" [emphasis in original].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=xiv}} Evangelicals believed in the \"[[new birth]]\"\u2014a discernible moment of conversion\u2014and that it was normal for a Christian to have [[assurance of faith]].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 66}} While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\".{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}} \n\nIts emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an [[egalitarian]] streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nUnlike the First Great Awakening which was largely [[Calvinist]] in orientation, the Second Great Awakening was more theologically diverse with [[Arminians]] (whose theology allowed for some [[Free will in theology|free will]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]) playing important roles.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\").
