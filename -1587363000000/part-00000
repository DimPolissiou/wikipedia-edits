Local slaveholders routinely bought and sold African American children, women, and men in New Brunswick in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In this period, the Market-House was the center of commercial life in the city. It was located at the corner of Hiram Street and Queen Street (now Neilson Street) adjacent to the Raritan Wharf. The site was a place where residents of New Brunswick sold and traded their goods which made it an integral part of the city's economy. The Market-House also served as a site for regular slave auctions and sales.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1k3s9r0.9|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Armstead|first=Shaun|last2=Sutter|first2=Brenann|last3=Walker|first3=Pamela|last4=Wiesner|first4=Caitlin|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Fuentes|editor-first=Marisa|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=|chapter=\"And I Poor Slave Yet\": The Precarity of Black Life in New Brunswick, 1766\u20131835|editor-last2=White|editor-first2=Deborah Gray}}</ref>{{Rp|101}}\n\nBy the late-eighteenth century, New Brunswick became a hub for newspaper production and distribution. ''The Fredonian'', a popular newspaper, was located less than a block away from the aforementioned Market-House and helped facilitate commercial transactions. A prominent part of the local newspapers were sections dedicated to private owners who would advertise their slaves for sale. The trend of advertising slave sales in newspapers shows that the New Brunswick residents typically preferred selling and buying slaves privately and individually rather than in large groups.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession />{{Rp|103}} The majority of individual advertisements were for female slaves, and their average age at the time of the sale was 20 years old, which was considered the prime age for childbearing. Slave owners would get the most profit from the women who fit into this category because these women had the potential to reproduce another generation of enslaved workers. Additionally, in the urban environment of New Brunswick, there was a high demand for domestic labor, and female workers were preferred for cooking and housework tasks.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession />{{Rp|107}}\n\nThe [[New Jersey Legislature]] passed An Act for the [[History of slavery in New Jersey#Abolition of slavery|Gradual Abolition of Slavery]] in 1804.<ref>[http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/slavery/acts/A78.html An act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery], [[Rutgers University Libraries]].

However, all individuals who were enslaved before July 4, 1804, would continue to be slaves for life and would never attain freedom under this law. New Brunswick continued to be home to enslaved African Americans alongside a growing community of free people of color.

Halfpenny Town was a place populated by free blacks and poorer white people who did not own slaves.

Sometimes these meetings were held at the First Presbyterian Church. Originally intended to provide financial support for the African School of New Brunswick, the African Association grew into a space where blacks could congregate and share ideas on a variety of topics such as religion, abolition and colonization. Slaves were required to obtain a pass from their owner in order to attend these meetings.

By 1827, free and enslaved Black people in the city, including Joseph and Jane Hoagland, came together to establish the Mount Zion [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and purchased a plot of land on Division Street for the purpose of erecting a church building. This was the first African American church in Middlesex County. The church had approximately 30 members in its early years. The church is still in operation and is currently located at 39 Hildebrand Way. The street Hildebrand Way is named after the late Rev.

Local slaveholders routinely bought and sold African American children, women, and men in New Brunswick in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In this period, the Market-House was the center of commercial life in the city. It was located at the corner of Hiram Street and Queen Street (now Neilson Street) adjacent to the Raritan Wharf. The site was a place where residents of New Brunswick sold and traded their goods which made it an integral part of the city's economy. The Market-House also served as a site for regular slave auctions and sales.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1k3s9r0.9|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Armstead|first=Shaun|last2=Sutter|first2=Brenann|last3=Walker|first3=Pamela|last4=Wiesner|first4=Caitlin|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Fuentes|editor-first=Marisa|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=|chapter=\"And I Poor Slave Yet\": The Precarity of Black Life in New Brunswick, 1766\u20131835|editor-last2=White|editor-first2=Deborah Gray}}</ref>{{Rp|101}}\n\nBy the late-eighteenth century, New Brunswick became a hub for newspaper production and distribution. ''The Fredonian'', a popular newspaper, was located less than a block away from the aforementioned Market-House and helped facilitate commercial transactions. A prominent part of the local newspapers were sections dedicated to private owners who would advertise their slaves for sale. The trend of advertising slave sales in newspapers shows that the New Brunswick residents typically preferred selling and buying slaves privately and individually rather than in large groups.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession />{{Rp|103}} The majority of individual advertisements were for female slaves, and their average age at the time of the sale was 20 years old, which was considered the prime age for childbearing. Slave owners would get the most profit from the women who fit into this category because these women had the potential to reproduce another generation of enslaved workers. Additionally, in the urban environment of New Brunswick, there was a high demand for domestic labor, and female workers were preferred for cooking and housework tasks.<ref name=SlaveryAndDispossession />{{Rp|107}}\n\nThe [[New Jersey Legislature]] passed An Act for the [[History of slavery in New Jersey#Abolition of slavery|Gradual Abolition of Slavery]] in 1804.<ref>[http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/slavery/acts/A78.html An act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery], [[Rutgers University Libraries]].

However, all individuals who were enslaved before July 4, 1804, would continue to be slaves for life and would never attain freedom under this law. New Brunswick continued to be home to enslaved African Americans alongside a growing community of free people of color.

Halfpenny Town was a place populated by free blacks and poorer white people who did not own slaves.

Sometimes these meetings were held at the First Presbyterian Church. Originally intended to provide financial support for the African School of New Brunswick, the African Association grew into a space where blacks could congregate and share ideas on a variety of topics such as religion, abolition and colonization. Slaves were required to obtain a pass from their owner in order to attend these meetings.

By 1827, free and enslaved Black people in the city, including Joseph and Jane Hoagland, came together to establish the Mount Zion [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and purchased a plot of land on Division Street for the purpose of erecting a church building. This was the first African American church in Middlesex County. The church had approximately 30 members in its early years.

It was first published in English in 1970, in a translation by Myra Ramos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pedagogyoftheoppressed.com/about/|title=About Pedagogy of the Oppressed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012165910/http://www.pedagogyoftheoppressed.com/about/|archivedate=2011-10-12|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref> The book is considered one of the foundational texts of [[critical pedagogy]], and proposes a [[pedagogy]] with a new relationship between teacher, student, and society. \n\nDedicated to the oppressed and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] [[class analysis]] in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. In the book, Freire calls traditional pedagogy the \"[[banking model of education]]\" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a [[piggy bank]]. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe book has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide.<ref>Publisher's Foreword in Freire, Paulo (2000). ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum, p. 9.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFreire organizes the ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' into 4 chapters and a preface.\n\n'''Preface'''\n\nFreire uses the preface to provide a background to his work and the potential downsides. He explains that this came from his experience as a teacher in Brazil and when he was in political exile. In this time, he noticed that his students had an unconscious fear of freedom, or rather: a fear of changing the way the world is. Freire then outlines the likely criticisms his book will face. Furthermore, his audience should be radicals- people that see the world as changing and fluid, and he admits his argument will most likely be missing things. Basing his method of finding freedom on the poor and middle class\u2019s experience with education, Freire states that his ideas are rooted in reality- not purely theoretical\n\n'''Chapter 1'''\n\nFreire utilizes this chapter to explain why this pedagogy is necessary. Describing humankind\u2019s central problem as affirming one\u2019s identity as human, Freire states that everyone strives for this, but oppression interrupts many people on this journey. These halts are termed dehumanization. Dehumanization, when individuals become objectified, occurs due to injustice, exploitation, and oppression. The ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' is Freire\u2019s attempt to help the oppressed fight back to regain their lost humanity and achieve full humanization. There exist many steps for this process. First of which, is for the oppressed to understand what humanization truly is. It is easy for the oppressed to fight to become polar opposites of what they currently are. However, this just makes them the oppressors and starts the cycle all over again. To be fully human again, they must identify the oppressors. They must identify them and work together to seek liberation. The next step in liberation is to understand what the goal of the oppressors is. Oppressors are purely materialistic. They see humans as objects and by suppressing individuals, they are able to own these humans. While they may not be consciously putting down the oppressed, they value ownership over humanity, essentially dehumanizing themselves. This is important to realize as the goal of the oppressed is to not only gain power. It is to allow all individuals to become fully human so that no oppression can exist. Freire states that once the oppressed understand their own oppression and discovers their oppressors, the next step is dialogue, or discussion with others to reach the goal of humanization. Freire also highlights other events on this journey that the oppressed must undertake. There are many situations that the oppressed must keep wary about. For example, they must be aware of the oppressors trying to help the oppressed. These people are deemed falsely generous, and in order to help the oppressed, one must first fully become the oppressed, mentally and environmentally. Only the oppressed can allow humanity to become fully human with no instances of objectification. \n\n'''Chapter 2'''\n\nIn chapter 2, Freire outlines his theories of education. The first discussed is the banking model of education. He believes the fundamental nature of education is to be narrative. There is one individual reciting facts and ideas (the teacher) and others that just listen and memorize everything (the students). There is no connection with their real life, resulting in a very passive learning style. This form of education is termed the banking model of education. The banking model is very closely linked with oppression. It is built on the fact that the teacher knows all, and there exist inferiors that must just accept what they are told. They are not allowed to question the world or their teachers. This lack of freedom highlights the comparisons between the banking model of education and oppression. Freire urges the dismissal of the banking model of education and the adoption of the problem-posing model. This model encourages a discussion between teacher and student. It fades the line between the two as everyone learns alongside each other, creating equality and the lack of oppression. There are many ways the banking model of education aligns with oppression. Essentially, it dehumanizes the student. If they are raised to learn to be blank slates molded by the teacher, they will never be able to question the world if they need to. This form of education encourages them to just accept what is thrust upon them and accept that as correct. It makes the first step of humanization very difficult. If they are trained to be passive listeners, they will never be able to come to the realization that there even exists oppressors.\n\n'''Chapter 3'''\n\nThis chapter is used to expand on Freire\u2019s idea of dialogue. He first explains the importance of words, and that they must reflect both action and reflection. Dialogue is an understanding between different people and it is an act of love, humility, and faith. It provides others the complete independence to experience the world and name it how they see it. Freire explains that educators shape how students see the world and history. They must use language with the point of view of the students in mind. They must allow \u201cthematic investigation:\u201d the discovery of different relevant problems and ideas for different periods of time. This ability is the difference between animals and humans. Animals are stuck in the present unlike humans who understand history and use it to shape the present. Freire explains that the oppressed usually are not able to see the problems of their own time, and oppressors feed on this ignorance. Freire also presses the importance of educators not becoming oppressors and not objectifying their students. Educators and students must work as a team to find the problems of history and the present.\n\n'''Chapter 4'''\n\nIn this chapter, Freire lays out the process of how the oppressed can truly liberate themselves.\u00a0 He explains the methods used by oppressors to suppress humanity and the actions the oppressed can undertake in order to liberate humanity. The tools the oppressed use are termed, \u201canti-dialogical actions,\u201d and the ways the oppressed can overcome them are, \u201cdialogical actions.\u201d The four anti-dialogical actions include conquest, manipulation, divide and rule, and cultural invasion. The four dialogical actions, on the other hand, are unity, compassion, organization, and cultural synthesis.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Spread==\nThe book was first published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation in 1968.

In the book, Freire calls traditional pedagogy the \"[[banking model of education]]\" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a [[piggy bank]]. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe book has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide.<ref>Publisher's Foreword in Freire, Paulo (2000). ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum, p. 9.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFreire organizes the ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' into 4 chapters and a preface.\n\n'''Preface'''\n\nFreire uses the preface to provide a background to his work and the potential downsides. He explains that this came from his experience as a teacher in Brazil and when he was in political exile. In this time, he noticed that his students had an unconscious fear of freedom, or rather: a fear of changing the way the world is. Freire then outlines the likely criticisms his book will face. Furthermore, his audience should be radicals- people that see the world as changing and fluid, and he admits his argument will most likely be missing things. Basing his method of finding freedom on the poor and middle class\u2019s experience with education, Freire states that his ideas are rooted in reality- not purely theoretical\n\n'''Chapter 1'''\n\nFreire utilizes this chapter to explain why this pedagogy is necessary. Describing humankind\u2019s central problem as affirming one\u2019s identity as human, Freire states that everyone strives for this, but oppression interrupts many people on this journey. These halts are termed dehumanization. Dehumanization, when individuals become objectified, occurs due to injustice, exploitation, and oppression. The ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' is Freire\u2019s attempt to help the oppressed fight back to regain their lost humanity and achieve full humanization. There exist many steps for this process. First of which, is for the oppressed to understand what humanization truly is. It is easy for the oppressed to fight to become polar opposites of what they currently are. However, this just makes them the oppressors and starts the cycle all over again. To be fully human again, they must identify the oppressors. They must identify them and work together to seek liberation. The next step in liberation is to understand what the goal of the oppressors is. Oppressors are purely materialistic. They see humans as objects and by suppressing individuals, they are able to own these humans. While they may not be consciously putting down the oppressed, they value ownership over humanity, essentially dehumanizing themselves. This is important to realize as the goal of the oppressed is to not only gain power. It is to allow all individuals to become fully human so that no oppression can exist. Freire states that once the oppressed understand their own oppression and discovers their oppressors, the next step is dialogue, or discussion with others to reach the goal of humanization. Freire also highlights other events on this journey that the oppressed must undertake. There are many situations that the oppressed must keep wary about. For example, they must be aware of the oppressors trying to help the oppressed. These people are deemed falsely generous, and in order to help the oppressed, one must first fully become the oppressed, mentally and environmentally. Only the oppressed can allow humanity to become fully human with no instances of objectification. \n\n'''Chapter 2'''\n\nIn chapter 2, Freire outlines his theories of education. The first discussed is the banking model of education. He believes the fundamental nature of education is to be narrative. There is one individual reciting facts and ideas (the teacher) and others that just listen and memorize everything (the students). There is no connection with their real life, resulting in a very passive learning style. This form of education is termed the banking model of education. The banking model is very closely linked with oppression. It is built on the fact that the teacher knows all, and there exist inferiors that must just accept what they are told. They are not allowed to question the world or their teachers. This lack of freedom highlights the comparisons between the banking model of education and oppression. Freire urges the dismissal of the banking model of education and the adoption of the problem-posing model. This model encourages a discussion between teacher and student. It fades the line between the two as everyone learns alongside each other, creating equality and the lack of oppression. There are many ways the banking model of education aligns with oppression. Essentially, it dehumanizes the student. If they are raised to learn to be blank slates molded by the teacher, they will never be able to question the world if they need to. This form of education encourages them to just accept what is thrust upon them and accept that as correct. It makes the first step of humanization very difficult. If they are trained to be passive listeners, they will never be able to come to the realization that there even exists oppressors.\n\n'''Chapter 3'''\n\nThis chapter is used to expand on Freire\u2019s idea of dialogue. He first explains the importance of words, and that they must reflect both action and reflection. Dialogue is an understanding between different people and it is an act of love, humility, and faith. It provides others the complete independence to experience the world and name it how they see it. Freire explains that educators shape how students see the world and history. They must use language with the point of view of the students in mind. They must allow \u201cthematic investigation:\u201d the discovery of different relevant problems and ideas for different periods of time. This ability is the difference between animals and humans. Animals are stuck in the present unlike humans who understand history and use it to shape the present. Freire explains that the oppressed usually are not able to see the problems of their own time, and oppressors feed on this ignorance. Freire also presses the importance of educators not becoming oppressors and not objectifying their students. Educators and students must work as a team to find the problems of history and the present.\n\n'''Chapter 4'''\n\nIn this chapter, Freire lays out the process of how the oppressed can truly liberate themselves.\u00a0 He explains the methods used by oppressors to suppress humanity and the actions the oppressed can undertake in order to liberate humanity. The tools the oppressed use are termed, \u201canti-dialogical actions,\u201d and the ways the oppressed can overcome them are, \u201cdialogical actions.\u201d The four anti-dialogical actions include conquest, manipulation, divide and rule, and cultural invasion. The four dialogical actions, on the other hand, are unity, compassion, organization, and cultural synthesis<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n==Spread==\nThe book was first published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation in 1968.

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]] and [[semiconductor]]. It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table: [[carbon]] is above it; and [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. <!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.--> Its melting and boiling points of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by [[boron]]. Silicon is the eighth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|common element]] in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicates are used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.\n\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the [[Digital Age]] or [[Information Age]]) due to elemental silicon having a large impact on the modern world economy. The relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in [[semiconductor electronics]] (< 10%) is essential to the [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon]] (MOS) [[transistors]] and [[integrated circuit]] chips used in most modern technology (such as [[computers]] and [[cell phones]], for example). The most widely used silicon device is the [[MOSFET]] (metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor), which has been manufactured in larger numbers than any other device in history. Free silicon is also used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]).\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.<ref name=\"Cutter\">{{cite book|last=Cutter|first=Elizabeth G.|title=Plant Anatomy.

Silicon [[rock crystal]]s were familiar to various [[ancient civilizations]], such as the [[predynastic Egypt]]ians who used it for [[beads]] and small [[vases]], as well as the [[Ancient China|ancient Chinese]]. [[Glass]] containing [[silica]] was manufactured by the [[Egyptians]] since at least 1500 BC, as well as by the ancient [[Phoenicians]].

About these \"elements\", Lavoisier speculates: \"We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies.

In both cases, pure silicon was produced: the silicon dissolved in the molten aluminium, but crystallized upon cooling. Dissolving the crude aluminum in hydrochloric acid revealed flakes of crystallized silicon.

In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup>. Of these, four are [[valence electron]]s, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter [[carbon]] and the heavier [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]], it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [[octet rule|octet]] and obtain the stable [[noble gas]] configuration of [[argon]] by forming [[orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals]], forming tetrahedral SiX<sub>4</sub> derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.<ref name=King0>King, pp. xiii\u2013xviii</ref> The first four [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4&nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following [[periodic trend]]s, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6&nbsp;pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2&nbsp;pm) and germanium (122.3&nbsp;pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40&nbsp;pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple Si<sup>4+</sup> cation in reality.<ref name=Greenwood372>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 372</ref>\n\n====Electrical====\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny [[semiconductor]] with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap ([[band gap]]) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The [[Fermi level]] is about halfway between the [[valence and conduction bands]] and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] silicon with a [[pnictogen]] such as [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type semiconductor]]. Similarly, doping silicon with a [[boron group|group 13 element]] such as [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]] results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type semiconductor]].<ref name=Greenwood331/> ((<!-- this could be move to electronic applications --> Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a [[p-n junction]] with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [[diode]] that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A [[transistor]] is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a [[triode]] amplifier.<ref name=Greenwood331/>))\n\n====Crystal structure====\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40&nbsp;[[gigapascal]]s known as Si\u2013VII (the standard modification being Si\u2013I). Silicon boils at 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642&nbsp;\u00b0C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si\u2013Si bond is weaker than the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood331/>\n\nIt is also possible to construct [[silicene]] layers analogous to [[graphene]].<ref name=Aufray2010/><ref name=Lalmi2010/>\n\n===Isotopes===\n{{Main|Isotopes of silicon}}\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>28</sup>Si (92.23%), <sup>29</sup>Si (4.67%), and <sup>30</sup>Si (3.10%).{{NUBASE2016|ref}} Out of these, only <sup>29</sup>Si is of use in [[NMR]] and [[EPR spectroscopy]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi|accessdate = 2011-10-20| title = Interactive NMR Frequency Map| author =Jerschow, Alexej|publisher = New York University}}</ref> as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}).<ref name=Greenwood330>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 330\u2013331</ref> All three are produced in stars through the [[oxygen-burning process]], with <sup>28</sup>Si being made as part of the [[alpha process]] and hence the most abundant.

Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, but formation of the [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] dioxide rapidly increases between 950&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1160&nbsp;\u00b0C and when 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C is reached, atmospheric [[nitrogen]] also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Silicon reacts with gaseous [[sulfur]] at 600&nbsp;\u00b0C and gaseous [[phosphorus]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [[halogen]]s; [[fluorine]] attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, [[chlorine]] does so at about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] at about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form [[silicate]]s. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with [[alkyl halide]]s; this reaction may be catalysed by [[copper]] to directly synthesise [[organosilicon]] chlorides as precursors to [[silicone]] polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form [[silicide]]s, and reducing most metal oxides because the [[heat of formation]] of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of [[refractory]], unreactive materials such as [[zirconium dioxide]] or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.<ref name=Greenwood331>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 331\u2013335</ref>\n\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon,<ref name=Kaupp>{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/LecturasobreNodosRadiales_12854.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320\u2013325 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=14 October 2016|bibcode=1984JCoCh...5..500B }}</ref> and thus octahedral coordination is also significant.<ref name=Greenwood331/> For example, the [[electronegativity]] of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward [[catenation]] (formation of Si\u2013Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si\u2013Si bond compared to the C\u2013C bond:<ref name=King43>King, pp. 43\u201344</ref> the average Si\u2013Si bond energy is approximately 226&nbsp;kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356&nbsp;kJ/mol for the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood374>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 374</ref> This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the [[double bond rule]]. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of [[hypervalence]], as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as {{chem|SiX|5|-}} and {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King43/> Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a [[metalloid]] rather than a nonmetal.<ref name=King43/> However, metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.<ref name=Greenwood328/>\n\nSilicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, [[organic chemistry]] has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while [[silicate]] minerals have a structural complexity unseen in [[oxocarbon]]s.<ref name=Greenwood328>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 328\u2013329</ref> Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [[d-block contraction]], resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict.<ref name=Greenwood372/> Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon, which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge\u2013O bond strength compared to the Si\u2013O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\" polymers that would be analogous to [[silicone]] polymers.<ref name=Greenwood374/>\n\n===Silicides===\n{{main|Silicide|Binary compounds of silicon}}\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Fe Si analyse thermique 30.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Phase diagram of the Fe\u2013Si system]]\nMany metal [[silicide]]s are known, most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]: their bonding ranges from [[metallic bond|metallic]] to [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]]. Some known stoichiometries are M<sub>6</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si, M<sub>4</sub>Si, M<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, MSi, M<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, MSi<sub>2</sub>, MSi<sub>3</sub>, and MSi<sub>6</sub>. They are structurally more similar to the [[boride]]s than the [[carbide]]s, in keeping with the [[diagonal relationship]] between [[boron]] and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures.<ref name=Greenwood335>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 335\u2013337</ref> Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1\u201310, with the exception of [[beryllium]]: in particular, [[uranium]] and the transition metals of groups 4\u201310 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [[copper]], the metals in groups 11\u201315 do not form silicides. Instead, most form [[eutectic mixture]]s, although the heaviest [[post-transition metal]]s [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]] are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nUsually, silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For example, the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and most of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides {{chem|(M|+|)|4|(Si|4|4-|)}} contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the {{chem|Si|4|4-}} anion, isoelectronic with [[white phosphorus]], P<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood335/><ref name=King45>King, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e. g. Cu<sub>5</sub>Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e. g. U<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>) or four silicon atoms (e. g. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>4</sub>[Si<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>) at first, followed by chains (e. g. CaSi), layers (e. g. CaSi<sub>2</sub>), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e. g. \u03b1-ThSi<sub>2</sub>) as the silicon content rises even higher.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nThe silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents, except for [[hydrofluoric acid]]; however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid [[potassium hydroxide]], or gaseous fluorine or [[chlorine]] when red-hot. The pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n:Na<sub>2</sub>Si + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n:Mg<sub>2</sub>Si + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> + SiH<sub>4</sub>\nProducts often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl<sub>2</sub> structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [[calcium hydroxide]], hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH<sub>2</sub>, while CaSi<sub>2</sub> with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\n===Silanes===\n{{main|Silanes}}\nSpeculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the 1830s, contemporary with the development of synthetic [[organic chemistry]]. [[Silane]] itself, as well as [[trichlorosilane]], were first synthesised by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] and [[Heinrich Buff]] in 1857 by reacting aluminium\u2013silicon alloys with [[hydrochloric acid]], and characterised as SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiHCl<sub>3</sub> by [[Charles Friedel]] and [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1867. [[Disilane]] (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) followed in 1902, when it was first made by [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Samuel Smiles]] by the [[protonolysis]] of [[magnesium silicide]]s. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [[Alfred Stock]] began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the [[borane|boron hydrides]]. The names ''silanes'' and ''boranes'' are his, based on analogy with the [[alkane]]s.<ref name=Greenwood337/><ref>E. Wiber, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1977/pdf/4906x0691.pdf Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry],\" ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691\u2013700.</ref><ref>J. W. Mellor, \"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry,\" Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223\u2013227.</ref> The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes.<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nThe silanes comprise a [[homologous series]] of silicon hydrides with a general formula of Si<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>. They are all strong [[reducing agent]]s. Unbranched and branched chains are known up to ''n''=8, and the cycles Si<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months).<ref name=Greenwood337/> They decompose to form polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and hydrogen gas.<ref>W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.\", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.</ref><ref>Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844.</ref> As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more so than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si\u2013H bond compared to the C\u2013H bond, and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [[activation energy]].<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nSilane [[pyrolysis]] gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C\u2013H or C\u2013C bond and the formation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating [[silylene]]s :SiH<sub>2</sub> or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210&nbsp;kJ/mol) is much less than the Si\u2013Si and Si\u2013H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in [[methanol]], controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH<sub>2</sub>(OMe)<sub>2</sub>, SiH(OMe)<sub>3</sub>, and Si(OMe)<sub>4</sub>. The Si\u2013H bond also adds to [[alkene]]s, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450&nbsp;\u00b0C, silane participates in an [[addition reaction]] with [[acetone]], as well as a [[ring-opening reaction]] with [[ethylene oxide]]. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate [[hydrogen halide]] with an Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid [[silver]] halide in a heated flow reactor:<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2 AgCl {{overunderset|\u2192|260&nbsp;\u00b0C|&nbsp;}} SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl + 2 Ag\nAmong the derivatives of silane, [[iodosilane]] (SiH<sub>3</sub>I) and [[potassium silanide]] (KSiH<sub>3</sub>) are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing K<sup>+</sup> cations and {{chem|SiH|3|-}} anions in the [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] structure, and is made by the reduction of silane by [[potassium]] metal.<ref name=King47>King, p. 47</ref> Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species {{chem|SiH|5|-}} is also known.<ref name=Greenwood337/> With suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric conductivities, arising from [[sigma bond|sigma]] delocalisation of the electrons in the chain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=R.D. |last2=Michl |first2=J. |doi=10.1021/cr00096a006 |title=Polysilane high polymers |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |volume=89 |issue=6| pages=1359 |year=1989 |pmid= |pmc =}}</ref>\n\n===Halides===\nSilicon and [[silicon carbide]] readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive, and volatile silicon tetrahalides.<ref name=Greenwood340>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 340\u20132</ref> [[Silicon tetrafluoride]] also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on glass.<ref name=King48/> Heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr<sub>3</sub> through SiFClBr<sub>2</sub> to SiFCl<sub>2</sub>Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in [[aluminium fluoride]] to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.<ref name=Greenwood340/> [[Silicon tetrachloride]] is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [[ester]]s.<ref name=Greenwood340/> The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.<ref name=King48>King, p. 48</ref> The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess [[hydrofluoric acid]] produces the octahedral [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|hexafluorosilicate]] anion {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King48/>\n\nAnalogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si<sub>''n''</sub>X<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub> also are known. While catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si<sub>14</sub>F<sub>30</sub>, Si<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>14</sub>, and Si<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [[pi backbonding]] from the filled p<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of [[carbon monoxide]] in [[metal carbonyl complex]]es and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by [[comproportionation]] of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes ([[trimethylammonium]] being a useful catalyst for this reaction).<ref name=Greenwood340/>\n\n===Silica===\n[[Silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), also known as silica, is one of the best-studied compounds, second only to [[properties of water|water]]. Twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being \u03b1-[[quartz]], a major constituent of many rocks such as [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. It also is known to occur in a pure form as [[rock crystal]]; impure forms are known as [[rose quartz]], [[smoky quartz]], [[morion (mineral)|morion]], [[amethyst]], and [[citrine quartz|citrine]]. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[carnelian]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[flint]]. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]], as well as the much less common [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Biologically generated forms are also known as [[kieselguhr]] and [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Vitrification|Vitreous]] silicon dioxide is known as [[tektite]]s, and [[obsidian]], and rarely as [[lechatelierite]]. Some synthetic forms are known as [[keatite]] and [[W-silica]]. [[Opal]]s are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood342>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 342\u2013347</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|Quartz\nFile:Quartz - Agateplate, redbrown-white.jpg|Agate\nFile:Tridymite tabulars - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|Tridymite\nFile:Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg|Cristobalite\nFile:Coesiteimage.jpg|Coesite\n</gallery>\n\nMost crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra (with Si at the center) connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, \u03b1-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si\u2013O distances (159.7 and 161.7&nbsp;pm) with a Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle of 144\u00b0. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual \u03b1-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537&nbsp;\u00b0C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar \u03b2-quartz, with a change of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle to 155\u00b0 but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867&nbsp;\u00b0C results in another reversible phase transition to \u03b2-tridymite, in which some Si\u2013O bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120&nbsp;\u00b0C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to \u03b1-tridymite, similarly to the transition from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz. \u03b2-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic \u03b2-cristobalite at about 1470&nbsp;\u00b0C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200\u2013280&nbsp;\u00b0C to \u03b1-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. \u03b2-cristobalite melts at 1713&nbsp;\u00b0C; the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and [[vitrification]], or the formation of a [[glass]], is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt \u03b2-quartz (1550&nbsp;\u00b0C) or \u03b2-tridymite (1703&nbsp;\u00b0C). Silica boils at approximately 2800&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following [[lightning]] strikes, forming glassy [[lechatelierite]]. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to [[silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) and [[silicon diselenide]] (SiSe<sub>2</sub>): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430 H2SiO3.JPG|thumb|Condensed polysilicic acid]]\nSilica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates, to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and [[metalloid]] oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, [[sodium silicate]] is often used in detergents due to its [[buffer (chemistry)|buffering]], [[saponification|saponifying]], and [[emulsification|emulsifying]] properties.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicic acids===\nAdding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800&nbsp;\u00b0C due to the breaking of the structure by replacing Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages with terminating Si\u2013OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated [[silica gel]]s and [[colloid]]al silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [[silicic acid]]s exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula [SiO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>4\u22122''x''</sub>]<sub>''n''</sub>, similar to the behaviour of [[boron]], [[aluminium]], and [[iron]], among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [[orthosilicic acid]] Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> and [[metasilicic acid]] SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicate minerals===\n{{main|Silicate minerals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" | Typical coordination of metal cations in silicates (ionic radii in [[picometre|pm]])<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n|-\n!

Tetrahedral {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into ''neso''-silicates (discrete {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, ''soro''-silicates (discrete {Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>} units) sharing one, ''cyclo''-silicates (closed ring structures) and ''ino''-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, ''phyllo''-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and ''tecto''-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed, or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.<ref name=Greenwood347>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 347\u2013359</ref>\n\nThe [[orthosilicate]]s M{{su|p=II|b=2}}SiO{{su|b=4}} (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> are ''neso''-silicates. Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> ([[phenacite]]) is unusual as both Be<sup>II</sup> and Si<sup>IV</sup> occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe,Mn)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. [[Zircon]], ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, demands eight-coordination of the Zr<sup>IV</sup> cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84&nbsp;pm). Also significant are the [[garnet]]s, [M{{su|p=II|b=3}}M{{su|p=III|b=2}}(SiO{{su|b=4}}){{su|b=3}}], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for Ca<sup>II</sup>. ''Soro''-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic \"[(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>]<sup>2''n''\u2212</sup>\" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\nChain metasilicates, {SiO{{su|p=2\u2212|b=3}}}{{su|b=\u221e}}, form by corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most [[pyroxene]] minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in the [[asbestos]] minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|A typical zeolite structure]]\nLayer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [[mica]]s, are very common, and often are formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is [[kaolinite]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]; in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral Si<sup>IV</sup> may be replaced by Al<sup>III</sup>, octahedral Al<sup>III</sup> by Mg<sup>II</sup>, and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> by F<sup>\u2212</sup>. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO<sub>2</sub> structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the Si<sup>IV</sup> atoms with Al<sup>III</sup>, they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include [[feldspar]]s (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), [[zeolite]]s, and [[ultramarine]]s. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting Al<sup>III</sup> to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]], which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition, but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks ([[truncated cuboctahedron|truncated cuboctahedra]] being most common, but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{chem|SO|4|2-}}, and {{chem|S|2|2-}}, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n===Other inorganic compounds===\n[[Silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C; sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibers reminiscent of [[asbestos]] with a structure similar to W-silica. This melts at 1090&nbsp;\u00b0C and sublimes at 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C; at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite. However, SiS<sub>2</sub> lacks the variety of structures of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and quickly hydrolyses to silica and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It is also ammonolysed quickly and completely by liquid [[ammonia]] as follows to form an [[imide]]:<ref name=Greenwood359>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 359\u2013361</ref>\n:SiS<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si(NH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>SH\nIt reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal [[thiosilicate]]s: reaction with [[ethanol]] results in [[tetraethylsilicate]] Si(OEt)<sub>4</sub> and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)<sub>3</sub>, cyclic Cl<sub>2</sub>Si(\u03bc-S)<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, and crystalline (SiSCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Despite the [[double bond rule]], stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an [[amine]] group.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[Silicon nitride]], Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. It would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it: chemically, it is near-totally inert, and even above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]]), dissociates only at 1900&nbsp;\u00b0C at 1&nbsp;atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). A similar refractory material is Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450&nbsp;\u00b0C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages to each other.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\nReacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which are silicon analogues of the [[amine]]s:<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n:3 SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl\n:SiH<sub>3</sub>Br + 2 Me<sub>2</sub>NH \u2192 SiH<sub>3</sub>NMe<sub>2</sub> + Me<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>Br\n:4 SiH<sub>3</sub>I + 5 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> \u2192 (SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I\n\nMany such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH\u2013NH group are unstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>is planar, which has been attributed to a p<sub>\u03c0</sub>\u2013d<sub>\u03c0</sub> interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbital on silicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues, the tertiary [[amine]]s, although substitution of some SiH<sub>3</sub> groups by CH<sub>3</sub> groups mitigates this weakness. For example, N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> does not form an [[adduct]] with [[borane|BH<sub>3</sub>]] at all, while MeN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Me<sub>2</sub>NSiH<sub>3</sub> form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon analogues of [[imine]]s, with a Si=N double bond, are known: the first found was Bu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>2</sub>Si=N\u2013SiBu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>3</sub>, which was discovered in 1986.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon carbide]]\n[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) was first made by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between [[diamond]] (an allotrope of carbon) and [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]).

It is resistant to most aqueous acids, [[phosphoric acid]] being an exception. It forms a protective layer of [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl<sub>4</sub> and carbon at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and SiCl<sub>4</sub> and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.<ref name=Greenwood334/> In its diamond-like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Organosilicon compounds===\n{{main|Organosilicon}}\n[[Image:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|A hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si\u2013H is added to an unsaturated substrate]]\nBecause the Si\u2013C bond is close in strength to the C\u2013C bond, organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, [[tetraphenylsilane]] (SiPh<sub>4</sub>) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428&nbsp;\u00b0C, and so may its substituted derivatives Ph<sub>3</sub>SiCl and Ph<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, which boil at 378&nbsp;\u00b0C and 305&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds.<ref name=Greenwood361>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 361\u2013366</ref> However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si\u2013F bond is significantly stronger than even the [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond|C\u2013F bond]] and is one of the strongest single bonds, while the Si\u2013H bond is much weaker than the C\u2013H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] or [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si\u2013C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C\u2013O \u03c3* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called \"S<sub>N</sub>2 at silicon\" for simplicity.<ref name=Clayden668>Clayden, pp. 668\u201377</ref>\n\nOne of the most useful silicon-containing groups is [[trimethylsilyl]], Me<sub>3</sub>Si\u2013. The Si\u2013C bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the [[fluoride]] ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic [[proton]]s; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [[selenium]], or [[iodine]]), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in [[haloalkane]]s, but at the oxygen in [[silyl]] chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [[silyl ether]] [[hexamethyldisiloxane]], (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O. Conversely, while the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (\u03b4+) at the carbon, the analogous \"S<sub>N</sub>2\" reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl [[triflate]]s are so electrophilic that they react 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] is in particular a very good [[Lewis acid]] and is used to convert [[carbonyl]] compounds to [[acetal]]s and [[silyl enol ether]]s, reacting them together analogously to the [[aldol reaction]].<ref name=Clayden668/>\n\nSi\u2013C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with [[organolithium]], [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]], or [[organoaluminium]] reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si\u2013H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [[copper]] as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Silicone polymers===\n{{main|Silicone}}\n[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[polydimethylsiloxane]], the principal component of silicones]]\nThe word \"silicone\" was first used by Frederic Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO and [[benzophenone]], Ph<sub>2</sub>CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO, which is not shared by Ph<sub>2</sub>CO.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\nSilicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the [[isoelectronic]] O<sup>\u2212</sup> of the silicates.<ref name=Greenwood361/> They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally, may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]] oxyhalides, converting a [[tungsten hexachloride]] suspension in [[dichloroethane]] solution quantitatively to WOCl<sub>4</sub> in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg|thumb|upright|Olivine]]\nIn the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[neon]]. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the [[Solar System]]. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by [[planetary differentiation]]: [[Earth's core]], which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe<sub>25</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as [[aluminosilicate]]s rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.<ref name=Greenwood329>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\nThe crystallisation of [[igneous rock]]s from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as [[lattice energy]], melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, [[olivine]] appears first, followed by [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] mica, [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[muscovite mica]], [[quartz]], [[zeolite]]s, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of [[hydroxide]] and [[fluoride]] anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo [[weathering]], transport, and deposition, [[sedimentary rock]]s like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. [[Metamorphism]] also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.<ref name=Greenwood329/>\n\n==Production==\nSilicon of 96\u201399% purity is made by reducing [[quartzite]] or sand with highly pure [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. The reduction is carried out in an [[electric arc furnace]], with an excess of SiO<sub>2</sub> used to stop [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) from accumulating:<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n:2 SiC + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\n\n[[File:Ferrosilicon.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Ferrosilicon alloy]]\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], producing [[ferrosilicon]].<ref name=Greenwood330/> Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million [[tonne]]s (or 2/3 of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/mcs-2011-simet.pdf |publisher=USGS |title=Silicon Commodities Report 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.<ref name=Greenwood330/> Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:<ref name=Ullmann574>Zulehner et al., p. 574</ref>\n:3 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 Al \u2192 3 Si + 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nLeaching powdered 96\u201397% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of [[silicone]] production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated [[fractional distillation]], followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [[zinc]] metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by [[zone refining]]. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]], a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic [[sodium]]: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: [[transistor]] production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 10<sup>10</sup>, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 10<sup>12</sup> are needed and attained.<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n\n==Applications==\n===Compounds===\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.<ref name=Greenwood356>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 356.</ref>\n\nSilica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]], which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.\n\nSilicones often are used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.\n\n=== Alloys ===\nElemental silicon is added to molten [[cast iron]] as [[ferrosilicon]] or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of [[cementite]] where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.<ref name=\"diecasting\">Apelian, D.

Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a [[resistivity]]) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for [[transistor]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[semiconductor detector]]s, and other [[semiconductor device]]s used in the computer industry and other technical applications.<ref name=Ullmann573>Zulehner et al., p. 573</ref> In [[silicon photonics]], silicon may be used as a continuous wave [[Raman laser]] medium to produce coherent light.<ref name=\"dekker_2008\" >{{cite journal |title=Ultrafast nonlinear all-optical processes in silicon-on-insulator waveguides |journal=[[Journal of Physics D]] |year=2008 |volume=40 |issue=14 |page=R249\u2013R271 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/40/14/r01\n|bibcode=2007JPhD...40..249D |last1=Dekker |first1=R |last2=Usechak |first2=N |last3=F\u00f6rst |first3=M |last4=Driessen |first4=A}}</ref>\n\nIn common [[integrated circuit]]s, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of [[silicon dioxide|silicon oxide]], an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of [[thermal oxidation]] or [[LOCOS|local oxidation (LOCOS)]], which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions that can be predicted by the [[Deal\u2013Grove model]]. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia</ref>\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.<ref name=USGS>Corathers, Lisa A.

The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its [[highest occupied molecular orbital]] (HOMO) slightly higher than a valance band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the [[photocurrent]] emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.<ref>Yue, Zhao, Fred Lisdat, Wolfgang J. Parak, Stephen G.

It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table: [[carbon]] is above it; and [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. <!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.--> Its melting and boiling points of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by [[boron]].

It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicates are used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.\n\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the [[Digital Age]] or [[Information Age]]) due to elemental silicon having a large impact on the modern world economy. The relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in [[semiconductor electronics]] (< 10%) is essential to the [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon]] (MOS) [[transistors]] and [[integrated circuit]] chips used in most modern technology (such as [[computers]] and [[cell phones]], for example). The most widely used silicon device is the [[MOSFET]] (metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor), which has been manufactured in larger numbers than any other device in history. Free silicon is also used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]).\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.<ref name=\"Cutter\">{{cite book|last=Cutter|first=Elizabeth G.|title=Plant Anatomy.

It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies.

In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup>. Of these, four are [[valence electron]]s, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter [[carbon]] and the heavier [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]], it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [[octet rule|octet]] and obtain the stable [[noble gas]] configuration of [[argon]] by forming [[orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals]], forming tetrahedral SiX<sub>4</sub> derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.<ref name=King0>King, pp. xiii\u2013xviii</ref> The first four [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4&nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following [[periodic trend]]s, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6&nbsp;pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2&nbsp;pm) and germanium (122.3&nbsp;pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40&nbsp;pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple Si<sup>4+</sup> cation in reality.<ref name=Greenwood372>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 372</ref>\n\n====Electrical====\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny [[semiconductor]] with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap ([[band gap]]) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The [[Fermi level]] is about halfway between the [[valence and conduction bands]] and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] silicon with a [[pnictogen]] such as [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type semiconductor]]. Similarly, doping silicon with a [[boron group|group 13 element]] such as [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]] results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type semiconductor]].<ref name=Greenwood331/> ((<!-- this could be move to electronic applications --> Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a [[p-n junction]] with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [[diode]] that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A [[transistor]] is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a [[triode]] amplifier.<ref name=Greenwood331/>))\n\n====Crystal structure====\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40&nbsp;[[gigapascal]]s known as Si\u2013VII (the standard modification being Si\u2013I). Silicon boils at 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642&nbsp;\u00b0C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si\u2013Si bond is weaker than the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood331/>\n\nIt is also possible to construct [[silicene]] layers analogous to [[graphene]].<ref name=Aufray2010/><ref name=Lalmi2010/>\n\n===Isotopes===\n{{Main|Isotopes of silicon}}\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>28</sup>Si (92.23%), <sup>29</sup>Si (4.67%), and <sup>30</sup>Si (3.10%).{{NUBASE2016|ref}} Out of these, only <sup>29</sup>Si is of use in [[NMR]] and [[EPR spectroscopy]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi|accessdate = 2011-10-20| title = Interactive NMR Frequency Map| author =Jerschow, Alexej|publisher = New York University}}</ref> as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}).<ref name=Greenwood330>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 330\u2013331</ref> All three are produced in stars through the [[oxygen-burning process]], with <sup>28</sup>Si being made as part of the [[alpha process]] and hence the most abundant.

Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, but formation of the [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] dioxide rapidly increases between 950&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1160&nbsp;\u00b0C and when 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C is reached, atmospheric [[nitrogen]] also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Silicon reacts with gaseous [[sulfur]] at 600&nbsp;\u00b0C and gaseous [[phosphorus]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [[halogen]]s; [[fluorine]] attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, [[chlorine]] does so at about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] at about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form [[silicate]]s. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with [[alkyl halide]]s; this reaction may be catalysed by [[copper]] to directly synthesise [[organosilicon]] chlorides as precursors to [[silicone]] polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form [[silicide]]s, and reducing most metal oxides because the [[heat of formation]] of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of [[refractory]], unreactive materials such as [[zirconium dioxide]] or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.<ref name=Greenwood331>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 331\u2013335</ref>\n\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon,<ref name=Kaupp>{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/LecturasobreNodosRadiales_12854.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320\u2013325 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=14 October 2016|bibcode=1984JCoCh...5..500B }}</ref> and thus octahedral coordination is also significant.<ref name=Greenwood331/> For example, the [[electronegativity]] of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward [[catenation]] (formation of Si\u2013Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si\u2013Si bond compared to the C\u2013C bond:<ref name=King43>King, pp. 43\u201344</ref> the average Si\u2013Si bond energy is approximately 226&nbsp;kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356&nbsp;kJ/mol for the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood374>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 374</ref> This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the [[double bond rule]]. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of [[hypervalence]], as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as {{chem|SiX|5|-}} and {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King43/> Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a [[metalloid]] rather than a nonmetal.<ref name=King43/> However, metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.<ref name=Greenwood328/>\n\nSilicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, [[organic chemistry]] has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while [[silicate]] minerals have a structural complexity unseen in [[oxocarbon]]s.<ref name=Greenwood328>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 328\u2013329</ref> Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [[d-block contraction]], resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict.<ref name=Greenwood372/> Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon, which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge\u2013O bond strength compared to the Si\u2013O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\" polymers that would be analogous to [[silicone]] polymers.<ref name=Greenwood374/>\n\n===Silicides===\n{{main|Silicide|Binary compounds of silicon}}\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Fe Si analyse thermique 30.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Phase diagram of the Fe\u2013Si system]]\nMany metal [[silicide]]s are known, most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]: their bonding ranges from [[metallic bond|metallic]] to [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]]. Some known stoichiometries are M<sub>6</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si, M<sub>4</sub>Si, M<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, MSi, M<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, MSi<sub>2</sub>, MSi<sub>3</sub>, and MSi<sub>6</sub>. They are structurally more similar to the [[boride]]s than the [[carbide]]s, in keeping with the [[diagonal relationship]] between [[boron]] and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures.<ref name=Greenwood335>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 335\u2013337</ref> Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1\u201310, with the exception of [[beryllium]]: in particular, [[uranium]] and the transition metals of groups 4\u201310 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [[copper]], the metals in groups 11\u201315 do not form silicides. Instead, most form [[eutectic mixture]]s, although the heaviest [[post-transition metal]]s [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]] are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nUsually, silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For example, the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and most of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides {{chem|(M|+|)|4|(Si|4|4-|)}} contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the {{chem|Si|4|4-}} anion, isoelectronic with [[white phosphorus]], P<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood335/><ref name=King45>King, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e. g. Cu<sub>5</sub>Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e. g. U<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>) or four silicon atoms (e. g. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>4</sub>[Si<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>) at first, followed by chains (e. g. CaSi), layers (e. g. CaSi<sub>2</sub>), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e. g. \u03b1-ThSi<sub>2</sub>) as the silicon content rises even higher.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nThe silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents, except for [[hydrofluoric acid]]; however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid [[potassium hydroxide]], or gaseous fluorine or [[chlorine]] when red-hot. The pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n:Na<sub>2</sub>Si + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n:Mg<sub>2</sub>Si + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> + SiH<sub>4</sub>\nProducts often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl<sub>2</sub> structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [[calcium hydroxide]], hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH<sub>2</sub>, while CaSi<sub>2</sub> with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\n===Silanes===\n{{main|Silanes}}\nSpeculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the 1830s, contemporary with the development of synthetic [[organic chemistry]]. [[Silane]] itself, as well as [[trichlorosilane]], were first synthesised by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] and [[Heinrich Buff]] in 1857 by reacting aluminium\u2013silicon alloys with [[hydrochloric acid]], and characterised as SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiHCl<sub>3</sub> by [[Charles Friedel]] and [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1867. [[Disilane]] (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) followed in 1902, when it was first made by [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Samuel Smiles]] by the [[protonolysis]] of [[magnesium silicide]]s. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [[Alfred Stock]] began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the [[borane|boron hydrides]]. The names ''silanes'' and ''boranes'' are his, based on analogy with the [[alkane]]s.<ref name=Greenwood337/><ref>E. Wiber, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1977/pdf/4906x0691.pdf Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry],\" ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691\u2013700.</ref><ref>J. W. Mellor, \"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry,\" Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223\u2013227.</ref> The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes.<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nThe silanes comprise a [[homologous series]] of silicon hydrides with a general formula of Si<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>. They are all strong [[reducing agent]]s. Unbranched and branched chains are known up to ''n''=8, and the cycles Si<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months).<ref name=Greenwood337/> They decompose to form polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and hydrogen gas.<ref>W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.\", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.</ref><ref>Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844.</ref> As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more so than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si\u2013H bond compared to the C\u2013H bond, and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [[activation energy]].<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nSilane [[pyrolysis]] gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C\u2013H or C\u2013C bond and the formation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating [[silylene]]s :SiH<sub>2</sub> or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210&nbsp;kJ/mol) is much less than the Si\u2013Si and Si\u2013H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in [[methanol]], controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH<sub>2</sub>(OMe)<sub>2</sub>, SiH(OMe)<sub>3</sub>, and Si(OMe)<sub>4</sub>. The Si\u2013H bond also adds to [[alkene]]s, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450&nbsp;\u00b0C, silane participates in an [[addition reaction]] with [[acetone]], as well as a [[ring-opening reaction]] with [[ethylene oxide]]. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate [[hydrogen halide]] with an Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid [[silver]] halide in a heated flow reactor:<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2 AgCl {{overunderset|\u2192|260&nbsp;\u00b0C|&nbsp;}} SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl + 2 Ag\nAmong the derivatives of silane, [[iodosilane]] (SiH<sub>3</sub>I) and [[potassium silanide]] (KSiH<sub>3</sub>) are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing K<sup>+</sup> cations and {{chem|SiH|3|-}} anions in the [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] structure, and is made by the reduction of silane by [[potassium]] metal.<ref name=King47>King, p. 47</ref> Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species {{chem|SiH|5|-}} is also known.<ref name=Greenwood337/> With suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric conductivities, arising from [[sigma bond|sigma]] delocalisation of the electrons in the chain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=R.D. |last2=Michl |first2=J. |doi=10.1021/cr00096a006 |title=Polysilane high polymers |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |volume=89 |issue=6| pages=1359 |year=1989 |pmid= |pmc =}}</ref>\n\n===Halides===\nSilicon and [[silicon carbide]] readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive, and volatile silicon tetrahalides.<ref name=Greenwood340>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 340\u20132</ref> [[Silicon tetrafluoride]] also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on glass.<ref name=King48/> Heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr<sub>3</sub> through SiFClBr<sub>2</sub> to SiFCl<sub>2</sub>Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in [[aluminium fluoride]] to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.<ref name=Greenwood340/> [[Silicon tetrachloride]] is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [[ester]]s.<ref name=Greenwood340/> The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.<ref name=King48>King, p. 48</ref> The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess [[hydrofluoric acid]] produces the octahedral [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|hexafluorosilicate]] anion {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King48/>\n\nAnalogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si<sub>''n''</sub>X<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub> also are known. While catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si<sub>14</sub>F<sub>30</sub>, Si<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>14</sub>, and Si<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [[pi backbonding]] from the filled p<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of [[carbon monoxide]] in [[metal carbonyl complex]]es and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by [[comproportionation]] of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes ([[trimethylammonium]] being a useful catalyst for this reaction).<ref name=Greenwood340/>\n\n===Silica===\n[[Silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), also known as silica, is one of the best-studied compounds, second only to [[properties of water|water]]. Twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being \u03b1-[[quartz]], a major constituent of many rocks such as [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. It also is known to occur in a pure form as [[rock crystal]]; impure forms are known as [[rose quartz]], [[smoky quartz]], [[morion (mineral)|morion]], [[amethyst]], and [[citrine quartz|citrine]]. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[carnelian]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[flint]]. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]], as well as the much less common [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Biologically generated forms are also known as [[kieselguhr]] and [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Vitrification|Vitreous]] silicon dioxide is known as [[tektite]]s, and [[obsidian]], and rarely as [[lechatelierite]]. Some synthetic forms are known as [[keatite]] and [[W-silica]]. [[Opal]]s are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood342>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 342\u2013347</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|Quartz\nFile:Quartz - Agateplate, redbrown-white.jpg|Agate\nFile:Tridymite tabulars - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|Tridymite\nFile:Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg|Cristobalite\nFile:Coesiteimage.jpg|Coesite\n</gallery>\n\nMost crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra (with Si at the center) connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, \u03b1-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si\u2013O distances (159.7 and 161.7&nbsp;pm) with a Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle of 144\u00b0. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual \u03b1-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537&nbsp;\u00b0C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar \u03b2-quartz, with a change of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle to 155\u00b0 but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867&nbsp;\u00b0C results in another reversible phase transition to \u03b2-tridymite, in which some Si\u2013O bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120&nbsp;\u00b0C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to \u03b1-tridymite, similarly to the transition from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz. \u03b2-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic \u03b2-cristobalite at about 1470&nbsp;\u00b0C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200\u2013280&nbsp;\u00b0C to \u03b1-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. \u03b2-cristobalite melts at 1713&nbsp;\u00b0C; the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and [[vitrification]], or the formation of a [[glass]], is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt \u03b2-quartz (1550&nbsp;\u00b0C) or \u03b2-tridymite (1703&nbsp;\u00b0C). Silica boils at approximately 2800&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following [[lightning]] strikes, forming glassy [[lechatelierite]]. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to [[silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) and [[silicon diselenide]] (SiSe<sub>2</sub>): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430 H2SiO3.JPG|thumb|Condensed polysilicic acid]]\nSilica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates, to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and [[metalloid]] oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, [[sodium silicate]] is often used in detergents due to its [[buffer (chemistry)|buffering]], [[saponification|saponifying]], and [[emulsification|emulsifying]] properties.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicic acids===\nAdding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800&nbsp;\u00b0C due to the breaking of the structure by replacing Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages with terminating Si\u2013OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated [[silica gel]]s and [[colloid]]al silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [[silicic acid]]s exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula [SiO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>4\u22122''x''</sub>]<sub>''n''</sub>, similar to the behaviour of [[boron]], [[aluminium]], and [[iron]], among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [[orthosilicic acid]] Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> and [[metasilicic acid]] SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicate minerals===\n{{main|Silicate minerals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" | Typical coordination of metal cations in silicates (ionic radii in [[picometre|pm]])<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n|-\n!

Tetrahedral {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into ''neso''-silicates (discrete {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, ''soro''-silicates (discrete {Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>} units) sharing one, ''cyclo''-silicates (closed ring structures) and ''ino''-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, ''phyllo''-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and ''tecto''-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed, or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.<ref name=Greenwood347>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 347\u2013359</ref>\n\nThe [[orthosilicate]]s M{{su|p=II|b=2}}SiO{{su|b=4}} (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> are ''neso''-silicates. Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> ([[phenacite]]) is unusual as both Be<sup>II</sup> and Si<sup>IV</sup> occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe,Mn)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. [[Zircon]], ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, demands eight-coordination of the Zr<sup>IV</sup> cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84&nbsp;pm). Also significant are the [[garnet]]s, [M{{su|p=II|b=3}}M{{su|p=III|b=2}}(SiO{{su|b=4}}){{su|b=3}}], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for Ca<sup>II</sup>. ''Soro''-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic \"[(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>]<sup>2''n''\u2212</sup>\" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\nChain metasilicates, {SiO{{su|p=2\u2212|b=3}}}{{su|b=\u221e}}, form by corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most [[pyroxene]] minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in the [[asbestos]] minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|A typical zeolite structure]]\nLayer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [[mica]]s, are very common, and often are formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is [[kaolinite]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]; in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral Si<sup>IV</sup> may be replaced by Al<sup>III</sup>, octahedral Al<sup>III</sup> by Mg<sup>II</sup>, and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> by F<sup>\u2212</sup>. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO<sub>2</sub> structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the Si<sup>IV</sup> atoms with Al<sup>III</sup>, they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include [[feldspar]]s (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), [[zeolite]]s, and [[ultramarine]]s. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting Al<sup>III</sup> to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]], which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition, but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks ([[truncated cuboctahedron|truncated cuboctahedra]] being most common, but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{chem|SO|4|2-}}, and {{chem|S|2|2-}}, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n===Other inorganic compounds===\n[[Silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C; sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibers reminiscent of [[asbestos]] with a structure similar to W-silica. This melts at 1090&nbsp;\u00b0C and sublimes at 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C; at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite. However, SiS<sub>2</sub> lacks the variety of structures of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and quickly hydrolyses to silica and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It is also ammonolysed quickly and completely by liquid [[ammonia]] as follows to form an [[imide]]:<ref name=Greenwood359>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 359\u2013361</ref>\n:SiS<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si(NH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>SH\nIt reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal [[thiosilicate]]s: reaction with [[ethanol]] results in [[tetraethylsilicate]] Si(OEt)<sub>4</sub> and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)<sub>3</sub>, cyclic Cl<sub>2</sub>Si(\u03bc-S)<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, and crystalline (SiSCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Despite the [[double bond rule]], stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an [[amine]] group.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[Silicon nitride]], Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. It would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it: chemically, it is near-totally inert, and even above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]]), dissociates only at 1900&nbsp;\u00b0C at 1&nbsp;atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). A similar refractory material is Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450&nbsp;\u00b0C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages to each other.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\nReacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which are silicon analogues of the [[amine]]s:<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n:3 SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl\n:SiH<sub>3</sub>Br + 2 Me<sub>2</sub>NH \u2192 SiH<sub>3</sub>NMe<sub>2</sub> + Me<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>Br\n:4 SiH<sub>3</sub>I + 5 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> \u2192 (SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I\n\nMany such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH\u2013NH group are unstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>is planar, which has been attributed to a p<sub>\u03c0</sub>\u2013d<sub>\u03c0</sub> interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbital on silicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues, the tertiary [[amine]]s, although substitution of some SiH<sub>3</sub> groups by CH<sub>3</sub> groups mitigates this weakness. For example, N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> does not form an [[adduct]] with [[borane|BH<sub>3</sub>]] at all, while MeN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Me<sub>2</sub>NSiH<sub>3</sub> form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon analogues of [[imine]]s, with a Si=N double bond, are known: the first found was Bu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>2</sub>Si=N\u2013SiBu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>3</sub>, which was discovered in 1986.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon carbide]]\n[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) was first made by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between [[diamond]] (an allotrope of carbon) and [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]).

It is resistant to most aqueous acids, [[phosphoric acid]] being an exception. It forms a protective layer of [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl<sub>4</sub> and carbon at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and SiCl<sub>4</sub> and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.<ref name=Greenwood334/> In its diamond-like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Organosilicon compounds===\n{{main|Organosilicon}}\n[[Image:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|A hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si\u2013H is added to an unsaturated substrate]]\nBecause the Si\u2013C bond is close in strength to the C\u2013C bond, organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, [[tetraphenylsilane]] (SiPh<sub>4</sub>) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428&nbsp;\u00b0C, and so may its substituted derivatives Ph<sub>3</sub>SiCl and Ph<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, which boil at 378&nbsp;\u00b0C and 305&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds.<ref name=Greenwood361>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 361\u2013366</ref> However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si\u2013F bond is significantly stronger than even the [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond|C\u2013F bond]] and is one of the strongest single bonds, while the Si\u2013H bond is much weaker than the C\u2013H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] or [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si\u2013C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C\u2013O \u03c3* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called \"S<sub>N</sub>2 at silicon\" for simplicity.<ref name=Clayden668>Clayden, pp. 668\u201377</ref>\n\nOne of the most useful silicon-containing groups is [[trimethylsilyl]], Me<sub>3</sub>Si\u2013. The Si\u2013C bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the [[fluoride]] ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic [[proton]]s; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [[selenium]], or [[iodine]]), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in [[haloalkane]]s, but at the oxygen in [[silyl]] chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [[silyl ether]] [[hexamethyldisiloxane]], (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O. Conversely, while the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (\u03b4+) at the carbon, the analogous \"S<sub>N</sub>2\" reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl [[triflate]]s are so electrophilic that they react 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] is in particular a very good [[Lewis acid]] and is used to convert [[carbonyl]] compounds to [[acetal]]s and [[silyl enol ether]]s, reacting them together analogously to the [[aldol reaction]].<ref name=Clayden668/>\n\nSi\u2013C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with [[organolithium]], [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]], or [[organoaluminium]] reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si\u2013H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [[copper]] as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Silicone polymers===\n{{main|Silicone}}\n[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[polydimethylsiloxane]], the principal component of silicones]]\nThe word \"silicone\" was first used by Frederic Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO and [[benzophenone]], Ph<sub>2</sub>CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO, which is not shared by Ph<sub>2</sub>CO.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\nSilicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the [[isoelectronic]] O<sup>\u2212</sup> of the silicates.<ref name=Greenwood361/> They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally, may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]] oxyhalides, converting a [[tungsten hexachloride]] suspension in [[dichloroethane]] solution quantitatively to WOCl<sub>4</sub> in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg|thumb|upright|Olivine]]\nIn the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[neon]]. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the [[Solar System]]. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by [[planetary differentiation]]: [[Earth's core]], which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe<sub>25</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as [[aluminosilicate]]s rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.<ref name=Greenwood329>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\nThe crystallisation of [[igneous rock]]s from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as [[lattice energy]], melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, [[olivine]] appears first, followed by [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] mica, [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[muscovite mica]], [[quartz]], [[zeolite]]s, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of [[hydroxide]] and [[fluoride]] anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo [[weathering]], transport, and deposition, [[sedimentary rock]]s like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. [[Metamorphism]] also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.<ref name=Greenwood329/>\n\n==Production==\nSilicon of 96\u201399% purity is made by reducing [[quartzite]] or sand with highly pure [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. The reduction is carried out in an [[electric arc furnace]], with an excess of SiO<sub>2</sub> used to stop [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) from accumulating:<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n:2 SiC + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\n\n[[File:Ferrosilicon.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Ferrosilicon alloy]]\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], producing [[ferrosilicon]].<ref name=Greenwood330/> Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million [[tonne]]s (or 2/3 of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/mcs-2011-simet.pdf |publisher=USGS |title=Silicon Commodities Report 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.<ref name=Greenwood330/> Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:<ref name=Ullmann574>Zulehner et al., p. 574</ref>\n:3 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 Al \u2192 3 Si + 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nLeaching powdered 96\u201397% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of [[silicone]] production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated [[fractional distillation]], followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [[zinc]] metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by [[zone refining]]. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]], a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic [[sodium]]: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: [[transistor]] production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 10<sup>10</sup>, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 10<sup>12</sup> are needed and attained.<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n\n==Applications==\n===Compounds===\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.<ref name=Greenwood356>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 356.</ref>\n\nSilica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]], which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.\n\nSilicones often are used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.\n\n=== Alloys ===\nElemental silicon is added to molten [[cast iron]] as [[ferrosilicon]] or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of [[cementite]] where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.<ref name=\"diecasting\">Apelian, D.

In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers.

Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia</ref>\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.<ref name=USGS>Corathers, Lisa A.

The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its [[highest occupied molecular orbital]] (HOMO) slightly higher than a valance band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the [[photocurrent]] emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.<ref>Yue, Zhao, Fred Lisdat, Wolfgang J. Parak, Stephen G.

The wing section was reflexed at the [[trailing edge]].  The wing had a constant chord centre section with taper on the trailing edge outboard and rounded tips. The [[aileron]]s were plywood covered and [[balanced rudder|unbalanced]].<ref name=AB/><ref name=JAWA38/>\n\nIts [[fuselage]] was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, with the straight edged [[fin]] an integral part. The [[rudder]] was rounded and [[balanced rudder|horn balanced]].  Though the rudder was wood framed and covered, the tailplane, mounted just above the fuselage and externally braced from below, had a tube steel structure and was [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covered]]. The [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] were balanced by an [[Bungee cord|elastic rope]] to the [[control column]].<ref name=AB/><ref name=JAWA38/>\n\nEarly in the design process the E.114 had been envisaged as an open cockpit aircraft but by the time of construction there was an enclosed cabin.  The first prototype had rather crude glazing constructed from plane panes. The absence of doors made entry somewhat challenging, with the side panels hinged down and the upper pane, together with part of the wing [[leading edge]] hinged upwards. The second prototype added a lower fuselage foothold to ease the process, as well as fitting less angular glazing.  The [[Landing gear|undercarriage]], which was also used as a first step into the cabin, was of the divided type with [[aircraft fairing|faired]] legs hinged on the lower fuselage, assisted by struts from the centre line to the wheels. The wheels contained rubber shock absorbers and were optionally [[aircraft fairing|spatted]]<ref name=AB/><ref name=JAWA38/>\n\nEarly aircraft were powered by a 29&nbsp;kW (36&nbsp;hp) [[Aeronca E-113]] air-cooled, boxer two-cylinder engine mounted in the extreme nose with its cylinders exposed. Early production aircraft replaced the US-built Aeronca with a very similar Czechoslovakian engine, also built by Praga, called the [[Praga B]].  Later the similar but more powerful [[Praga B2]] was fitted and from 1936 this was replaced in turn by the four-cylinder [[Praga D]] producing 49/55&nbsp;kW (65/74&nbsp;hp), with each pair of exposed cylinders merged into a single housing for lower drag. Aircraft with this engine were referred to as '''E.114D'''.<ref name=AB/>\n\nAs well as benefiting from more power, the E.114D had other enhancements. The ailerons were balanced, improving the stall characteristics; the vertical surfaces were increased in area and given a more angular profile with a non-balanced rudder.<ref name=AB/>\n\nThe last E.114 variant involving an engine change was the E.114M, fitted with a 49&nbsp;kW (65&nbsp;hp) [[Walter Mikron|Walter Mikron III]] four-cylinder inverted inline engine.  The full cowling changed the look of the nose considerably and increased the length by 510&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). The E.114M was the heaviest of the series, with an empty weight of  415&nbsp;kg (915&nbsp;lb); the E.114D weighed 330&nbsp;kg (728&nbsp;lb). The wing carried noticeable [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] and the E.114M was the only one of its type to have a tailwheel rather than a skid. It was the fastest of the type, with a maximum speed of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph).<ref name=AB/>\n\nThe '''E.115''' appeared in 1937 with significant changes to the wing. The span was only slightly reduced (by 200&nbsp;mm or 7.9&nbsp;in) but continuous taper reduced the area by 20%. The ailerons were fabric covered. It could be powered by either the Praga B or D and was noticeably faster than earlier variants, even with the smaller engine. The E.115 also had a revised undercarriage, with single, streamlined steel struts hinged to the lower fuselage braced by  rods to the centre section. The wheels were spatted and the legs sprung with [[bungee cord]] inside the fuselage.<ref name=AB/><ref name=JAWA38/>\n\nThe '''E.117''' of 1937 had major alterations.  The wing was the same span as that of the E.114 but was given a straight taper, resulting in a small (3.3%) decrease in area. For the first time flaps (of the [[Flap (aircraft)#Types|split type]]) were fitted. The wing remained wooden but a steel framed, fabric covered fuselage was used and the fin and elevator were similarly constructed.  The new fuselage construction allowed the E.117 to have cabin doors for the first time, as well as a more generous interior. It had cantilever undercarriage legs, with wheels in fairings and a tailwheel in place of the skid used by most of the E.114s and E.115, though one of the only two E.117s built flew for a time with a tricycle undercarriage, its mainlegs moved rearwards and with a faired nosewheel assembly.<ref name=AB/>\n\nThe '''E.214''', which appeared in about 1936 or 1937 was essentially an E.114 with a 56&nbsp;kW (75&nbsp;hp) [[Pobjoy R]] seven-cylinder [[radial engine]]. The structure was the same as that of the E.114 and the wings had the same dimensions.  With a length of 7.15&nbsp;m (23&nbsp;ft&nbsp;5\u00bd&nbsp;in), the E.214 was a few  millimetres longer than the E.114M, despite the latter's much longer engine and the extension provided space for a second pair of seats behind the first, making the E.214 a four-seater. The new seats were accessed via a side door, though the front pair retained the side window route of the earlier aircraft. A [[trim tab]] on the elevator replaced the elastic rope balance and the undercarriage was also new, each side having an [[oleo strut|oleo]] leg fixed to the lower fuselage [[longeron]] and braced at its lower end  by a V-form strut, hinged on the fuselage centreline.  At 420&nbsp;kg (926&nbsp;lb), its empty weight was close to that of the E.114M.  Maximum speed was 170&nbsp;km/h (106&nbsp;mph).<ref name=JAWA38/>\n\n==Operational history==\nThe first Air Baby prototype flew for the first time in September 1934 and appeared at the Czech National Flying Club Competition. After several demonstration flights within [[Europe]] it was displayed at the 1934 Paris salon.<ref name=AB/>\n\nThe Praga was produced before [[World War II]] both by [[\u010cKD-Praga]] in [[Prague]] and, under licence as the '''Hillson Praga''', by F.

Earlier in January 2020, Yachty had made a cameo appearance in the music video for [[Future (rapper)|Future]] hit single \"[[Life Is Good (song)|Life Is Good]]\", featuring Drake. He was an assistant of Drake being the worker of a off-brand [[Apple Store]] in the video. Although \"Oprah's Bank Account\" is an \"organic\" collaboration, the rapper said he didn't initially plan to have Drake or DaBaby on it. Instead, Yachty originally wanted [[Lizzo]] on the song. However, according to him, Lizzo never responded to him. Drake decided to feature on the song after hearing a snippet of it on Yachty's personal [[Instagram]] account. DaBaby's verse was added a few days after Yachty had made the song and DaBaby expressed interest in being on the song after he heard Yachty play it while they were in the studio together. Lil Yachty said his purpose for the song was \"to be fun and be a vibe\".<ref name=\"Complex\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/03/lil-yachty-interview-oprah-bank-account-drake-dababy|title=Lil Yachty Interview: How Drake and DaBaby Got on \"Oprah's Bank Account\" Instead of Lizzo|last=McKinney|first=Jessica|date=March 9, 2020|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\nThe song was produced by Earl on the Beat, whose production, according to ''[[Stereogum]]''{{'}}s Chris DeVille \"makes phenomenal use of [[arpeggio]]s\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2076193/lil-yachty-dababy-drake-oprahs-bank-account/video/|title=Lil Yachty & DaBaby - Oprah's Bank Account (Feat.
