Playwright Rodolphe (John Gilbert) and his painter roommate Marcel ([[Gino Corrado]]) have trouble with Bernard (Eugene Pouyet), the [[landlord]], who threatens to throw them out if they do not come up with the monthly rent that night. Rodolphe reluctantly starts writing an overdue article for a journal editor to earn some money, but the editor rejects his work. With the help of their friends, musician Schaunard (George Hassell) and bookish Colline ([[Edward Everett Horton]]), they are able to raise the money. \n\nTheir next door neighbor, Mimi (Lillian Gish), an orphaned, friendless [[Embroidery|embroiderer]], has the same problem. Bernard is attracted to her, but when she does not respond to his overture, he issues the same threat. She takes her meager belongings to the municipal [[Pawnbroker|pawnshop]], but does not receive enough money to pay the rent. On her way back, she is nearly run over (deliberately) by the carriage of the rich, idle aristocrat Vicomte Paul ([[Roy D'Arcy]]). She has to fend off his advances. \n\nWhen Marcel is invited to dinner by his girlfriend and downstairs neighbor, Musette ([[Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e]]), he persuades her to allow Schaunard to join them. Then the musician gets her to include Colline, who asks for Rodolphe. Rodolphe misses his cue to join the festivities in order to become acquainted with Mimi. Seeing how cold she is, he invites her to warm herself in his apartment. Later, after she vacates her room, Rodolphe entices her to share in the food Musette has provided. Then Vicomte Paul comes over. She thinks he wants some embroidery done, not realizing he has baser motives. Rodolphe does and immediately becomes jealous of the aristocrat. In any case, Mimi is able to pay her rent and stay.\n\nIn spring, Mimi joins her friends out in the country for her very first picnic. She and the love-smitten Rodolphe wander away. After a while, she admits that she loves him. This inspires Rodolphe to write a play. When Mimi takes his latest, long overdue article to his editor, she is requested to tell him that he is discharged. Wanting Rodolphe to continue working undisturbed on his play, she works secretly at night to keep up the deception that he still has a paying job. The strain, however, makes her sick. \n\nWhen Vicomte Paul comes to pick up Mimi's handiwork, she tells him of Rodolphe's new play. Still hoping to seduce her, he offers to show it to a theatrical manager, if she will come with him to the theatre. Rodolphe sees them together and, in a rage, accuses Mimi of having an affair. She tries to explain, but he refuses to listen.\n\nRodolphe tries to forget Mimi. When he runs into the editor, he is surprised to hear he was fired five weeks ago. Meanwhile, Mimi, with Musette's help, dresses up and goes with Vicomte Paul to the theatre, hoping to get Rodolphe's play accepted. She once again rejects the vicomte's advances. Returning home, she is confronted by Rodolphe. She admits having worked in secret for him. He initially forgives her, until he finds out that she went out with Vicomte Paul and jumps to the conclusion she got the money from him. He hits her, but soon apologizes when he discovers she is very sick.\n\nRodolphe goes to find a doctor, but she leaves before they return, explaining in a letter that she will come back when his play is a success. He searches for her for months. Out of his anguish, a new and greater play is born. This turns out to be a hit, but he is miserable without Mimi. Meanwhile, Mimi is toiling in the [[slum]]s of Paris, but the hard work is too much for the frail woman. She collapses. The doctor tells her coworkers she will not live out the night. She stumbles out into the street and eventually reaches her old apartment. Rodolphe is ecstatic to see her. Their friends, however, realize her condition. While he goes to fetch her pet bird, she tells Musette she is happy, before dying.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lillian Gish]] as Mimi Brodeuse\n* [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as Rodolphe\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e]] as Musette\n* [[George Hassell (actor)|George Hassell]] as Schaunard\n* [[Roy D'Arcy]] as Vicomte Paul\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Colline\n* [[Karl Dane]] as Benoit (Janitor) <!-- exactly as listed in the onscreen credits !-->\n* [[Mathilde Comont]] as Madame Benoit\n* [[Gino Corrado]] as Marcel\n* Eugene Pouyet as Bernard (as Gene Pouyet)\n* [[Frank Currier]] as Theatre Manager\n* David Mir as Alexis\n* Catherine Vidor as Louise\n* [[Valentina Zimina]] as Phemie\n* [[Harry Crocker]] as Bit Part (uncredited)\n* [[Blanche Payson]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n[[Lillian Gish]] had just returned from a visit to [[Europe]] and wanted to especially reach out to her European fans.

He was famous for his [[waltz]]es, and he popularized them alongside [[Joseph Lanner]], thereby setting the foundations for his sons to carry on his musical dynasty. He is perhaps best known for his composition of the [[Radetzky March]] (named after [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]]).\n\n==Life and work==\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Radetzky March.ogg\n|title=Radetzky March\n|description=Strauss' most famous work, \"[[Radetzky March]]\", arranged for the [[United States Marine Band]]}}\nStrauss was born in [[Leopoldstadt]] (now in [[Vienna]]). Strauss's parents, Franz Borgias Strauss (October 10, 1764 \u2013 April 5, 1816) and Barbara Dollmann (December 3, 1770 \u2013 August 28, 1811), were innkeepers ({{Lang|de|Zum heiligen Florian}}). He was born a [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nHis mother died of 'creeping fever' when he was seven and five years later his father drowned, possibly as a result of suicide, in the [[Danube]] river. Strauss' guardian, the tailor Anton M\u00fcller, placed him as an apprentice to the [[bookbinding|bookbinder]], Johann Lichtscheidl; Strauss took lessons in the violin and [[viola]] in addition to fulfilling his apprenticeship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johann-strauss.org.uk/composers/index.php3?content=johann1 |title=Johann Strauss Society: Johann Strauss I |accessdate=19 October 2008 |publisher=Johann Strauss Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231162325/http://www.johann-strauss.org.uk/composers/index.php3?content=johann1 |archive-date=31 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Martin Bjelik: [http://www.johann-strauss.at/biographie/biographie.shtml \"Biographien von Johann Strau\u00df Vater und Sohn\"], Wiener Institut f\u00fcr Strauss-Forschung {{in lang|de}}</ref><ref>Norbert Rubey: [http://bibliothek.univie.ac.at/ausstellungen/002337.html Johann Strauss (Vater) \u2014 \"ein Musiker von Gottes Gnaden\"?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706085703/http://bibliothek.univie.ac.at/ausstellungen/002337.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, [[University of Vienna]] {{in lang|de}}</ref> Contrary to a story later told by his son Johann II, Strauss successfully completed his bookbinder appreciation in 1822. He also studied music with Johann Polischansky during his apprenticeship and eventually managed to secure a place in a local orchestra, headed by Michael Pamer. Strauss left the orchestra to join a popular string quartet known as the ''Lanner Quartet'', formed by his would-be rivals Joseph Lanner and the Drahanek brothers, Karl and Johann. This string quartet playing [[Viennese Waltz]]es and rustic German dances expanded into a small string orchestra in 1824.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nStrauss became deputy [[Conducting|conductor]] of the orchestra to assist Lanner in commissions after it became so popular during the [[Carnival|Fasching]] of 1824 and Strauss was soon placed in command of a second smaller orchestra which was formed as a result of the success of the parent orchestra. In 1825, he decided to form his own band and began to write music (chiefly, dance music) for it to play after he realized that he could also possibly emulate the success of Lanner in addition to putting an end to his financial struggles. By so doing, he would have made Lanner a serious rival although the rivalry did not entail hostile consequences as the musical competition was very productive for the development of the waltz as well as other dance music in Vienna.\n\nHe soon became one of the best-known and well loved dance composers in Vienna. During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the {{lang|de|Schwan}} in the suburb of [[Ro\u00dfau]] where his [[T\u00e4uberln-Walzer]] (Op. 1) at once established his reputation.<ref name=eb9>{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Strauss, Johann|volume=22}}</ref> He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901.\n\nOn a trip to France in 1837 he heard the [[quadrille]] and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss' popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' [[overture]] into his early waltz, \"[[Wiener Carneval]]\", Op. 3, and also the French [[national anthem]] \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" into his \"Paris-Walzer\", Op. 101.\n\n[[File:Johann Strauss I (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Strauss I, 1837]]\nStrauss married Maria Anna Streim in 1825 in the Roman Catholic [[Lichtental Parish Church]] in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy due to his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had seven children; [[Johann Strauss II|Johann]], [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Eduard Strauss]], the last of whom had a son called [[Johann Strauss III]]. Strauss Sr. also had two daughters, Anna, who was born in 1829, and Therese, who was born in 1831. His third son, Ferdinand, born in 1834, lived only ten months.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe family home was called 'Hirschenhaus' but was better known in Vienna as the 'Goldener Hirsch' (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother [[Josef Strauss]] was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest [[Eduard Strauss]] was expected to join the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] [[Consul (representative)|consulate]].\n\nBy 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eight<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]]: [http://www.members.aon.at/michaelorenz/strauss/ \"Familie Trampusch \u2013 geliebt und totgeschwiegen\"], ''Jahrbuch des Vereins f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien'', Vol. 62/63, 2006/2007, (Vienna: Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, 2011), 135\u201349.</ref> children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II's musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer.\n\nDespite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the [[Viennese Waltz]]. They were written in three-quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son's, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles \u2014 with the view to boost sales of their sheet music \u2014 which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons.\n\n[[File:ZentralfriedhofStraussJohannVater.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Johann Strauss I, [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, Austria]]\nJohann Strauss II often played his father's works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it.

He was famous for his [[waltz]]es, and he popularized them alongside [[Joseph Lanner]], thereby setting the foundations for his sons to carry on his musical dynasty. He is perhaps best known for his composition of the [[Radetzky March]] (named after [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]]).\n\n==Life and work==\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Radetzky March.ogg\n|title=Radetzky March\n|description=Strauss' most famous work, \"[[Radetzky March]]\", arranged for the [[United States Marine Band]]}}\nStrauss was born in [[Leopoldstadt]] (now in [[Vienna]]).

He was born a [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nHis mother died of 'creeping fever' when he was seven and five years later his father drowned, possibly as a result of suicide, in the [[Danube]] river.

He also studied music with Johann Polischansky during his apprenticeship and eventually managed to secure a place in a local orchestra, headed by Michael Pamer. Strauss left the orchestra to join a popular string quartet known as the ''Lanner Quartet'', formed by his would-be rivals Joseph Lanner and the Drahanek brothers, Karl and Johann. This string quartet playing [[Viennese Waltz]]es and rustic German dances expanded into a small string orchestra in 1824.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nStrauss became deputy [[Conducting|conductor]] of the orchestra to assist Lanner in commissions after it became so popular during the [[Carnival|Fasching]] of 1824 and Strauss was soon placed in command of a second smaller orchestra which was formed as a result of the success of the parent orchestra. In 1825, he decided to form his own band and began to write music (chiefly, dance music) for it to play after he realized that he could also possibly emulate the success of Lanner in addition to putting an end to his financial struggles. By so doing, he would have made Lanner a serious rival although the rivalry did not entail hostile consequences as the musical competition was very productive for the development of the waltz as well as other dance music in Vienna.\n\nHe soon became one of the best-known and well loved dance composers in Vienna. During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the {{lang|de|Schwan}} in the suburb of [[Ro\u00dfau]] where his [[T\u00e4uberln-Walzer]] (Op. 1) at once established his reputation.<ref name=eb9>{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Strauss, Johann|volume=22}}</ref> He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901.\n\nOn a trip to France in 1837 he heard the [[quadrille]] and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss' popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' [[overture]] into his early waltz, \"[[Wiener Carneval]]\", Op. 3, and also the French [[national anthem]] \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" into his \"Paris-Walzer\", Op. 101.\n\n[[File:Johann Strauss I (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Strauss I, 1837]]\nStrauss married Maria Anna Streim in 1825 in the Roman Catholic [[Lichtental Parish Church]] in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy due to his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had seven children; [[Johann Strauss II|Johann]], [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Eduard Strauss]], the last of whom had a son called [[Johann Strauss III]]. Strauss Sr. also had two daughters, Anna, who was born in 1829, and Therese, who was born in 1831. His third son, Ferdinand, born in 1834, lived only ten months.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe family home was called 'Hirschenhaus' but was better known in Vienna as the 'Goldener Hirsch' (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother [[Josef Strauss]] was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest [[Eduard Strauss]] was expected to join the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] [[Consul (representative)|consulate]].\n\nBy 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eight<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]]: [http://www.members.aon.at/michaelorenz/strauss/ \"Familie Trampusch \u2013 geliebt und totgeschwiegen\"], ''Jahrbuch des Vereins f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien'', Vol. 62/63, 2006/2007, (Vienna: Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, 2011), 135\u201349.</ref> children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II's musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer.\n\nDespite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the [[Viennese Waltz]]. They were written in three-quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son's, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles \u2014 with the view to boost sales of their sheet music \u2014 which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons.\n\n[[File:ZentralfriedhofStraussJohannVater.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Johann Strauss I, [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, Austria]]\nJohann Strauss II often played his father's works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it. Johann Strauss I himself refused to play ever again at the Dommayer's Casino, which offered his son his conducting debut, and was to tower over his son during his lifetime in terms of career advancement, although Strauss II was to eclipse him in terms of popularity in the classical repertoire.

This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe 1992 stock's design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The new [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 stock]] trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the [[Victoria line]], are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]]/[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996]] stock.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Waterloo & City line sets ===\n[[File:Bank station Waterloo & City line train.JPG|thumb|Waterloo & City line train at Bank]]\nAfter the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for [[British Rail]] for the [[Waterloo & City line]], which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until mid-2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Change for District and Circle lines.\"\n\nSince mid-2003, voice artist [[Emma Clarke]] has provided recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA, which were again revised in 2006. Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.

Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. Change here for the Circle and District lines.\"\n\nIn January 2018, the announcements were again revised for certain stations, to include new lines and connections (such as London Overground, [[TfL Rail]] and the construction of {{LUL stations|station=Wood Lane}} station) that did not exist in 2003. The new announcements are no longer voiced by Emma Clarke.\n\n==Chancery Lane derailment==\nOn 25 January 2003 a 1992 Stock train with approximately 500 people on board train derailed as it entered [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane station]] on the westbound line. The collision resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final report |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |publisher=RAIB |accessdate=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124951/https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost [[traction motor]] on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure.

This included fitting new traction-motor bolts and secondary brackets in to prevent a loose motor from striking the track and causing further damage. The lines re-opened in stages from 14 March 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703040611/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Refurbishment ==\n=== Central line units ===\nThe 1992 Stock has had a refresh of both the interior and exterior. Some of the noticeable changes include a new seat moquette, improved lighting and improvements to the window frames. The front of the driving cabs are also being renewed. This includes repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the red panelling instead of the original grey. The refresh comes after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\n=== Waterloo & City line units ===\n[[File:65507 at Bank LUL station.jpg|thumb|A Waterloo & City line 1992 Stock in its original Network SouthEast livery.

During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from [[Waterloo Underground Depot|Waterloo depot]] and taken by road to [[Wabtec Rail]] in [[Doncaster]] for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground's corporate livery.

This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe 1992 stock's design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The new [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 stock]] trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the [[Victoria line]], are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]]/[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996]] stock.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Waterloo & City line sets ===\n[[File:Bank station Waterloo & City line train.JPG|thumb|Waterloo & City line train at Bank]]\nAfter the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for [[British Rail]] for the [[Waterloo & City line]], which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until mid-2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

They are mainly [[predation|predatory]] flies like most of their relatives in the [[Empidoidea]], and exhibit a wide range of forms but are generally small to medium-sized, non-metallic and rather bristly.\n\nCommon names for members of this family are '''dagger flies''' (referring to the sharp piercing mouthparts of some species) and '''balloon flies'''. The term \"dance flies\" is sometimes used for this family too,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sj\u00f6berg |first1=Fredrik |title=The Fly Trap|date=2014 |publisher=Particular Books |isbn=978-1-846-14776-0 |page=197}}</ref> but the dance flies proper, formerly included herein, are now considered a separate family [[Hybotidae]].\n\n==Description==\nFor terms see [[Morphology of Diptera]].\n\nEmpididae are small to medium-sized flies, rarely large (1.0 to 15.0mm.). The body is slender, or elongated and rarely\nthickset. The colour ranges from yellow to black, and they may be pollinose or lustrous, but never have a metallic gloss. The head is often small and rounded with relatively large eyes. The eyes of the male and (rarely) the female may be contiguous (holoptic). The antenna usually have three segments of which the third is the largest and bears a long or short, usually apical arista or style. The eyes often have an incision (notch) at the level of the antennae. The proboscis is often long and in several genera powerful and piercing. If the mouthparts are strongly elongate they project forward or downward toward the fore legs. Some species have short mouthparts. The legs are usually long and slender but often powerful and in some cases the fore legs are raptorial, adapted to catching and holding prey. The wings are clear or partially tinged and, in some species, with a stigma spot, or with a distinct pattern. Radial vein R<sub>4+5</sub> is often forked and the discal-medial cell (dm) is almost always present. The costa ends at or just beyond R<sub>4+5</sub>, or continues along the wing margin, and can be used as a characteristic to distinguish it from other families.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wahlberg|first=Emma|last2=Johanson|first2=Kjell Arne|date=2018|title=Molecular phylogenetics reveals novel relationships within Empidoidea (Diptera)|journal=Systematic Entomology|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=619\u2013636|doi=10.1111/syen.12297|issn=1365-3113|doi-access=free}}</ref> The venation of the wings in minute species is often simplified. The posteror part of the wings on the basal side of the anal vein bears the designation of axillary or anal lobe. In species with a highly developed axillary lobe, the margin may form an angle with the margin of the alula. This is termed the axillary angle, the size of which is often a good diagnostic feature. It can be distinguished from [[Dolichopodidae]] and [[Hybotidae]] by the presence of unrotated and symmetrical terminalia. The point of origin of R<sub>s</sub> (radial sector) is at a distance from the humeral [[Insect wing|crossvein]] (h) equal to or longer than the length of h. Except for a few species, Empididae is easily distinguishable from the families [[Ragadidae]] and [[Atelestidae]] by having a prosternum that is fused with the proepisternum, which forms a precoxal bridge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe larvae have an incomplete head capsule (hemicephalic) which is often retracted into the thorax 8-segmented abdomen with paired parapods on abdominal segments 1 - 7 or 1 - 8. The posterior spiracles are quite widely separated and the \nanal segment is frequently lobed. The pupae is without a puparium.\n[[Image:Empid flies Empididae mating 01.jpg|thumb|left|Mating Empididae: Female consuming male's mating gift of wasp]]\n\n==Biology==\nAdult empidids are found in a variety of forest habitats, on the leaves of plants, on tree trunks, aquatic vegetation and also in stream beds and seepage habitats. Some species are associated with open areas such as grasslands, agricultural fields, marshes, coastal zones and beaches. Adults capture arthropod prey, including other [[Diptera]] (including other empidids), [[Hemiptera]], [[Homoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], [[Trichoptera]], [[Thysanoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Neuroptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Ephemeroptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Collembola]], and [[Acari]]. Because of their predation they are important natural and [[biological control]] agents of various pest insect species and as a group with a vast [[Species richness|species diversity]] they occupy a wide range of habitats.Some adult Empididae also visit flowers to obtain nectar. At least a few groups (''Iteaphila'', ''Anthepiscopus'', ''Anthalia'', ''Allanthalia''  and ''Euthyneura'') obtain all their protein needs by feeding on pollen. Larvae are generally found in moist soil, rotten wood, dung, or in aquatic habitats and also appear to be predaceous on various arthropods, particularly other Diptera larvae.\n\nSome Empididae, such as the [[Europe]]an species ''[[Hilara maura]]'', have an elaborate [[mating|courtship]] ritual in which the male wraps a prey item in [[silk]] and presents it to the female to stimulate copulation. It was first noticed that these flies carried \"nuptial gifts\" of silk by [[Carl Robert Osten-Sacken|Baron Karl von Osten-Sacken]]. Empididae show diverse mating systems, ranging from species in which males aggregate in mating swarms, and compete for choosing females to sex-role reversed species in which females do aggregate and compete for the attention of choosing males. In some species, such as the [[North America]]n species ''[[Rhamphomyia longicauda|Rhamphomyia longicuada]]'', competition for the food provided by males is so strong that females have developed elaborate ornaments, including feathery \"pennate\" scales on their legs, darkened wings, and inflatable abdominal sacs that enhance their attractiveness.\n\n==Evolution and systematics==\nEmpididae are well represented in [[amber]] deposits and the family certainly seems to have been well established by the [[Cretaceous]] period at the latest.\n\nTwo groups formerly placed here as [[subfamilies]] are now generally regarded as separate families in the [[Empidoidea]]: [[Atelestidae]] and [[Hybotidae]]. The [[Brachystomatidae]] are also sometimes separated as a distinct family, but this seems to be in error. The [[Microphorinae]] were long placed in the Empididae as a subfamily, then briefly classified as a distinct family, and are now considered a subfamily of the [[long-legged flies]] (Dolichopodidae).<ref name=\"Sinclair2006\">{{cite journal| last = Sinclair| first = Bradley J.|author2=Cumming, J.M. | year = 2006| title = The morphology, higher-level phylogeny and classification of the Empidoidea (Diptera)| journal = [[Zootaxa]]| volume = 1180| pages = 1\u2013172| publisher = Magnolia Press| location = New Zealand| issn = 1175-5334| format = PDF| url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/nadsfly/Doid/Doidclass/SinclairCumming2006.pdf| accessdate = 2009-06-04}}</ref><ref name=\"Moulton & Wiegmann 2007\">Moulton & Wiegmann (2007)</ref>\n[[File:Dolichocephala irrorata in copula - 2012-08-15.ogv|thumb|''Dolichocephala irrorata'' ([[Clinocerinae]]) in copula|alt=]]\nAmong the subfamilies currently placed herein, not all are confirmed to be [[monophyletic]] groups.

They are mainly [[predation|predatory]] flies like most of their relatives in the [[Empidoidea]], and exhibit a wide range of forms but are generally small to medium-sized, non-metallic and rather bristly.\n\nCommon names for members of this family are '''dagger flies''' (referring to the sharp piercing mouthparts of some species) and '''balloon flies'''. The term \"dance flies\" is sometimes used for this family too,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sj\u00f6berg |first1=Fredrik |title=The Fly Trap|date=2014 |publisher=Particular Books |isbn=978-1-846-14776-0 |page=197}}</ref> but the dance flies proper, formerly included herein, are now considered a separate family [[Hybotidae]].\n\n==Description==\nFor terms see [[Morphology of Diptera]].\n\nEmpididae are small to medium-sized flies, rarely large (1.0 to 15.0mm.). The body is slender, or elongated and rarely\nthickset. The colour ranges from yellow to black, and they may be pollinose or lustrous, but never have a metallic gloss. The head is often small and rounded with relatively large eyes. The eyes of the male and (rarely) the female may be contiguous (holoptic). The antenna usually have three segments of which the third is the largest and bears a long or short, usually apical arista or style. The eyes often have an incision (notch) at the level of the antennae. The proboscis is often long and in several genera powerful and piercing. If the mouthparts are strongly elongate they project forward or downward toward the fore legs. Some species have short mouthparts. The legs are usually long and slender but often powerful and in some cases the fore legs are raptorial, adapted to catching and holding prey. The wings are clear or partially tinged and, in some species, with a stigma spot, or with a distinct pattern. Radial vein R<sub>4+5</sub> is often forked and the discal-medial cell (dm) is almost always present. The costa ends at or just beyond R<sub>4+5</sub>, or continues along the wing margin, and can be used as a characteristic to distinguish it from other families.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wahlberg|first=Emma|last2=Johanson|first2=Kjell Arne|date=2018|title=Molecular phylogenetics reveals novel relationships within Empidoidea (Diptera)|journal=Systematic Entomology|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=619\u2013636|doi=10.1111/syen.12297|issn=1365-3113|doi-access=free}}</ref> The venation of the wings in minute species is often simplified. The posteror part of the wings on the basal side of the anal vein bears the designation of axillary or anal lobe. In species with a highly developed axillary lobe, the margin may form an angle with the margin of the alula. This is termed the axillary angle, the size of which is often a good diagnostic feature. It can be distinguished from [[Dolichopodidae]] and [[Hybotidae]] by the presence of unrotated and symmetrical terminalia. The point of origin of R<sub>s</sub> (radial sector) is at a distance from the humeral [[Insect wing|crossvein]] (h) equal to or longer than the length of h. Except for a few species, Empididae is easily distinguishable from the families [[Ragadidae]] and [[Atelestidae]] by having a prosternum that is fused with the proepisternum, which forms a precoxal bridge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe larvae have an incomplete head capsule (hemicephalic) which is often retracted into the thorax 8-segmented abdomen with paired parapods on abdominal segments 1 - 7 or 1 - 8. The posterior spiracles are quite widely separated and the \nanal segment is frequently lobed. The pupae is without a puparium.\n[[Image:Empid flies Empididae mating 01.jpg|thumb|left|Mating Empididae: Female consuming male's mating gift of wasp]]\n\n==Biology==\nAdult empidids are found in a variety of forest habitats, on the leaves of plants, on tree trunks, aquatic vegetation and also in stream beds and seepage habitats. Some species are associated with open areas such as grasslands, agricultural fields, marshes, coastal zones and beaches. Adults capture arthropod prey, including other [[Diptera]] (including other empidids), [[Hemiptera]], [[Homoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], [[Trichoptera]], [[Thysanoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Neuroptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Ephemeroptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Collembola]], and [[Acari]]. Because of their predation they are important natural and [[biological control]] agents of various pest insect species and as a group with a vast [[Species richness|species diversity]] they occupy a wide range of habitats.Some adult Empididae also visit flowers to obtain nectar. At least a few groups (''Iteaphila'', ''Anthepiscopus'', ''Anthalia'', ''Allanthalia''  and ''Euthyneura'') obtain all their protein needs by feeding on pollen. Larvae are generally found in moist soil, rotten wood, dung, or in aquatic habitats and also appear to be predaceous on various arthropods, particularly other Diptera larvae.\n\nSome Empididae, such as the [[Europe]]an species ''[[Hilara maura]]'', have an elaborate [[mating|courtship]] ritual in which the male wraps a prey item in [[silk]] and presents it to the female to stimulate copulation. It was first noticed that these flies carried \"nuptial gifts\" of silk by [[Carl Robert Osten-Sacken|Baron Karl von Osten-Sacken]]. Empididae show diverse mating systems, ranging from species in which males aggregate in mating swarms, and compete for choosing females to sex-role reversed species in which females do aggregate and compete for the attention of choosing males. In some species, such as the [[North America|North American]] species ''[[Rhamphomyia longicauda|Rhamphomyia longicuada]]'', competition for the food provided by males is so strong that females have developed elaborate ornaments, including feathery \"pennate\" scales on their legs, darkened wings, and inflatable abdominal sacs that enhance their attractiveness.\n\n==Evolution and systematics==\nEmpididae are well represented in [[amber]] deposits and the family certainly seems to have been well established by the [[Cretaceous]] period at the latest.\n\nTwo groups formerly placed here as [[subfamilies]] are now generally regarded as separate families in the [[Empidoidea]]: [[Atelestidae]] and [[Hybotidae]]. The [[Brachystomatidae]] are also sometimes separated as a distinct family, but this seems to be in error. The [[Microphorinae]] were long placed in the Empididae as a subfamily, then briefly classified as a distinct family, and are now considered a subfamily of the [[long-legged flies]] (Dolichopodidae).<ref name=\"Sinclair2006\">{{cite journal| last = Sinclair| first = Bradley J.|author2=Cumming, J.M. | year = 2006| title = The morphology, higher-level phylogeny and classification of the Empidoidea (Diptera)| journal = [[Zootaxa]]| volume = 1180| pages = 1\u2013172| publisher = Magnolia Press| location = New Zealand| issn = 1175-5334| format = PDF| url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/nadsfly/Doid/Doidclass/SinclairCumming2006.pdf| accessdate = 2009-06-04}}</ref><ref>Moulton & Wiegmann (2007)</ref>\n[[File:Dolichocephala irrorata in copula - 2012-08-15.ogv|thumb|''Dolichocephala irrorata'' ([[Clinocerinae]]) in copula|alt=]]\nAmong the subfamilies currently placed herein, not all are confirmed to be [[monophyletic]] groups.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby. Students enrolled in these two schools receive the same American Section education as their peers on the Lyc\u00e9e International campus.\n\n*[https://www.britishsection.fr British Section] Est. 1968, approx. 850 students\n*[https://www.sectionchinoise.fr Chinese Section] Est. 2008, approx. 130 students\n*[http://www.sectiondanoise.dk Danish Section] Est. 1952, approx. 60 student\n*[https://www.sectionnl.fr Dutch Section] Est. 1952, approx. 600 students\n*[http://deutsche-abteilung.de German Section] Est. 1954, approx. 200 students\n*[http://www.sectionitalienne.org Italian Section] Est. 1968, approx. 300 students\n*[https://www.li-sectionjaponaise.org Japanese Section] Est. 1993, approx. 200 students\n** The Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) lists that program in its group of European ''[[hoshuko]]'' (part-time Japanese educational programmes).<ref name=MEXTEuropeHoshuko>\"[http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/004.htm \u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821\u4e00\u89a7\uff08\u5e73\u621025\u5e744\u670815\u65e5\u73fe\u5728\uff09]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6PT4aGXC8?url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/004.htm Archive]).

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

Shush is identified as Shushan, mentioned in the [[Book of Esther]] and other Biblical books.\n\n== Name ==\n\nIn [[Elamite language|Elamite]], the name of the city was written variously ''\u015cu\u015dan'', ''\u015cu\u015dun'', etc. The origin of the word ''Susa'' is from the local city deity ''[[Inshushinak]]''.\n\n== Literary references ==\n\n[[File:Elam Map-en.svg|300px|thumb|left|Map showing the area of the Elamite kingdom (in orange) and the neighboring areas.

In [[Historiography|historic literature]], Susa appears in the very earliest Sumerian records: for example, it is described as one of the places obedient to [[Inanna]], patron deity of [[Uruk]], in ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''.\n\n=== Biblical texts ===\n\nSusa is also mentioned in the [[Ketuvim]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the name Shushan, mainly in [[Book of Esther|Esther]], but also once each in [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. According to these texts, Nehemiah also lived in Susa during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th century BCE (Daniel mentions it in a prophetic vision), while [[Esther]] became queen there, married to [[Ahasuerus|King Ahasuerus]], and saved the Jews from genocide. A tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area, known as ''Shush-Daniel''. However, a large portion of the current structure is actually a much later construction dated to the late nineteenth century, ca. 1871.<ref>Kriwaczek, Paul. ''Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization'', St. Martin's Press, 2010, p. 5</ref> Susa is further mentioned in the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'' (8:21 & 9:2) as one of the places within the inheritance of [[Shem]] and his eldest son Elam; and in 8:1, \"Susan\" is also named as the son (or daughter, in some translations) of Elam.\n\n== Excavation history ==\n\n[[File:Susa map.jpg|thumb|Site of Susa]]\n[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2344.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria.

Based on C14 dating, the foundation of a settlement there occurred as early as 4395&nbsp;BCE (a calibrated radio-carbon date).<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 46.</ref> At this stage it was already very large for the time,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} about 15 hectares.\n\nThe founding of Susa corresponded with the abandonment of nearby villages. Potts suggests that the settlement may have been founded to try to reestablish the previously destroyed settlement at [[Chogha Mish]].<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\">Potts: ''Elam''.</ref> Previously, Chogha Mish was also a very large settlement, and it featured a similar massive platform that was later built at Susa.\n\nAnother important settlement in the area is [[Chogha Bonut]], that was discovered in 1976.\n\n=== Susa I period ===\n\nShortly after Susa was first settled over 6000&nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape.<ref>[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/saoc63.pdf] Hole, Frank. \"A Monumental Failure: The Collapse of Susa\".

Two settlements named by archaeologists ''Acropolis'' (7 ha) and ''Apadana'' (6.3 ha), would later merge to form Susa proper (18 ha).<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\"/> The ''Apadana'' was enclosed by 6m thick walls of [[rammed earth]] (this particular place is named [[Apadana]] because it also contains a late [[Achaemenid]] structure of this type).\n\n[[File:Iran \u00e9poque d'Obeid S\u00e8vres.jpg|thumb|320px|Goblet and cup, Iran, Susa I style, 4th millennium BC \u2013 [[Ubaid period]]; goblet height c. 12&nbsp;cm; [[S\u00e8vres \u2013 Cit\u00e9 de la c\u00e9ramique]], France]]\n\nNearly two thousand pots of ''Susa I'' style were recovered from the cemetery, most of them now in the [[Louvre]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\">{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}</ref>\nPainted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium BC.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\"/> Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types\u2014a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar\u2014implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}</ref> The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.\n\nCopper metallurgy is also attested during this period, which was contemporary with metalwork at some highland Iranian sites such as [[Tepe Sialk]].\n\n=== Susa II and Uruk influence ===\n\n[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|Globular envelope with the accounting tokens. Clay, Uruk period (c. 3500 BCE). From the Tell of the Acropolis in Susa. [[The Louvre]]]]\n\nSusa came within the Uruk cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture is found at Susa. According to some scholars, Susa may have been a colony of Uruk.\n\nThere is some dispute about the comparative [[periodization]] of Susa and Uruk at this time, as well as about the extent of Uruk influence in Susa. Recent research indicates that Early Uruk period corresponds to Susa II period.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} p58</ref>\n\nD. T. Potts, argue that the influence from the highland Iranian [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]] area in Susa was more significant at the early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the [[alluvial plains]]. Also, Potts stresses the fact that the writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa's needs. Despite the fact that Uruk was far larger than Susa at the time, Susa was not its colony, but still maintained some independence for a long time, according to Potts.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} pp 58\u201361</ref> An architectural link has also been suggested between Susa, Tal-i Malyan, and [[Godin Tepe]] at this time, in support of the idea of the parallel development of the protocuneiform and protoelamite scripts.<ref>F. Desset, An Architectural Pattern in Late Fourth-Millennium BC Western Iran: A New Link Between Susa, Tal-I Malyan, and Godin Tepe, Iran, vol. 52, iss. 1, pp. 1\u201318, 2014</ref>\n\nSome scholars believe that Susa was part of the greater Uruk culture. Holly Pittman, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says,  \"they [Susanians] are participating entirely in an Uruk way of life.  They are not culturally distinct; the material culture of Susa is a regional variation of that on the Mesopotamian plain\". Gilbert Stein, director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, says that \"An expansion once thought to have lasted less than 200 years now apparently went on for 700 years. It is hard to think of any colonial system lasting that long. The spread of Uruk material is not evidence of Uruk domination; it could be local choice\".<ref>Lawler, Andrew.  2003.

Also, he was the last from the [[Awan dynasty]] according to the Susa kinglist.<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 122.</ref> He unified the neighbouring territories and became the king of [[Elam]]. He encouraged the use of the [[Linear Elamite]] script, that remains undeciphered.\n\nThe city was subsequently conquered by the neo-Sumerian [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] and held until Ur finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites under Kindattu in ca. 2004&nbsp;BCE. At this time, Susa became an Elamite capital under the Epartid dynasty.\n\n==== Middle Elamite period ====\nAround 1500 BCE, the Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties. Their rule was characterized by an \"Elamisation\" of Susa, and the kings took the title \"king of Anshan and Susa\". While, previously, the Akkadian language was frequently used in inscriptions, the succeeding kings, such as the Igihalkid dynasty of c. 1400&nbsp;BCE, tried to use Elamite. Thus, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.<ref name=\"The history of Elam\"/>\n\nThis was also the period when the Elamite pantheon was being imposed in Susiana. This policy reached its height with the construction of the political and religious complex at [[Chogha Zanbil]], {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of Susa.\n\nIn ca. 1175&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] plundered the original [[stele]] bearing the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' and took it to Susa. Archeologists found it in 1901.

Archaeologically a stucco panel with the image of a Christian saint has been found.\n\nDuring the reign of Shapur II after Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 312, and the identification of Christians as possible collaborators with the enemy Christians living in the Sasanian Empire were persecuted from 339 onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Neusner |first= Jacob |title=  Babylonian Jewry And Shapur Ii's Persecution of Christianity From 339 to 379&nbsp;CE |journal= Hebrew Union College Annual |volume= 43 |pages=  77\u2013102 |publisher=  Hebrew Union College Press |year = 1972 }}</ref> Shapur II also imposed a double tax on the Christians during his war campaign against the Romans.

In the first, a Persian priest proclaimed from the walls that only a ''dajjal'' was fated to capture the city. A ''dajjal'' is an Islamic term for an ''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'', a false messiah, compatible to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity. In everyday use, it also means \"deceiver\" or \"imposter\". Siyah, a Persian general who had defected to Muslim side, claimed that by converting to Islam he had turned his back on Zoroastrianism and was thus a ''dajjal''. Abu Musa agreed to Siyah's plan. Soon after as the sun came up one morning, the sentries on the walls saw a man in a Persian officer's uniform covered in blood lying on the ground before the main gate. Thinking it he had been left out overnight after a conflict the previous day, they opened the gate and some came out to collect him. As they approached, Siyah jumped up and killed them. Before the other sentries had time to react, Siyah and a small group of Muslim soldiers hidden nearby charged through the open gate.

In [[Historiography|historic literature]], Susa appears in the very earliest Sumerian records: for example, it is described as one of the places obedient to [[Inanna]], patron deity of [[Uruk]], in ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''.\n\n=== Biblical texts ===\n\nSusa is also mentioned in the [[Ketuvim]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the name Shushan, mainly in [[Book of Esther|Esther]], but also once each in [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. According to these texts, Nehemiah also lived in Susa during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th century BCE (Daniel mentions it in a prophetic vision), while [[Esther]] became queen there, married to [[Ahasuerus|King Ahasuerus]], and saved the Jews from genocide. A tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area, known as ''Shush-Daniel''. However, a large portion of the current structure is actually a much later construction dated to the late nineteenth century, ca. 1871.<ref>Kriwaczek, Paul. ''Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization'', St. Martin's Press, 2010, p. 5</ref> Susa is further mentioned in the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'' (8:21 & 9:2) as one of the places within the inheritance of [[Shem]] and his eldest son Elam; and in 8:1, \"Susan\" is also named as the son (or daughter, in some translations) of Elam.\n\n== Excavation history ==\n\n[[File:Susa map.jpg|thumb|Site of Susa]]\n[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2344.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria.

Based on C14 dating, the foundation of a settlement there occurred as early as 4395&nbsp;BCE (a calibrated radio-carbon date).<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 46.</ref> At this stage it was already very large for the time,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} about 15 hectares.\n\nThe founding of Susa corresponded with the abandonment of nearby villages. Potts suggests that the settlement may have been founded to try to reestablish the previously destroyed settlement at [[Chogha Mish]].<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\">Potts: ''Elam''.</ref> Previously, Chogha Mish was also a very large settlement, and it featured a similar massive platform that was later built at Susa.\n\nAnother important settlement in the area is [[Chogha Bonut]], that was discovered in 1976.\n\n=== Susa I period ===\n\nShortly after Susa was first settled over 6000&nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape.<ref>[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/saoc63.pdf] Hole, Frank. \"A Monumental Failure: The Collapse of Susa\".

Two settlements named by archaeologists ''Acropolis'' (7 ha) and ''Apadana'' (6.3 ha), would later merge to form Susa proper (18 ha).<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\"/> The ''Apadana'' was enclosed by 6m thick walls of [[rammed earth]] (this particular place is named [[Apadana]] because it also contains a late [[Achaemenid]] structure of this type).\n\n[[File:Iran \u00e9poque d'Obeid S\u00e8vres.jpg|thumb|320px|Goblet and cup, Iran, Susa I style, 4th millennium BC \u2013 [[Ubaid period]]; goblet height c. 12&nbsp;cm; [[S\u00e8vres \u2013 Cit\u00e9 de la c\u00e9ramique]], France]]\n\nNearly two thousand pots of ''Susa I'' style were recovered from the cemetery, most of them now in the [[Louvre]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\">{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}</ref>\nPainted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium BC.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\"/> Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types\u2014a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar\u2014implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}</ref> The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.\n\nCopper metallurgy is also attested during this period, which was contemporary with metalwork at some highland Iranian sites such as [[Tepe Sialk]].\n\n=== Susa II and Uruk influence ===\n\n[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|Globular envelope with the accounting tokens. Clay, Uruk period (c. 3500 BCE). From the Tell of the Acropolis in Susa. [[The Louvre]]]]\n\nSusa came within the Uruk cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture is found at Susa. According to some scholars, Susa may have been a colony of Uruk.\n\nThere is some dispute about the comparative [[periodization]] of Susa and Uruk at this time, as well as about the extent of Uruk influence in Susa. Recent research indicates that Early Uruk period corresponds to Susa II period.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} p58</ref>\n\nD. T. Potts, argue that the influence from the highland Iranian [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]] area in Susa was more significant at the early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the [[alluvial plains]]. Also, Potts stresses the fact that the writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa's needs.

Also, he was the last from the [[Awan dynasty]] according to the Susa kinglist.<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 122.</ref> He unified the neighbouring territories and became the king of [[Elam]]. He encouraged the use of the [[Linear Elamite]] script, that remains undeciphered.\n\nThe city was subsequently conquered by the neo-Sumerian [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] and held until Ur finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites under Kindattu in ca. 2004&nbsp;BCE. At this time, Susa became an Elamite capital under the Epartid dynasty.\n\n==== Middle Elamite period ====\nAround 1500 BCE, the Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties. Their rule was characterized by an \"Elamisation\" of Susa, and the kings took the title \"king of Anshan and Susa\". While, previously, the Akkadian language was frequently used in inscriptions, the succeeding kings, such as the Igihalkid dynasty of c. 1400&nbsp;BCE, tried to use Elamite. Thus, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.<ref name=\"The history of Elam\"/>\n\nThis was also the period when the Elamite pantheon was being imposed in Susiana. This policy reached its height with the construction of the political and religious complex at [[Chogha Zanbil]], {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of Susa.\n\nIn ca. 1175&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] plundered the original [[stele]] bearing the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' and took it to Susa.

Siyah, a Persian general who had defected to Muslim side, claimed that by converting to Islam he had turned his back on Zoroastrianism and was thus a ''dajjal''. Abu Musa agreed to Siyah's plan. Soon after as the sun came up one morning, the sentries on the walls saw a man in a Persian officer's uniform covered in blood lying on the ground before the main gate. Thinking it he had been left out overnight after a conflict the previous day, they opened the gate and some came out to collect him. As they approached, Siyah jumped up and killed them. Before the other sentries had time to react, Siyah and a small group of Muslim soldiers hidden nearby charged through the open gate.
