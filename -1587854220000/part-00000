The film stars [[Chris Hemsworth]], Rudhraksh Jaiswal, [[Randeep Hooda]], [[Priyanshu Painyuli]], [[Golshifteh Farahani]], [[Pankaj Tripathi]], Suraj Rikame, and [[David Harbour]]. The plot follows a black ops mercenary who must rescue a Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].\n\nThe film was released on April 24, 2020, by [[Netflix]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Hemsworth's performance and the stunt work, but lamented the story and excessive violence.\n\n==Plot==\nTyler Rake, a black-market mercenary, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan to rescue Ovi Mahajan Jr., the son of India's biggest drug lord Ovi Mahajan Sr., from [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] because he is held for ransom by Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, Amir Asif.\n\nWhilst Rake is in the process of extracting Ovi from his kidnappers, Saju, a former Special Forces soldier and Ovi's father's chief henchman, attempts to bring the boy back, doing so in fear of his family being killed and in order to avoid paying the substantial ransom money, which neither he nor Ovi's currently incarcerated father can afford. Elsewhere, Asif calls for an immediate [[lockdown]] of Dhaka.\n\nAfter escaping Saju and the corrupt police and elite force, both of which are controlled by Asif \u2014 Rake and Ovi encounter Farhad, a boy who wants to prove himself to Amir by killing Rake, and his gang. Rake fights off but does not kill the boys. They are later picked up by an old friend and retired former squad mate of Rake's living in Dhaka, Gaspar. Taking the pair to his home, he and Rake catch up before Gaspar leaves and Rake takes food upstairs to Ovi. The two talk about Rake's six-year-old son who died of [[lymphoma]]. When Gaspar returns home, he tries to convince Rake to give up Ovi and reveals to him that Asif is actually his friend who he cannot betray. He and Rake fight and Ovi finds the two mid-fight. Gaspar starts to explain and approaches Ovi but Ovi ends up shooting Gaspar twice and kills him. \n\nRake phones Saju and asks for his help, forcing them to team up against the police and elite force in order to escape Dhaka. Rake draws attention away from Saju and Ovi as the two make their way through a bridge checkpoint. Rake makes his way back towards the bridge along with Khan's extraction team of mercenaries as Asif watches from afar. During the ensuing firefight, Saju is sniped by Asif's colonel who is then in turn sniped by Khan. Rake continues to cover the extraction and is severely wounded in the shootout. He instructs Ovi to run towards an awaiting helicopter and continues firing with the intent to follow. Ovi watches alongside Khan as Rake makes his way towards the helicopter, only to be shot in the side of the neck by Farhad. Rake drags himself to the side of the bridge and falls over the barrier into the river. Ovi, Khan and the extraction team escape to [[Mumbai]], [[India]].\n  \nEight months later, Asif is killed by Khan in the washroom of a restaurant. Ovi jumps into his school's swimming pool and as he surfaces sees a white man watching over him, probably Rake.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Tyler Rake, a former [[SASR]] operator turned mercenary\n* Rudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan Jr., the son of Indian crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr.\n* [[Randeep Hooda]] as Saju, a former [[Para (Special Forces)]] operator and henchman of Ovi Mahajan Sr.\n* [[Priyanshu Painyuli]] as Amir Asif, a Bangladeshi crime lord who kidnapped Ovi\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Nik Khan, a mercenary and partner of Rake\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Ovi Mahajan Sr., an Indian crime lord and father of Ovi\n* Suraj Rikame as Farhad, a young boy turned henchmen of Amir\n* [[David Harbour]] as Gaspar, a teammate of Tyler living in Dhaka\n* Adam Bessa as Yaz Khan\n* [[Shataf Figar]] as Colonel of Bangladeshi Elite force working for Amir\n* [[Neha Mahajan]] as Neysa \u2014 Wife of Saju\n* [[Sam Hargrave]] as Gaetan\n\n==Production==\nOn August 31, 2018, it was announced that [[Sam Hargrave]] would direct ''Dhaka'' from a screenplay by [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"details\">{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/chris-hemsworth-dhaka-agbo-india-extraction-drama-sam-hargrave-joe-russo-anthony-russo-1202454550/ |title=Busy AGBO Sets India Kidnap Drama 'Dhaka' At Netflix: Chris Hemsworth Stars & Sam Hargrave Helms Joe Russo Script |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike, Jr. |last=Fleming |date=August 30, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> In addition, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was set to star in the film.<ref name=\"details\"/> In November 2018, the rest of the cast was set.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/david-harbour-joins-chris-hemsworth-action-movie-dhaka-1162067|title=David Harbour Joins Chris Hemsworth in Russo Brothers Action Movie 'Dhaka' (Exclusive) |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=November 16, 2018 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Filming\"/>\n\nProduction began in [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Mumbai]] in November 2018.<ref name=\"Filming\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/netflix-chris-hemsworth-dhaka-india-golshifteh-farahani-russo-brothers-1202510896/|title=Russo Brothers Wrap Indian Leg of Netflix Pic 'Dhaka' With Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Golshifteh Farahani |first1=Andreas |last1=Wiseman |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Filming next took place in [[Ban Pong]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Thailand]] and plateshots in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].

They asked the natives the name of the place pointing to the vast expanse of land covered with tall reed grasses called tigbaw. The natives thinking that the Spaniards were asking for the name of the grass quickly answered Tigbaw. Since then the place was called Tigbaw. The word eventually evolved into Tibiao. Allegedly, the Spaniards had difficulty pronouncing the word Tigbaw.\n\nThe old settlement was in present-day Balanti-an. The Natives had to relocate to the said place since it is quite secluded and distant from the shore. It is secure from piratical raids common during those days. The place is near the edge of the present-day Tibiao River (sa Tib\u00ed Kang sub\u00e2). Sojourners to the place would comment: Tibi haw? It is a question asking why they locate themselves at the edge of the river. The term tib\u00ed haw eventually evolved into Tibiao. Since then the Place was called Tibiao\n\n\no0o\n\nTibiao was part of Nalupa from 1596\u20131840. Nalupa, with its central government in present-day Jinalinan controlled the area of what is now Tibiao, Barbaza, and Laua-an. In early 1730, Nalupa gradually depopulated due to the Moro pirate attacks. By 1733, Culasi had direct control of Nalupa and Pandan. In 1796, Nalupa ceded from Culasi. As an [[arrabal]], notable village chieftains were Paris, Oguid Pagsuguiron, and Nicolas Amar (1818).\n\nIn 1786, Oguid Datu Oguid landed in the shores of Calawgan Creek. He brought with him his family and settlers from an unspecified place in Borneo, presumably from a place where Kinaray-a is the lingua franca.\n\nOn August 6, 1786, Oguid and followers settled in what is now Kamyabsan or a place where guavas. Kamyabsan is now part of Sawang Sitio in Malabor. The site was near the shore and accessible to pirate raids. They later transferred to Balanti-an to coexist with the natives. when Datu Oguid Arrive in Balanti-an he was confronted by the \"Tumandoks\" and they cannot understand each other. The fact they cannot understand each other Datu Oguid Offered foods for them and which we call <u>[[Panguyang]] or [[Padu-um]]</u> to become friends. After such abundant blessing shared for each other, they made some enjoyment dancing the zarzuela and singing the composo and Sugidanon.\n\nIn 1815, Oguid sent a delegation to Nalupa to petition the Governor of Antique, Rafael Andres Gomez, to make Tibiao a new town separating from Nalupa.

The Governor of Antique that time was Juan Ormido while the Teniente Municipal of Nalupa was a certain Vislilla. Tibiao remained as a vista of Nalupa. Tibiao did not have church or a priest attend to the spiritual needs of the People.\n\nIn 1826, Oguid never became the Teniente Municipal of Tibiao but he was the one who orchestrated the affairs of the town. On May two 1926,  he called for a meeting where it was agreed to hold a Thanksgiving and to build a church in their settlement. The church was 20x10x4 yards in dimension with thatched palm leaf roofing and of walls of wooden slabs. The Teniente municipal of Tibiao at that time was Juan Mariano.\n\nOn November 1, 1826, Oguid and Governor Martinez planted a cross on a mountain east of the settlement; the mountain is presently called Mount Cruz to commemorate the event. A Thanksgiving mass, mass wedding and baptism were held the next day. Festivities followed.\n\nOn November 6, 1828, Oguid chose five men to survey the proposed new town site. The site selected was between Calaugan and Palaypay creeks. It was Juan Amar Sarcino who drafted the town plan. The development of the site immediately began. A church and a convent were constructed, wooden bridges built to span the Calaugan and Palaypay creeks, road laids, drainage canals, and a cemetery were built.  The Teniente Municipal at that time was Mariano Delos Santos while the Governor of Antique was Francisco Oreta. \n\nThe Parish of Tibiao was established by the Augustinian missionaries in \nIn 1849.\n\nIn 1851 Fr.

They asked the natives the name of the place pointing to the vast expanse of land covered with tall Reed grasses called tigbaw. The natives thinking that the Spaniards were asking for the name of the grass quickly answered Tigbaw. Since then the place was called Tigbaw. The word eventually evolved into Tibiao. Allegedly, the Spaniards had difficulty pronouncing the word Tigbaw.\n\nThe old settlement was in present-day Balanti-an. The Natives had to relocate to the said place since it is quite secluded and distant from the shore. It is secure from piratical raids common during those days. The place is near the edge of the present day Tibiao River (sa Tib\u00ed Kang sub\u00e2). Sojourners to the place would comment: Tibi haw? It is a question asking why they locate themselves at the edge of the river. The term tib\u00ed haw eventually evolved into Tibiao. Since then the Place was called Tibiao\n\n\no0o\n\nTibiao was part of Nalupa from 1596\u20131840.
