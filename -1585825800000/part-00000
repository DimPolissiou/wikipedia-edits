External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings. The [[Radiata]], animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s classification of the [[animal]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=McBirney |first1=Alexander |title=Georges Cuvier.

Typically, this involves repeating a body part 4, 5, 6 or 8 times around the axis - referred to as tetramerism, pentamerism, hexamerism and octomerism, respectively. Such organisms exhibits no left or right sides but do have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.\n\nGeorge Cuvier classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon Radiata (''Zoophytes''),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben M. |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=8 March 2018 |quote=Cuvier's insistence on the functional integration of organisms led him to classify animals into four \"branches,\" or embranchements: Vertebrata, Articulata (arthropods and segmented worms), Mollusca (which at the time meant all other soft, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates), and Radiata (cnidarians and echinoderms).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |author1link=Georges Cuvier |last2=Griffith |first2=Edward |last3=Pidgeon |first3=Edward |title=The Mollusca and Radiata: Arranged by the Baron Cuvier, with Supplementary Additions to Each Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mskQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA435 |year=1834 |publisher=Whittaker and Company |pages=435\u2013}}</ref> which is now generally accepted to be an assemblage of different animal phyla that do not share a single common ancestor (a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group).<ref>{{cite book |last=Hadzi |first=J. |title=The Evolution of the Metazoa |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0080100791 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz/page/56 56\u201357]}}</ref> Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth[[Talk:Ancient Greek medicine|,]] to the center of the opposite (aboral) end.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits. This is easily seen through the arrangement of five [[carpel]]s (seed pockets) in an [[apple]] when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]]. Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism.

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures.

Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]].

The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism.

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other.

Archaeologically, many elements link Celtiberians with [[Celts]] in Central Europe, but also show large differences with both the [[Hallstatt culture]] and [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]. \n\nThere is no complete agreement on the exact definition of Celtiberians among classical authors, nor modern scholars. The [[Ebro river]] clearly divides the Celtiberian areas from non-Indo-European speaking peoples.<ref>Roman History, Book XVIII \"Cato sailed away and reached Spain, where he learned that all the inhabitants as far as the Iberus (Ebro river) had united in order to wage war against him in a body. After organizing his army he attacked and defeated them and forced them to submit to him, since they feared that otherwise they might lose their cities at a single stroke. At the time he did them no harm, but later, when some of them incurred his suspicion, he deprived them all of their arms and caused the natives themselves to tear down their own walls. For he sent letters in all directions with orders that they should be delivered to everybody on the same day; and in these he commanded the people to raze their walls immediately, threatening the disobedient with death. The officials upon reading the letters thought in each case that message had been written to them alone, and without taking time for deliberation they all threw down their walls. Cato now crossed the Iberus, and though he did not dare to contend with the Celtiberian allies of the enemy on account of their number, yet he handled them in marvellous fashion, now persuading them by a gift of larger pay to change front and join him, now admonishing them to return home, and sometimes even announcing a battle with them for a stated day. The result was that they broke up into separate factions and became so fearful that they no longer ventured to fight with him.\"</ref> In other directions, the demarcation is less clear. Most scholars include the [[Arevaci]], [[Pellendones]], [[Belli]], [[Titii (Celtiberian)|Titti]] and [[Lusones]] as Celtiberian tribes, and occasionally the [[Berones]], [[Vaccaei]], [[Carpetani]], [[Olcades]] or [[Lobetani]].<ref>The Celts in Iberia: An Overview, e-Keltoi: Volume 6 https://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_4/lorrio_zapatero_6_4.html</ref>\n\nIn 195 BC, part of Celtiberia was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and by 72 BC the entire region had become part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Hispania Citerior]].

Archaeologists [[Mart\u00edn Almagro Gorbea]] and Alvarado Lorrio recognize the distinguishing iron tools and extended family social structure of developed Celtiberian culture as evolving from the archaic ''castro'' culture which they consider \"proto-Celtic\".\n\nArchaeological finds identify the culture as continuous with the culture reported by Classical writers from the late 3rd century onwards (Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio). The ethnic map of Celtiberia was highly localized however, composed of different tribes and ''nations'' from the 3rd century centered upon fortified ''[[Oppidum|oppida]]'' and representing a wide-ranging degree of local assimilation with the autochthonous cultures in a mixed Celtic and Iberian stock.\n[[File:Mapa celtiberos.jpg|thumb|Territory of the [[Celtiberi]] with possible location of tribes]]\n[[File:F\u00edbula celt\u00edbera de Lancia (M.A.N. 22925) 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bronze Celtiberian [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] representing a warrior (3rd\u20132nd century BC)]]\nThe cultural stronghold of Celtiberians was the northern area of the central ''[[Meseta Central|meseta]]'' in the upper valleys of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] east to the ''Iberus'' ([[Ebro]]) river, in the modern provinces of [[Soria (province)|Soria]],  [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]], [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]] and [[Teruel (province)|Teruel]]. There, when Greek and Roman geographers and historians encountered them, the established Celtiberians were controlled by a military aristocracy that had become a hereditary elite. The dominant tribe were the [[Arevaci]], who dominated their neighbors from powerful strongholds at Okilis ([[Medinaceli]]) and who rallied the long Celtiberian resistance to Rome. Other Celtiberians were the [[Belli]] and [[Titii (Celtiberian)|Titti]] in the [[Jal\u00f3n (river)|Jal\u00f3n]] valley, and the [[Lusones]] to the east.\n\nExcavations at the Celtiberian strongholds ''Kontebakom-Bel'' [[Botorrita]], ''Sekaisa'' [[Segeda]], Tiermes<ref>[http://www.archaeospain.com/tiermes/tiermes1.htm The Site of Tiermes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112201646/http://www.archaeospain.com/tiermes/tiermes1.htm |date=January 12, 2005 }}, official website</ref> complement the grave goods found in Celtiberian cemeteries, where aristocratic tombs of the 6th to 5th centuries BC give way to warrior tombs with a tendency from the 3rd century BC for weapons to disappear from grave goods, either indicating an increased urgency for their distribution among living fighters or, as Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio think, the increased urbanization of Celtiberian society. Many late Celtiberian ''oppida'' are still occupied by modern towns, inhibiting archaeology.\n\nMetalwork stands out in Celtiberian archaeological finds, partly from its indestructible nature, emphasizing Celtiberian articles of warlike uses, horse trappings and prestige weapons. The two-edged sword adopted by the Romans was previously in use among the Celtiberians, and Latin ''lancea'', a thrown spear, was a Hispanic word, according to [[Varro]]. Celtiberian culture was increasingly influenced by Rome in the two final centuries BC.\n\nFrom the 3rd century, the [[clan]] was superseded as the basic Celtiberian political unit by the ''[[oppidum]]'', a fortified organized city with a defined territory that included the ''castros'' as subsidiary settlements. These ''civitates'' as the Roman historians called them, could make and break alliances, as surviving inscribed hospitality pacts attest, and minted coinage. The old clan structures lasted in the formation of the Celtiberian armies, organized along clan-structure lines, with consequent losses of strategic and tactical control.\n\n===Late period===\n[[File:Pu\u00f1ales biglobulares (Museo numantino).jpg|thumb|150px|Celtiberian biglobular daggers]]\n[[File:Espadas de antenas celt\u00edberas.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Celtiberian antennas swords]]\nThe Celtiberians were the most influential ethnic group in Iberia when the Mediterranean powers ([[Carthage]] and [[Rome]]) started their conquests. In 220 BC, the Punic army was attacked when preparing to cross the Tagus river by a coalition of [[Vaccei]], [[Carpetani]] and [[Olcades]]. Despite these clashes, during the [[Second Punic War]] the Celtiberians served most often as allies or mercenaries of [[Carthage]] in its conflict with Rome, and crossed the [[Alps]] in the mixed forces under [[Hannibal]]'s command. Under [[Scipio Africanus]], the Romans were able to secure alliances and change the allegiances of many Celtiberian tribes, using these allied warriors against the Carthaginian forces and allies in Spain.  After the conflict, Rome took possession of the Punic empire in Spain, and some Celtiberians soon challenged the new dominant power that loomed in the borders of its territory. [[Tiberius Gracchus the Elder|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]] spent the years 182 to 179 pacifying the Celtiberians. Gracchus boasted of destroying over 300 Celtiberian settlements.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Celts: Bronze Age to New Age |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=54}}</ref>\n\nIn 155 BC, a raid into [[Hispania Ulterior]] (Farther Spain) by the [[Lusitani]] and the defeat of two successive Roman praetors encouraged the town of [[Segeda]] in [[Hispania Citerior]] (Nearer Spain) to rebel. The following year, it refused to pay tribute or provide a military contingent to Rome but formed instead a confederacy with neighboring towns and began the construction of a defensive wall. [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior]] was sent against the Celtiberians in 153 BC, with nearly 30,000 men. But the consul was late in arriving and ambushed soon after, with 6,000 Romans slain. A siege of [[Numantia]] several days later, where the Segedans had taken refuge, was no more successful. Three elephants were brought up against the town walls but became frightened and turned on the Romans, who retreated in confusion. There were other setbacks, and the hapless Nobilior was obliged to withdraw to camp, where more men suffered frostbite and died of the winter cold. Nobilior lost over 10,000 men in his campaign.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain |date=2013 |publisher=Pen and Sword}}</ref> In 137 BC, the Celtiberians forced the surrender of a 20,000-man Roman consular army led by [[Gaius Hostilius Mancinus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Wars |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |page=339}}</ref> In 134 BC, the consul [[Scipio Aemilianus]] took charge of the demoralized Roman troops in Spain and laid [[Siege of Numantia|siege to Numantia]].\n\n[[File:RUSSELL(1854) p182 Siege of Numantia.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of the [[Siege of Numantia]]]]\nNearby fields were laid waste and what was not used burned. The stronghold of Numantia then was circumvallated with a ditch and palisade, behind which was a wall ten feet high. Towers were placed every hundred feet and mounted with [[catapult]]s and [[ballistae]]. To blockade the nearby river, logs were placed in the water, moored by ropes on the shore. Knives and spear heads were embedded in the wood, which rotated in the strong current. Allied tribes were ordered to send reinforcements. Even [[Jugurtha]], who later would revolt from Rome, himself, was sent from [[Numidia]] with twelve war elephants. The Roman forces now numbered 60,000 men and were arrayed around the besieged town in seven camps. The Numantines, \"ready though they were to die, no opportunity was given them of fighting\".<ref>Florus, I.34.13</ref>\n\nThere were several desperate attempts to break out but they were repulsed. Nor could there be any help from neighboring towns. Eventually, as their hunger increased, envoys were sent to Scipio, asking if they would be treated with moderation if they surrendered, pleading that they had fought for their women and children, and the freedom of their country. But Scipio would accept only deditio. Hearing this demand for absolute submission, the Numantines, \"who were previously savage in temper because of their absolute freedom and quite unaccustomed to obey the orders of others, and were now wilder than ever and beside themselves by reason of their hardships,\" slew their own ambassadors.\n\nAfter eight months, the starving population was reduced to cannibalism and, filthy and foul smelling, compelled to surrender. But, \"such was the love of liberty and of valour which existed in this small barbarian town,\" relates [[Appian]], that many chose to kill themselves rather than capitulate. Families poisoned themselves, weapons were burned, and the beleaguered town set ablaze. There had been only about 8,000 fighting men when the war began; half that number survived to garrison Numantia. Only a pitiable few survived to walk in Scipio's triumph. The others were sold as slaves and the town razed to the ground, the territory divided among its neighbors.\n\n[[File:Botorrita 1.jpg|thumb|[[Botorrita plaque]]: one of four bronze plates with inscriptions.]]\nAfter Numantia was finally taken and destroyed, Roman cultural influences increased; this is the period of the earliest [[Botorrita plaque|Botorrita inscribed plaque]]; later plaques, significantly, are inscribed in [[Latin]].

They were explicitly mentioned as being [[Celts]] by several classic authors (e.g. Strabo<ref name=strabo>{{cite book|last=Strabo|authorlink=Strabo|title=Geography|at=Book III Chapter 4 verses 5 and 12|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3D*.html}}</ref>).

Archaeologically, many elements link Celtiberians with [[Celts]] in Central Europe, but also show large differences with both the [[Hallstatt culture]] and [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]. \n\nThere is no complete agreement on the exact definition of Celtiberians among classical authors, nor modern scholars. The [[Ebro river]] clearly divides the Celtiberian areas from non-Indo-European speaking peoples.<ref>Roman History, Book XVIII \"Cato sailed away and reached Spain, where he learned that all the inhabitants as far as the Iberus (Ebro river) had united in order to wage war against him in a body. After organizing his army he attacked and defeated them and forced them to submit to him, since they feared that otherwise they might lose their cities at a single stroke. At the time he did them no harm, but later, when some of them incurred his suspicion, he deprived them all of their arms and caused the natives themselves to tear down their own walls. For he sent letters in all directions with orders that they should be delivered to everybody on the same day; and in these he commanded the people to raze their walls immediately, threatening the disobedient with death. The officials upon reading the letters thought in each case that message had been written to them alone, and without taking time for deliberation they all threw down their walls. Cato now crossed the Iberus, and though he did not dare to contend with the Celtiberian allies of the enemy on account of their number, yet he handled them in marvellous fashion, now persuading them by a gift of larger pay to change front and join him, now admonishing them to return home, and sometimes even announcing a battle with them for a stated day. The result was that they broke up into separate factions and became so fearful that they no longer ventured to fight with him.\"</ref> In other directions, the demarcation is less clear. Most scholars include the [[Arevaci]], [[Pellendones]], [[Belli]], [[Titii (Celtiberian)|Titti]] and [[Lusones]] as Celtiberian tribes, and occasionally the [[Berones]], [[Vaccaei]], [[Carpetani]], [[Olcades]] or [[Lobetani]].<ref>The Celts in Iberia: An Overview, e-Keltoi: Volume 6 https://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_4/lorrio_zapatero_6_4.html</ref>\n\nIn 195 BC, part of Celtiberia was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and by 72 BC the entire region had become part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Hispania Citerior]]. The subjugated Celtiberians waged a protracted struggle against the Roman conquerors, staging uprisings in 195\u2013193, [[First Celtiberian War|181\u2013179]], [[Second Celtiberian War|153\u2013151]], and [[Numantine War|143\u2013133]]. In 105 BC, Celtiberian warriors drove the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cimbri]] from Spain in the [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101 BC) and also played an important role in the [[Sertorian War]] (80\u201372 BC).\n\n==Origin of the term==\n\nThe term ''Celtiberi'' appears in accounts by [[Diodorus Siculus]],<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html Celtiberian manners and customs in Diodorus Siculus v. 33\u201334; Diodorus relies on lost texts of [[Posidonius]].]</ref> [[Appian]]<ref>Appian of Alexandria, ''Roman History''.</ref> and [[Martial]]<ref>[[Bilbilis (Augusta Bilbilis)|Bilbilis]] was the birthplace of [[Martial]].</ref> who recognized intermarriage between Celts and [[Iberians]] after a period of continuous warfare, though [[Barry Cunliffe]] says \"this has the ring of guesswork about it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts: a very short introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=52}}</ref> [[Strabo]] just saw the Celtiberians as a branch of the [[Celts|''Celti'']].<ref name=strabo/> [[Pliny the Elder]] thought that the original home of the Celts in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] was the territory of the [[Celtici]] in the south-west, on the grounds of an identity of sacred rites, language, and the names of cities.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aAkFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA583&dq=lusitanians+celtic+people&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=lusitanians%20celtic%20people&f=false Sir William Smith (1854), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', Volume 2, Boston: Little, Brown and Company.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n{{see|Castro culture}}\n[[File:Greek and Phoenician Colonies in The Iberian Peninsula.png|thumb|right|500px|Main language areas, peoples and tribes in Iberian Peninsula c. 300 BC., according to epigraphy and toponymy, based on the map by Lu\u00eds Fraga]]\nStrabo cites [[Ephorus]]'s belief that there were Celts in the Iberian peninsula as far as [[Cadiz]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Strabo|authorlink=Strabo|encyclopedia= The Geography of Strabo; with an English translation by Horace Leonard Jones |edition=Loeb Classical Library |volume=II, book IV, chapter 4|year=1923|publisher=Heinemann |location=London |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4D*.html}}</ref> The material culture of the north-western regions of the Iberian Peninsula showed continuity from the end of the Bronze Age (c. 9th century BC) until it was subsumed by Roman culture (c. 1st century BC).

Archaeologists [[Mart\u00edn Almagro Gorbea]] and Alvarado Lorrio recognize the distinguishing iron tools and extended family social structure of developed Celtiberian culture as evolving from the archaic ''castro'' culture which they consider \"proto-Celtic\".\n\nArchaeological finds identify the culture as continuous with the culture reported by Classical writers from the late 3rd century onwards (Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio). The ethnic map of Celtiberia was highly localized however, composed of different tribes and ''nations'' from the 3rd century centered upon fortified ''[[Oppidum|oppida]]'' and representing a wide-ranging degree of local assimilation with the autochthonous cultures in a mixed Celtic and Iberian stock.\n[[File:Mapa celtiberos.jpg|thumb|Territory of the [[Celtiberi]] with possible location of tribes]]\n[[File:F\u00edbula celt\u00edbera de Lancia (M.A.N. 22925) 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bronze Celtiberian [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] representing a warrior (3rd\u20132nd century BC)]]\nThe cultural stronghold of Celtiberians was the northern area of the central ''[[Meseta Central|meseta]]'' in the upper valleys of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] east to the ''Iberus'' ([[Ebro]]) river, in the modern provinces of [[Soria (province)|Soria]],  [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]], [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]] and [[Teruel (province)|Teruel]]. There, when Greek and Roman geographers and historians encountered them, the established Celtiberians were controlled by a military aristocracy that had become a hereditary elite. The dominant tribe were the [[Arevaci]], who dominated their neighbors from powerful strongholds at Okilis ([[Medinaceli]]) and who rallied the long Celtiberian resistance to Rome. Other Celtiberians were the [[Belli]] and [[Titii (Celtiberian)|Titti]] in the [[Jal\u00f3n (river)|Jal\u00f3n]] valley, and the [[Lusones]] to the east.\n\nExcavations at the Celtiberian strongholds ''Kontebakom-Bel'' [[Botorrita]], ''Sekaisa'' [[Segeda]], Tiermes<ref>[http://www.archaeospain.com/tiermes/tiermes1.htm The Site of Tiermes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112201646/http://www.archaeospain.com/tiermes/tiermes1.htm |date=January 12, 2005 }}, official website</ref> complement the grave goods found in Celtiberian cemeteries, where aristocratic tombs of the 6th to 5th centuries BC give way to warrior tombs with a tendency from the 3rd century BC for weapons to disappear from grave goods, either indicating an increased urgency for their distribution among living fighters or, as Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio think, the increased urbanization of Celtiberian society. Many late Celtiberian ''oppida'' are still occupied by modern towns, inhibiting archaeology.\n\nMetalwork stands out in Celtiberian archaeological finds, partly from its indestructible nature, emphasizing Celtiberian articles of warlike uses, horse trappings and prestige weapons. The two-edged sword adopted by the Romans was previously in use among the Celtiberians, and Latin ''lancea'', a thrown spear, was a Hispanic word, according to [[Varro]]. Celtiberian culture was increasingly influenced by Rome in the two final centuries BC.\n\nFrom the 3rd century, the [[clan]] was superseded as the basic Celtiberian political unit by the ''[[oppidum]]'', a fortified organized city with a defined territory that included the ''castros'' as subsidiary settlements. These ''civitates'' as the Roman historians called them, could make and break alliances, as surviving inscribed hospitality pacts attest, and minted coinage. The old clan structures lasted in the formation of the Celtiberian armies, organized along clan-structure lines, with consequent losses of strategic and tactical control.\n\n===Late period===\n[[File:Pu\u00f1ales biglobulares (Museo numantino).jpg|thumb|150px|Celtiberian biglobular daggers]]\n[[File:Espadas de antenas celt\u00edberas.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Celtiberian antennas swords]]\nThe Celtiberians were the most influential ethnic group in Iberia when the Mediterranean powers ([[Carthage]] and [[Rome]]) started their conquests. In 220 BC, the Punic army was attacked when preparing to cross the Tagus river by a coalition of [[Vaccei]], [[Carpetani]] and [[Olcades]]. Despite these clashes, during the [[Second Punic War]] the Celtiberians served most often as allies or mercenaries of [[Carthage]] in its conflict with Rome, and crossed the [[Alps]] in the mixed forces under [[Hannibal]]'s command. Under [[Scipio Africanus]], the Romans were able to secure alliances and change the allegiances of many Celtiberian tribes, using these allied warriors against the Carthaginian forces and allies in Spain.  After the conflict, Rome took possession of the Punic empire in Spain, and some Celtiberians soon challenged the new dominant power that loomed in the borders of its territory. [[Tiberius Gracchus the Elder|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]] spent the years 182 to 179 pacifying the Celtiberians. Gracchus boasted of destroying over 300 Celtiberian settlements.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Celts: Bronze Age to New Age |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=54}}</ref>\n\nIn 155 BC, a raid into [[Hispania Ulterior]] (Farther Spain) by the [[Lusitani]] and the defeat of two successive Roman praetors encouraged the town of [[Segeda]] in [[Hispania Citerior]] (Nearer Spain) to rebel. The following year, it refused to pay tribute or provide a military contingent to Rome but formed instead a confederacy with neighboring towns and began the construction of a defensive wall. [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior]] was sent against the Celtiberians in 153 BC, with nearly 30,000 men. But the consul was late in arriving and ambushed soon after, with 6,000 Romans slain. A siege of [[Numantia]] several days later, where the Segedans had taken refuge, was no more successful. Three elephants were brought up against the town walls but became frightened and turned on the Romans, who retreated in confusion. There were other setbacks, and the hapless Nobilior was obliged to withdraw to camp, where more men suffered frostbite and died of the winter cold. Nobilior lost over 10,000 men in his campaign.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain |date=2013 |publisher=Pen and Sword}}</ref> In 137 BC, the Celtiberians forced the surrender of a 20,000-man Roman consular army led by [[Gaius Hostilius Mancinus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Wars |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |page=339}}</ref> In 134 BC, the consul [[Scipio Aemilianus]] took charge of the demoralized Roman troops in Spain and laid [[Siege of Numantia|siege to Numantia]].\n\n[[File:RUSSELL(1854) p182 Siege of Numantia.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of the [[Siege of Numantia]]]]\nNearby fields were laid waste and what was not used burned. The stronghold of Numantia then was circumvallated with a ditch and palisade, behind which was a wall ten feet high.
