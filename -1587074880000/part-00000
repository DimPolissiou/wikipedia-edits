The self-titled album was recognized with the group's first nomination at the 2006 [[East Coast Music Awards]], for Rock Recording of the Year. Their videos \"Better Sorry than Safe\", \"Stuck for the Summer\" and \"Jezebel\" have been in rotation on [[MuchMusic]].<ref>{{cite news| last =Cole| first =Sally| title =Road stories| newspaper =[[Charlottetown Guardian]]| date =2007-10-12| url =http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/index.cfm?sid=70451&sc=102| accessdate =2007-12-24 }}</ref> The group released a six-song [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Isolator (EP)|Isolator]]'' on September 26, 2006.
