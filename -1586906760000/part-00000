At the Boston audition, judge [[Kara DioGuardi]] called her one of the most talented 16-year-olds she had ever seen. In Hollywood, DioGuardi made the prediction, \"You could be the potential winner.\" On March 24, 2010, Stevens landed in the bottom 3 during elimination night, along with [[Paige Miles]] and [[Tim Urban]]. She was proclaimed safe, giving her a spot on the ''American Idol'' summer tour.\n\nMost of the critiques the judges gave her had been with regard to her pitch, age, and song choice. In her performance of \"[[Chain of Fools]]\", DioGuardi told her she had found where she belonged: [[R&B]]-[[Pop music|pop]], but she needed to work on being younger. She landed in the bottom three the following night but was declared safe, putting her into the Top 9.\n\nIn her Top 9 performance of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", all of the judges thought it was a huge improvement. [[Ellen DeGeneres|Ellen]] stated that she wouldn't be in the bottom 3 after that performance. [[Simon Cowell|Simon]] said that she had done what she was told by being [[Country music|Country]], while [[Kara DioGuardi|Kara]] and [[Randy Jackson|Randy]] disagreed, opining that she has more of an R&B sensibility. Nonetheless, her performance secured her a position in the Top 8. However, the Top 9 remained intact for another week due to the judges' save of [[Michael Lynche]]. She was eliminated from ''American Idol'' the following week on April 14, along with [[Andrew Garcia]]. Her elimination came second on the double elimination night. From July 1 to August 31, 2010 Stevens toured with the [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2010]].

At the Boston audition, judge [[Kara DioGuardi]] called her one of the most talented 16-year-olds she had ever seen. In Hollywood, DioGuardi made the prediction, \"You could be the potential winner.\" On March 24, 2010, Stevens landed in the bottom 3 during elimination night, along with [[Paige Miles]] and [[Tim Urban]]. She was proclaimed safe, giving her a spot on the ''American Idol'' summer tour.\n\nMost of the critiques the judges gave her had been with regard to her pitch, age, and song choice. In her performance of \"[[Chain of Fools]]\", DioGuardi told her she had found where she belonged: [[R&B]]-[[Pop music|pop]], but she needed to work on being younger. She landed in the bottom three the following night but was declared safe, putting her into the Top 9.\n\nIn her Top 9 performance of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", all of the judges thought it was a huge improvement. [[Ellen DeGeneres|Ellen]] stated that she wouldn't be in the bottom 3 after that performance. [[Simon Cowell|Simon]] said that she had done what she was told by being [[Country music|Country]], while [[Kara DioGuardi|Kara]] and [[Randy Jackson|Randy]] disagreed, opining that she has more of an R&B sensibility. Nonetheless, her performance secured her a position in the Top 8. However, the Top 9 remained intact for another week due to the judges' save of [[Michael Lynche]]. She was eliminated from ''American Idol'' the following week on April 14, along with [[Andrew Garcia]]. Her elimination came second on the double elimination night. From July 1 to August 31, 2010 Stevens toured with the [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2010]].

The species has a complex structure with many branches which resemble that of elk antlers, hence the common name. The branching structure creates habitat and shelter for many other reef species. Elkhorn corals are known to both grow quickly with an average growth rate of 5 to 10&nbsp;cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) per year as well as reproduce quickly. They can reproduce both sexually and asexually, though asexual reproduction is much more common and occurs through a process called fragmentation\n\nThough Elkhorn corals dominated the Caribbean in the early 1980s, they have since dramatically reduced in numbers. Scientists have estimated that from 1980 to its time of [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) listing in 2006, the population declined by around 97%. This was due to a variety of factors including disease, algae growth, climate change, ocean acidification, and human activity. In May 2006, Elkhorn corals were officially listed as threatened in the ESA along with another species in the Acropora genus, [[Staghorn coral]]s. Some conservation efforts are now in place to protect the species and promote increased genetic variability among the species.\n\n==Species Overview==\n\n=== Appearance ===\nElkhorn coral produce hard antler-like structures composed of calcium carbonate. These structures can be over 2 meters high and 13 meters wide and are a dull, brownish-yellow [Crabtree, 2014].\n\n=== Diet ===\nElkhorn coral\u2019s primary source of nutrients comes from photosynthetic algae, zooxanthellae, that live inside the coral\u2019s cells.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/elkhorn-coral|title=Elkhorn Coral {{!}} NOAA Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|date=2019-12-30|website=NOAA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Therefore, Elkhorn coral are highly dependent on the sunlight for sustenance, leaving Elkhorn coral vulnerable to increased turbidity or water clarity. During bleaching events, or long-term periods of increased turbidity, Elkhorn coral can obtain nourishment from alternative food sources through filter feeding.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/8950#|title=Welcome to the NOAA Institutional Repository {{!}}|website=repository.library.noaa.gov|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==== Zooxanthellae ====\nAs mentioned, Elkhorn coral have special algae living in their tissues known as zooxanthellae. Zoothanthellae meet their nutritional requirements using photosynthesis, a process that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen. The Elkhorn coral provides habitat for these algae, and, in turn, receive an abundant source of oxygen, enabling them to grow quickly.<ref name=\":2\">Crabtree, R. E (2014).

Retrieved From: <nowiki>https://esadocs.defenders-cci.org/ESAdocs/consultation/JDCOE_11222.pdf</nowiki></ref>\n\n==== Filter Feeding ====\nElkhorn coral can also use filter feeding techniques to obtain food. At night, Elkhorn coral use their tentacles to snatch free-swimming zooplankton from the water. Zooplankton complete daily diel migrations. In the morning, zooplankton sink to the depths of the ocean where predators are scarce, and then come nightfall, they rise back towards the surface. By concentrating their predation activities at night, Elkhorn coral expend less energy catching large amounts of prey.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, because filter feeding is more energy intensive than relying on Zooxanthellae, Elkhorn coral will only resort to this feeding method when water conditions are poor and block out sunlight.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/11/26/E8-27748/endangered-and-threatened-species-critical-habitat-for-threatened-elkhorn-and-staghorn-corals|title=Endangered and Threatened Species; Critical Habitat for Threatened Elkhorn and Staghorn Corals|date=2008-11-26|website=Federal Register|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n=== Habitat ===\nElkhorn coral live in shallow habitats, which give them abundant access to light. Like all animals, Elkhorn coral requires oxygen to survive, most of which they obtain through special, photosynthetic algae living in their tissues called zooxanthellae. Therefore, in order to help zooxanthellae produce as much oxygen as possible, Elkhorn live in shallow regions between 1 and 5 meters, to ensure that abundant light reaches the zooxanthellae, maximizing photosynthesis.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Evolution & Locations ===\n\n==== Niche Habitat ====\nElkhorn coral are one of three Caribbean corals, primarily found in the southeast region of the world. These corals are found in clear, shallow water throughout the Bahamas, Florida, the Caribbean, and beyond to the northern shores of Venezuela.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most northern region occupied by Elkhorn coral is the coast off of Broward County in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=8928|title=Species Profile|website=ecos.fws.gov|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Characteristically found in shallow, turbulent water ranging from 1 to 5 meters,\u00a0 Elkhorn coral thrives best in high-energy zones where wave action is frequent. This is because large amounts of fragmentation occurs which allows new colonies to form, one type of reproduction used by Elkhorn coral.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Niche Evolution ====\nDue to fragmentation and rapid growth rates, Elkhorn coral were the primary foundation in the development of the Caribbean coral reefs. Over the last 5,000 years, Elkhorn coral, staghorn coral, and star coral (boulder, lobed, and mountainous) comprised the southeastern reefs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Research has shown that the Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) evolved during the Mid-Pliocene epoch, 5.2-2.58 million years ago.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=McNeill|first=Donald|date=October 1997|title=Earlier (late Pliocene) first appearance of the Caribbean reef-building coral Acropora palmata: Stratigraphic and evolutionary implications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252747493_Earlier_late_Pliocene_first_appearance_of_the_Caribbean_reef-building_coral_Acropora_palmata_Stratigraphic_and_evolutionary_implications|journal=Geology|volume=25|pages=|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> The unstable climate during this period allowed Elkhorn coral to thrive during glacial and interglacial events.

The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary has served as a protected region for the area\u2019s coral species, and has also developed plans for the protection and restoration of elkhorn coral. Restoration efforts have included attempts to reattach coral fragments that were broken off during hurricanes or by ships. Attempts to reattach coral fragments have also occurred in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]], but all have had limited success.\n\nAttempts are also being made to conserve the coral by culturing coral fragments. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], and [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] all are having limited success with coral nurseries in the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA]]) has developed and tested several ecological methods to restore this coral, including removing coral predators and reintroducing herbivores to the ecosystems to feed on harmful algae that grow on the coral.\n\nIn 2004, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] requested the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) to place elkhorn coral on the endangered species list. In 2005, NMFS decided elkhorn coral qualified as an endangered species under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]]. On May 4, 2006, elkhorn coral and [[staghorn coral]] (''A. cervicornis'') were officially placed on the [[Endangered Species List]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Acropora}}\n*[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/invertebrates/elkhorn.htm NOAA Fisheries Species Directory - Elkhorn Coral (''Acropora palmata'')]\n\n{{Corals}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q163614}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elkhorn coral}}\n[[Category:Acroporidae]]\n[[Category:Corals described in 1816]]\n[[Category:ESA threatened species]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=December 2009}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| image = Elkhorn_coral.jpg\n| status = CR\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| taxon = Acropora palmata\n| authority = (Lamarck, 1816)<ref>{{cite WoRMS|author=WoRMS|year=2010|title=''Acropora palmata'' (Lamarck, 1816)|id=288227|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n| synonyms = {{hidden begin|title = List}} \n* ''Acropora alces'' <small>(Dana, 1846)</small> \n* ''Acropora flabellum'' <small>(Lamarck, 1816)</small> \n* ''Isopora muricata palmata'' <small>(Lamarck, 1816)</small>\n* ''Madrepora muricata palmata'' <small>Lamarck, 1816</small>\n* ''Madrepora alces'' <small>Dana, 1846</small>\n* ''Madrepora cornuta'' <small>Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1860</small>\n* ''Madrepora flabellum'' <small>Lamarck, 1816</small>\n* ''Madrepora palmata'' <small>Lamarck, 1816</small>\n* ''Madrepora perampla'' <small>Horn, 1861</small>\n* ''Madrepora thomassiana'' <small>Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1860</small>\n{{hidden end}}\n}}\n\n'''Elkhorn coral''' (''Acropora palmata'') Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) is an important reef-building coral in the Caribbean. The species has a complex structure with many branches which resemble that of elk antlers, hence the common name. The branching structure creates habitat and shelter for many other reef species. Elkhorn corals are known to both grow quickly with an average growth rate of 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) per year as well as reproduce quickly.

The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary has served as a protected region for the area\u2019s coral species, and has also developed plans for the protection and restoration of elkhorn coral. Restoration efforts have included attempts to reattach coral fragments that were broken off during hurricanes or by ships. Attempts to reattach coral fragments have also occurred in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]], but all have had limited success.\n\nAttempts are also being made to conserve the coral by culturing coral fragments. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], and [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] all are having limited success with coral nurseries in the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA]]) has developed and tested several ecological methods to restore this coral, including removing coral predators and reintroducing herbivores to the ecosystems to feed on harmful algae that grow on the coral.\n\nIn 2004, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] requested the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) to place elkhorn coral on the endangered species list. In 2005, NMFS decided elkhorn coral qualified as an endangered species under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]]. On May 4, 2006, elkhorn coral and [[staghorn coral]] (''A. cervicornis'') were officially placed on the [[Endangered Species List]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Acropora}}\n*[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/invertebrates/elkhorn.htm NOAA Fisheries Species Directory - Elkhorn Coral (''Acropora palmata'')]\n\n{{Corals}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q163614}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elkhorn coral}}\n[[Category:Acroporidae]]\n[[Category:Corals described in 1816]]\n[[Category:ESA threatened species]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkhorn_coral"}
