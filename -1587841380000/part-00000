A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|pages=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter.

Thus, as neighboring empires began to rise, the Phoenicians increasingly fell under the sway of foreign rulers, who to varying degrees circumscribed their autonomy.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe Assyrian conquest of Phoenicia began with King [[Shalmaneser III]], who rose to power in 858 BCE and began a series of campaigns against neighboring states. The Phoenician city states fell under his rule over a period of three years, being forced to pay heavy tribute in money, goods, and natural resources.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the Phoenicians were not annexed outright\u2014they remained in a state of vassalage, subordinate to the Assyrians but allowed a certain degree of autonomy. Relative to other conquered peoples in the empire, the Phoenicians were treated relatively well, due both to a history of otherwise amicable relations and to their importance as a source of income and even diplomacy for the expanding Assyrians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the death of Shalmaneser III in 824 BCE, the Phoenicians maintained their quasi-independence, as succeeding rulers did not wish to meddle in their internal affairs and deprive their empire of a key source of capital. This changed in 744 BCE. with the ascension of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], who sought to forcefully incorporate surrounding territories rather than keep them subordinate. By 738 BCE., most of the Levant, including northern Phoenicia, were annexed and fell directly under Assyrian administration; only Tyre and Byblos, the most powerful of the city states, remained as tributary states outside of direct control. \n\nWithin years Tyre and Byblos rebelled. Tiglath-Pileser III quickly subdued both cities and imposed heavier tribute. After several years, Tyre rebelled again, this time allying with its erstwhile rival Sidon. After two to three years, [[Sargon II]] (722-705 BCE) successfully besieged Tyre in 721 BCE and crushed the alliance. In 701 BCE, his son and successor [[Sennacherib]] suppressed further rebellions across the region, reportedly deporting most of Tyre's population to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. During the seventh century BCE, Sidon rebelled and was completely destroyed by Esarhaddon (681-668 BCE), who enslaved its inhabitants and built a new city on its ruins. \n\nWhile the Phoenicians endured unprecedented repression and conflict, by the end of the seventh century BCE., the Assyrians had been weakened by successive revolts throughout their empire, which made led to their destruction by the Iranian [[Median empire|Median Empire]].\n\n==== Babylonian rule (605\u2013538 BCE) ====\n{{main|Phoenicia under Babylonian rule}}\nThe Babylonians, formerly vassals of the Assyrians, took advantage of the empire's collapse and rebelled, quickly establishing the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in its place. The decisive battle of [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]] in northern Syria ended the historic hegemony of the Assyrians and their Egyptian allies over the Near East. While Babylonian rule over Phoenicia was brief, it hastened the precipitous decline that began under the Assyrians. Phoenician cities revolted several times throughout the reigns of the first Babylonian king, [[Nabopolassar]] (626\u2013605 BCE), and his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (c. 605\u2013c. 562 BCE). The latter's tenure witnessed several regional rebellions, especially in the Levant. After suppressing a revolt in Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar besieged the rebellious Tyre, which resisted for thirteen years from 587 to 574 BCE. The city ultimately capitulated under \"favorable terms\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon|title=Lebanon - Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Babylonian period, Tyre briefly became \"a republic headed by elective magistrates\",<ref name=\":16\" /> adopting a system of government consisting of a pair of judges, known as ''sufetes'', who were chosen from the most powerful noble families and served short terms.<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n=== Persian period (539\u2013332 BCE) ===\n{{Main|Achaemenid Phoenicia}}Following over three centuries vassalage and domination by their Mesopotamian neighbors, the Phoenician city states had generally managed to remain relatively independent and prosperous.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nevertheless, the conquests of the late Iron Age took their toll and left the Phoenicians politically and economically weakened.

This process was typically implemented through the founding of new cities (most notably Alexandria in Egypt), the settlement of a Greek urban elite, and the alteration of native place names to Greek.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nHowever, the Phoenicians were once again an outlier within an empire: there was evidently no \"organised, deliberate effort of Hellenisation in Phoenicia\", and with one or two minor exceptions, all Phoenician city states retained their native names, while Greek settlement and administration appears to have been limited.<ref name=\":9\" /> This is despite the fact that adjacent areas had been Hellenized, as had peripheral territories like the [[Caucasus]] and [[Bactria]].\n\nPhoenicians continued to maintain cultural and commercial links with their western counterparts after Alexander's conquest. [[Polybius]] recounts how the Seleucid king [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius I]] escaped from Rome by boarding a Carthaginian ship in route to deliver goods to Tyre.<ref>Fergus Milla, ''The Phoenician Cities: A Case-Study of Hellenisation,'' University of North Carolina Press (2006), '''pp. 36-37''', www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9780807876657_millar.8</ref> An inscription in Malta, made between the second and third centuries BCE, was dedicated to Herakles/Melqart in both Phoenician and Greek.

There is nowhere where it appears more vividly before us than in Herodian\u2019s description of the cult of Elagabal at Emesa; what is significant is that Herodian thought that \u2018\u2018Elagabal\u2019\u2019 was a Phoenician name and that Julia Maesa was \u2018\"by origin a Phoinissa\"\"</ref> The adaptation to Macedonian rule was likely aided by the Phoenician's historical ties with the Greeks, with whom they shared some mythologies; the two peoples were even sometimes considered \"relatives\".<ref>Millar, p. 50: Secondly, and more important, when the Phoenicians began to explore the storehouse of Greek culture, they could find, among other things, themselves, already credited with creative roles\u2014not all of which, as it happens, were purely legendary. If some aspects were just legend, like the story of Kadmos, what is clear is that the Phoenicians adopted it (perhaps, like the legend of Aeneas in Italy, very early) and made it their own. In doing so they acquired both an extra past and a reinforcement of their historical identity; and they also simultaneously gained acceptance as being in some sense Greeks</ref> \n\nAlexander's empire collapsed soon after his death in 323 BCE, dissolving into several rival kingdoms ruled by his generals, relatives, or friends (''[[diadochi]]''). The Phoenicians came under the control of the largest and most powerful of these successors, the [[Seleucids]]. The Phoenician homeland was repeatedly contested by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt]] during the forty year [[Syrian Wars]], coming under Ptolemaic rule in the third century BCE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon|title=Lebanon - Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The Seleucids reclaimed the area the following century, holding it until the mid-first century BCE. The Phoenicians were evidently allowed a considerable degree of autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon|title=Lebanon - Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Seleucid Dynastic Wars]] (157-63 BCE), the Phoenician cities were fought over by the warring factions of the royal family. The empire, which once stretched from the Aegean Sea to Pakistan, was reduced to a rump state comprising portions of the Levant and southeast Anatolia. Little is known of the state of Phoenicia during this time, but the Seleucid Kingdom was severely weakened and existed solely as a useful buffer between the Romans and their eastern rivals. The rise of Rome as a Mediterranean power, after centuries Phoenician decline, led to the first major challenge to Phoenician supremacy over the see in a millennium.\n\n=== The Punic Wars and Roman Rule ===\nWhile the Phoenician motherland was enduring a succession of foreign invasions, its settlement of Carthage was flourishing in northwest Africa, eventually becoming the only major continuation of Phoenician civilization and culture. Founded in the ninth century BCE as a colony of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Carthage became an independent city state around 650 BCE and soon rose to become a major power, exercising political [[hegemony]] over other Phoenician settlements throughout the [[western Mediterranean]]. \n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC.jpg|thumb|316x316px|The state of the western Mediterranean prior to the [[First Punic War]] in 264 B.C.]]\nBeginning in the fifth century BCE, while Phoenicia was under Babylonian rule, Carthage became the principal commercial center of the western Mediterranean and one of two hegemonic powers in the whole Mediterranean, rivaled only by Rome. Although it developed a distinct identity and culture, sometimes described as [[Punics|''Punic'']] (from the [[Latin]] ''poenus'' and ''punicus''), the Carthaginians still acknowledged their Phoenician heritage and maintained many of the same customs, practices, and religious traditions, albeit with some localized changes; their [[Punic language]] was a dialect of Phoenician. Indeed, the term Punic was used by the Romans, and now by modern scholars, to refer to Phoenicians of the western Mediterranean.\n\nCarthage oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nThe Seleucid Kingdom, including Phoenicia, was seized by [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] in 82 BCE, prompting Roman general [[Lucullus]] to intervene and conquer the territory in 62 BCE. In 65&nbsp;BCE, [[Pompey]] finally incorporated the territory as part of the [[Roman Syria|Roman province of Syria]]. Phoenicia became a [[Phoenice (Roman province)|separate province]] around the third century C.E., with the Phoenicians lacking the autonomy and cultural continuity that had been accorded by previous powers. \n\nWhile the annihilation of Carthage and absorption of the Levant put an end to Phoenician civilization, vestiges of the Phoenicians still remained, particularly their language. In the former motherland, it appeared to have persisted until roughly the ninth century.<ref>A. A. Caruana, ''Report on the Ph\u0153nician and Roman Antiquities in the Group of the Islands of Malta''. U.S. Government Printing Office (1852), '''p. 50.'''</ref> In the western Mediterranean, Punic culture survived in Sardinia at least 400 years after the Roman conquest, with the language still spoken and written.<ref name=\":9\" /> In the former Carthaginian heartland of Africa, Punic could be written until the second or third centuries (albeit in Roman and Greek script) and remained spoken among commoners at least until the end of the fourth century.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Phoenicians were [[Semitic people|Semites]],<ref name=\":5\" /> specifically an offshoot of the [[Canaanites]], an ancient group of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic-speaking peoples]] that emerged at least in the second millennium BCE. Though they would often remain know by outsides as Canaanites, and continued to identify as such, the Phoenicians became a distinct people some time in the Late Bronze Age, between the 14th and 13th centuries.<ref>Sanford Holst, \"Origin of the Phoenicians: Interactions in the Early Mediterranean Region,\" a paper presented at Queen Mary College, London, England, on June 29, 2008.</ref> Phoenician identity was not mutually exclusively with Canaanite identity, since the former was a subgroup of the latter. \n\nCenturies of largely peaceful relations between Phoenicians and various groups across the ancient world suggest their demographic makeup may have been cosmopolitan and variable, especially when compared to their mostly homogenous Greek and Egyptian neighbors. A 2018 study of mitochondrial lineages in Sardinia concluded that the Phoenicians were \"inclusive, multicultural and featured significant female mobility\", with evidence that indigenous Sardinians integrated \"peacefully and permanently\" with Phoenicians settlers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/ancient-phoenician-life-was-mixed-and-multicultural|title=Ancient Phoenician life was mixed and multicultural|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The study also found evidence suggesting that Europeans may have settled in the Phoenician city states. \n\nThe Phoenician settlement of Carthage, located in modern day Tunisia, grew into a multi-ethnic empire that spanned North Africa, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, the Baleric Islands, and southern Iberia. The extent to which non-Phoenicians were integrated into Carthaginian society, including through inter-marriage, is unknown. However, the Carthaginian military was documented to contain a wide variety of ethnic groups, including Berbers, Celts, and indigenous Iberians. \n\n=== Genetic studies ===\n{{History of Lebanon (ancient)}}{{History of Syria}}\n\nA study led by [[Pierre Zalloua]] claimed that six subclades of [[Haplogroup J-M172]] (J2)\u2014thought to have originated between the [[Caucasus Mountains]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]\u2014were of a \"Phoenician signature\" and present amongst the male populations of the \"coastal Lebanese Phoenician Heartland\" and wider Levant (the \"Phoenician Periphery\"), followed by other areas of historic Phoenician settlement, spanning Cyprus through to Morocco.<ref group=\"Note\">The full list includes \"Cyprus and South Turkey; then Crete; then Malta and East Sicily; then South Sardinia, Ibiza, and Southern Spain; and, finally, Coastal Tunisia and cities like Tingris [sic] in Morocco.\" Samples from other areas with significant Phoenician settlements, such as Libya and southern France, could not be included.</ref> This deliberate sequential sampling was an attempt to develop a methodology to link the documented historical expansion of a population with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns.

As needed, the Phoenicians could substitute expensive materials with cheaper and more accessible kinds, such as carved bone instead of ivory or colored glass instead of precious stones.\n\n[[Book of Ezekiel|The Book of Ezekiel]], written in the late sixth century BCE, details how Phoenician wares were exchanged for a variety of goods, including \"wheat, oil, and livestock and precious commodities, such as silver, iron, tin, lead, ivory, and ebony...\"<ref name=\":42\" />[[File:Contemporary portrayal of a toga picta.jpg|thumb|263x263px|An [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tomb (c. 350&nbsp;B.C.) depicting a man wearing in an all-purple ''[[toga picta]].'']]\n\n==== Tyrian purple ====\nThe most famed and coveted of Phoenician goods were fabrics and textiles dyed with [[Tyrian purple]] (named after the major Phoenician city state of Tyre), which formed a major part of Phoenician wealth. The name ''Phoenicia'' may have derived from the Greek root word for \"purple,\" indicating the extent to which it was the Phoenician's most sought after trading good. The violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. Phoenicians may have discovered the dye as early as 1750 BCE.<ref>St. Clair, Kassia (2016). ''The Secret Lives of Colour''. London: John Murray. p. 162\u2013164.</ref> [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]].  \n\nAccording to contemporaneous accounts by neighboring civilizations, Tyrian purple was highly prized because of its resistance to weathering and sunlight, which only made it brighter. The Phoenician's exclusive command over the production and trade of the dye, combined with the labor intensive extraction process, made it very expensive. Tyrian purple subsequently became associated with the upper classes and soon became a [[status symbol]] in several civilizations, most notably among the Romans. Assyrian records of tribute from the Phoenicians include \"garments of brightly colored stuff\" that most likely included Tyrian purple.<ref name=\":42\" /> While the designs, ornamentation, and embroidery used in Phoenician textiles were apparently well regarded, the techniques and specific descriptions are unknown.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== Mining ====\nThe Phoenicians most likely learned mining techniques from the Egyptians.<ref name=\":18\">\"History of Phoenicia by George Rawlinson\", Chapter X - Mining, ''www.gutenberg.org,'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010 www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010]</ref> Mining operations in the Phoenician homeland were limited, since iron was the only metal of any worth. Rawlinson believed that a major motivation for their initial expeditions was to find sources of mineral wealth.<ref name=\":18\" /> The first large scale mining operations probably occured in Cyprus, which was the Phoenician's earliest and closest overseas territory to have mineral wealth, principally copper. Sardinia may have been colonized almost exclusively for its mineral resources; Phoenician settlements were concentrated in the southern and southwestern parts of the island, which were rich in copper and lead, and their cities were positioned relatively close to these sources. Piles of [[Scoria|scorae]] and copper ingots, which appear to predate the subsequent Roman occupation, suggest the Phoenicians both mined and processed metals on the island.<ref name=\":18\" /> The Iberian Peninsula, which saw significant Phoenician settlement, was known for being the richest source of numerous metals in antiquity, including gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead.<ref name=\":18\" /> The output of these metals during the Phoenicians and Carthaginian occupation strongly implied large scale mining operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010|title=History of Phoenicia by George Rawlinson|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> There is documentation that the Carthaginians relied on slave labor for mining, though it is unknown if the Phoenicians as a whole did so.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe Phoenician homeland lacked sufficient arable land to support large scale agriculture. The most notable agricultural product was wine (known as ''cherem''), which the Phoenicians helped propagate across the Mediterranean. The [[Vitis vinifera|common grape vine]] may have been domesticated by the Phoenicians or Canaanites, although it most likely arrived from [[Transcaucasia]] (modern Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan) via [[Mesopotamia]] or [[Black Sea]] trade routes. Vines grew readily in the coastal Levant, and the wines of [[Byblos]] were exported to Egypt as early as the [[Old Kingdom]] period (2686\u20132134 BCE). The wines of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] were popular in the ancient Mediterranean, as evidenced by the discovery of shipwrecks still full of wine.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/ships-0714.html MIT technology helps map ancient Phoenician shipwrecks] MIT press release</ref> As the first great traders of wine, the Phoenicians apparently developed techniques to preserve it; to prevent oxidation, vessels were sealed with a layer of olive oil, pinewood, and resin, which may have inspired the [[Greeks|Greek]] taste for [[retsina]]. \n\nWine played an important part in [[Phoenician religion]], and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Dionysus]] (and by extension the Roman god Bacchus) may have originated in the wine rituals of Canaan. The great temple at Baalbek has many depictions of vines and wine drinking,<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=2&id=296 Baalbec - Ruins of the Temple of Bacchus] Liverpool Museums</ref><ref>[http://www.medinaarts.com/JHLCat08.htm Roberts prints of Baalbek] Medina Arts</ref> which could have influenced [[Jewish]] [[Passover (Jewish holiday)|Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] and the [[Christianity and alcohol|Christian Eucharist]]. Wine also featured heavily in [[Ugarit#Ugaritic literature|Ugaritic poetry]], such as the ''Rapiuma'':<blockquote>Day long they pour the wine, ... must-wine, fit for rulers. Wine, sweet and abundant, Select wine... The choice wine of Lebanon, Most nurtured by El ...<ref>Robert Sechrist, ''Planet of the Grapes: A Geography of Wine'', p. 5.</ref></blockquote>The Phoenicians may also have taught [[winemaking]] to some of their trading partners. The ancient Iberians began producing wine from local grape varieties following their encounter with the Phoenicians. Iberian cultivars subsequently formed the basis of most western European wine.<ref>Robert Sechrist, ''Planet of the Grapes: A Geography of Wine'', p. 6-7.</ref>\n\nCarthage, which had more abundant and fertile land than other Phoenician settlements, practiced highly advanced and productive agriculture. Homer described Carthage as capable of  \"yielding any crop in due season \u2026 where the vine would never wither, and there is plenty of land level enough for the plough, where farmers could count on cutting a deep crop at every harvest time, for the soil below the surface is exceeding rich. Also, it has a safe harbor\u2026 at the head of the which, there is a stream of fresh water, running out of a cave in a grove of poplar trees.\" The Carthaginians appeared to have made good use of their land, inventing [[Rotary quern|hand-driven rotary mills]] in the sixth century BCE and horse mills in the fourth century BCE, while also adopting or improving upon [[Plough|iron ploughs]], [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], and [[Threshing board|threshing machines]]. Carthage was subsequently an agricultural powerhouse of the Mediterranean, exporting olives, nuts, honey, wheat, and various fruits and vegetables, especially figs, pears, pomegranates, grates, and dates. Livestock were also raised, particularly mules, oxen, goats, and horses. Circumstantial evidence suggests Carthage also developed [[viticulture]] and wine production before the fourth century BCE, with raisin wine (''[[passum]]'') being especially popular, even among the hostile Romans.+\n\nCarthage produced one of history's earliest [[Agronomist|agronmists]], known only as When of Carthage. Considered the \"Father of Farmng\" by the Greeks and Romans, he produced a 28-book treatise on a wide variety of agricultural topics, ranging from beekeeping to how to deterine the heath of cattle. His work was so well regarded that wome conquered and destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, the Roman Senate decreed that s famous treatise on agriculture be translated into Latin. Unfortunately, Mago's original work is lost, and only fragments remain of its translation.\n\n=== Phoenician ships ===\nAs a predominately maritime people, the Phoenicians were among the earliest and most influential pioneers in shipbuilding and design. Naval historian [[Richard Woodman]] described them as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the inventors of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"<ref>Richard Woodman, The History of the Ship (New York: Lyons Press, 1987), 16.</ref>\n[[File:Phoenician ship.jpg|thumb|Phoenician ship carved on the face of a sarcophagus (second century A.D.)]]\nAs early as 1200 BCE, the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. During the Bronze Age, they developed the [[keel]], the bottom-most longitudinal structural element on a ship, which was a significant advancement over the more common [[Dugout canoe|dugout]] vessels, which were limited in size, durability, maneuverability. Pegged [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joints were developed to make Phoenician ships sturdier, and proved effective enough to serve as a standard template across the Mediterranean until late into the Roman Empire.\n\nOther key ship components, such as the [[Brail|brailed rig sail]], which allowed for greater maneuverability, and the [[crow's nest]], which provided a vital lookout point, most likely originated in the Levant. Around 700 BCE, the Phoenicians were possibly the first to introduce the ''[[bireme]]'', a large [[galley]] that had two tiers of oars staggered on either side of the vessel, which allowed for significantly greater propulsion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/galley-ship|title=Galley {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> An Assyrian account describes Phoenicians quickly evading capture with these ships.<ref>Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh', first series, pl. 71; 'Nineveh and its Remains', l.s.c.</ref> The Carthaginians, who descended from the Phoenicians, had become a major power in the western Mediterranean largely because of their ability to quickly mass produce ships; parts were labeled with the Punic alphabet, indicating an industrial method of serial production.<ref>Piero Bartoloni, \u201cShips and Navigation,\u201d in The Phoenicians, ed. Sabatino Moscati (New York: Abbeville, 1988), p 76.</ref>\n\n[[File:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|[[Assyria]]n warship, probably built by Phoenicians, with two rows of oars, in a relief from [[Nineveh]] (c. 700 B.C.)]]In addition to ships, the Phoenicians developed or contributed several other maritime inventions. The [[amphora]], a type of container used for both dry and liquid gods, was an ancient Phoenician invention that became a standardized measurement of volume for close to two thousand years. The remnants of self-cleaning artificial harbors have been discovered in Sidon, Tyre, Atlit, and Acre.<ref>Arad Haggi, \u201cReport on Underwater Excavation at the Phoenician Harbour, Atlit, Israel,\u201d International Journal of Nautical Archeology 39 (2010): 283.</ref> The Phoenicians relied on [[celestial navigation]], and most likely discovered Polaris (the North Star), which enabled nighttime sailing and shorter open-sea routes; the Greeks subsequently called Polaris the \"Phoenician Star.\" The wind rose, a precursor to the compass rose, was apparently of Phoenician, or at least Levantine, origin. The first example of [[admiralty law]] also appears in the Levant.<ref>Shelley Wachsmann, Seagoing Ships & Seamanship in the Bronze Age Levant (College Station, TX: Texas A & M University Press, 1998), 300, 51, 323-325, 332.</ref> The Phoenicians continued to contribute to cartography into the Iron Age.<ref>Mark Woolmer, Ancient Phoenicia: An Introduction (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2011), p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: {{lang|grc-Latn|Galloi}} (tubs) and {{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}} (horses). The names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the seventh and eighth centuries BCE, which were tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and had horse heads on both ends. (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that the ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]], equated with the Semitic-Levantine god [[Yam (god)|Yam]]. In ''[[Oeconomicus]],'' Greek historian and philosopher [[Xenophon]], through the Greek character Ischomachus, describes in great detail the sophistication and craftsmanship of Phoenician ships:<blockquote>I think that the best and most perfect arrangement of things that I ever saw was when I went to look at the great Phoenician sailing-vessel; for I saw the largest amount of naval tackling separately disposed in the smallest stowage possible. For a ship, as you well know, is brought to anchor, and again got under way, by a vast number of wooden implements and of ropes and sails the sea by means of a quantity of rigging, and is armed with a number of contrivances against hostile vessels, and carries about with it a large supply of weapons for the crew, and, besides, has all the utensils that a man keeps in his dwelling-house, for each of the messes. In addition, it is laden with a quantity of merchandise which the owner carries with him for his own profit. Now all the things which I have mentioned lay in a space not much bigger than a room which would conveniently hold ten beds. And I remarked that they severally lay in a way that they did not obstruct one another, and did not require anyone to search for them; and yet they were neither placed at random, nor entangled one with another, so as to consume time when they were suddenly wanted for use. Also, I found the captain's assistant, who is called 'the look-out man,' so well acquainted with the position of all the articles, and with the number of them, that even when at a distance he could tell where everything lay, and how many there were of each sort, just as anyone who has learnt to read can tell the number of letters in the name of Socrates and the proper place for each of them. Moreover, I saw this man, in his leisure moments, examining and testing everything that a vessel needs when at sea; so, as I was surprised, I asked him what he was about, whereupon he replied--'Stranger, I am looking to see, in case anything should happen, how everything is arranged in the ship, and whether anything is wanting, or is inconveniently situated; for when a storm arises at sea, it is not possible either to look for what is wanting, or to put to right what is arranged awkwardly.<ref>George Rawlinson, ''History of the Phoenician Civilization,'' citing Xen.

The leading city states were Sur ([[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]), Sydon ([[Sidon]]), and Jbail (modern [[Byblos]], one of the oldest sites of civilization). Throughout Phoenician history, at least one of these cities was politically and economically dominant at any given time. Rivalries were common, but open warfare less so. Although they never appeared to have joined in a formal confederation, as seen among the Greek city states, informal cooperation seemed common. \n\nNumerous others cities existed in the Levant alone, many probably unknown, including Berut (modern [[Beirut]]) Ampi, Amia, Arqa, [[Baalbek]], Botrys, Sarepta and [[Tripoli]]. From the late tenth century BCE, the Phoenician's expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies beyond Lebanon and throughout the Mediterranean. Phoenician settlement was especially concentrated in Cyprus, Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, northwest Africa, the Balearic Islands, and southern Iberia. Canaanite deities like [[Baal]] and [['Ashtart|Astarte]] were being worshiped from Cyprus and Sicily to Spain and Portugal, most notably at Carthage (''{{lang|phn|Qart Hada\u0161t}}'') in modern Tunisia.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = \n| width = 330\n| image1 = Griechischen und ph\u00f6nizischen Kolonien.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Carthage Holdings.png\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left, map of Phoenician (in yellow) and Greek colonies around 8th to 6th century BC (with German legend).

However, by the early Iron Age (roughly 1300 BCE) the Phoenicians had emerged as a distinct people, with their culture, economy, and daily life being heavily centered on commerce and maritime trade. Their propensity for seafaring brought them into contact with numerous other civilizations, possibly more so than any other contemporary people, leading to a uniquely cosmopolitan society that incorporated different customs, artistic styles, and faith traditions.\n=== Politics and government ===\n[[File:King Hiram Of Tyre.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Hiram I|King Hiram I of Tyre]], located in the village of Hanawai (Hanawiya or Hanawey) in southern Lebanon.]]Despite a shared language, culture, and religion, the Phoenicians never constituted a single, cohesive political unit, and it is unknown whether they viewed themselves as a nation in the modern sense. The Phoenicians organized into city states that were fiercely independent in both domestic and foreign affairs. Formal alliances between city states were rare, and cooperation was generally informal, loosely aligned, and ad hoc. Unlike their Greek counterparts, warfare between Phoenician city states was rarer still, although rivalries did exist and coercion was sometimes employed. The relative power and influence of city states varied over time. Sidon was dominant between the 12th and 11th centuries BCE, and exercised some influence over its neighbors, but by the tenth century BCE, Tyre rose to become the most powerful city.\n\nPhoenician society was highly stratified and predominantly [[Monarchy|monarchical]], at least in its earlier stages. Hereditary kings usually governed with absolute power and had responsibilities over civic, commercial, and religious affairs. They often relied upon senior officials from the noble and merchant classes. The priesthood was a distinct class, though usually of royal lineage or from leading merchant families. The king was considered a representative of the gods and carried many obligations and duties with respect to religious processions and rituals. Priests were thus highly influential and often became intertwined with the royal family.\n\nUnlike their Greek and Egyptian counterparts, Phoenician kings did not commemorate their reign through sculptures or monuments. Their wealth, power, and accomplishments were usually conveyed through ornate sarcophaguses, like that of [[Ahiram sarcophagus|Ahiram]] of Byblos. The Phoenicians kept fairly meticulous records of their rulers in the form of tomb inscriptions, which are among the few primary sources still available. Historians have been able to determine a clear line of succession over centuries for some city-states, notably Byblos and Tyre.\n\n==== Semi-democratic government ====\nNot all Phoenician city states were absolute monarchies, and their political systems appeared to have changed and evolved with time and circumstances. British classicist [[Simon Hornblower]] notes that the Phoenicians \"had something comparable to the self-regulating city-state or ''polis'' (and) the Greek political arrangements we most admire.\"<ref>Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): '''123'''.</ref> As early as the 14th century BCE, Egyptian envoys reported that Phoenician assemblies \"might act on their own behalf\"; when the city state of Irqata declared its allegiance to the pharaoh, it did so as \"Irqata and its elders\", without reference to a king.<ref name=\":1\">Stephen Stockwell, Geopolitics, History, and International Relations , Vol. 2, No. 2 (2010), pp. 123- 135</ref> Similarly, the pharaoh is addressed by \"the citizens of Tunip,\" the \"people from Gubla (Byblos),\" and \"the men of Arwad.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> An 11th century Egyptian report found that while the king of Byblos managed trade and religious life, state affairs were handled with advice by an \"assembly\".\n\nIn the sixth century BCE, during the period of Babylonian rule, Tyre briefly adopted a system of government consisting of a pair of judges, known as sufetes, who were chosen from the most powerful noble families and served short terms.<ref name=\":10\">Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): '''128'''.</ref> One scholar characterized Tyre during this period as \"a republic headed by elective magistrates\".<ref name=\":16\">Bondi, S.F.

The importance of trade to the Phoenician economy evidently led to a gradual sharing of power between the king and assemblies of merchant families.]]\nBy the seventh century BCE, many city states had circumscribed the power of their kings, who now shared some degree of power with the merchant families and sailors who were key to the state's prosperity. Kings increasingly required the support of different stakeholders, and there is evidence that the councils and assemblies that had previously played an advisory role had accumulated some power over the state. The Greek historian Arrian reported that senior officials were sometimes called upon to govern when the king was predisposed, and accounts from other outsiders claimed that councils were the true rulers, such that they could impose their decisions on the king during emergencies. In effect, many Phoenician city states appeared to be plutocracies ruled by the wealthiest families.<ref>Aristotle (5 November 2012). ''Politics: A Treatise on Government''.

Details regarding the duties of these offices are sparse, but it is known that the governor was responsible for collecting taxes, implementing decrees, supervising judges, and ensuring the administration of law and justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> As warfare was rare among the mostly mercantile Phoenicians, the commander of the army was generally responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the city-state and its hinterlands.[[File:PhoenicianStela-4cBC-Tyre-NationalMuseumOfBeirut 03102019RomanDeckert.jpg|thumb|Stela from Tyre with Phoenician inscriptions (c. fourth century BCE). National Museum of Beirut.]]The Phoenicians had a system of courts and judges that resolved disputes and punished crimes based on a semi-codified body of law and traditional. Laws were implemented by the state and were the responsibility of the ruler and certain designated officials. Like other Levantine societies, laws were harsh and biased, reflecting the social stratification of society. The murder of a commoner was treated as less serious than of a nobleman, and the upper classes had the most rights; the wealthy often escaped punishment by paying a fine. Free men of any class could represent themselves in court and had more rights than women and children, while slaves had no rights at all. Men could often deflect punishment to their wives, children, or slaves, even having them serve his sentence in his place. Lawyers eventually emerged as a profession for those who could not plead their own case.\n\nAs in neighboring societies at the time, penalties for crimes were often severe, usually reflecting the principle of reciprocity; for example, the killing of a slave would be punished by having the offender's slave killed. Imprisonment was rare, with fines, exile, punishment, and execution were main remedies.\n\n=== Military ===\nAs with most aspects of Phoenician civilization, there are few records of their military or approach to warfare. Compared to most of their neighbors, the Phoenicians generally had little interest in conquest and were a relatively peaceful people.<ref>\u201cThey became the first to provide a link between the culture of the ancient Near East and that of the uncharted world of the West\u2026They went not for conquest as the Babylonians and Assyrians did, but for trade. Profit rather than plunder was their policy.\u201d James B. Pritchard, introduction to The Sea Traders, by Maitland A. Edey (New York: Time-Life Books, 1974), '''7.'''</ref> The wealth and prosperity of all their city states rested on foreign trade, which required good relations and a certain degree of mutual trust. They also lacked the territory and agricultural base to support a population large enough for anything other than city defense; each city had an army commander in charge of a defensive garrison, but the specifics of the role, or of city defense, are unknown.\n\nMore is known about the [[military of Carthage]], though it is uncertain whether the Carthaginian military was reflective of general Phoenician practice, since they were the only Phoenician polity to establish a sprawling, multi-ethnic empire.<ref>P.

Retrieved 22 February 2013.</ref> Carthage's military traditions generally reflected Phoenician roots combined with native North African and Greek influences. Like other Phoenicians, the Carthaginians were largely a maritime and trading power, and did not maintain a large, permanent, standing army. [[Polybius]] wrote that they were naturally \"superior at sea both in efficiency and equipment, because seamanship has long been their national craft\" and they were \"more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people\"<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=Polybius \u2022 Histories \u2014 Book\u00a06|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> By contrast, he claims the Carthaginian infantry was \"neglected\" and its cavalry given \"slight attention\".<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAt its peak, Carthage's navy comprised 300 to 350 warships. In the First Punic War, the Romans, who previously lacked experience in naval warfare, persevered partly by reverse-engineering captured Carthaginian ships. In the Third Punic War, Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, who now faced a larger Roman force: They augmented their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). This allowed them to resist far longer despite being outnumbered.\n\nAs far as land warfare, Livy claims that Carthage had at least 40,000 professional soldiers prior to the Third Punic War. Otherwise, it relied heavily on a multinational force of foreign mercenaries and subjects, including ethnic [[Berbers|Libyans]] and [[Numidians]] from its surrounding territory, and [[Celts]], [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]], [[Iberians]] from its overseas territories. Its cavalry force was formidable, composed of light [[Numidian cavalry]] and mounted [[North African elephant|North African elephants]]. [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]], armed with straps of cloth to toss small stones at high speeds, were also fielded.\n\nUnlike its army, the Carthaginian navy was drawn mostly from Phoenician citizenry. Perhaps reflecting historic Phoenician affinity for the sea, the navy was considered a stable and prestigious profession that offered financial security. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, as poor and unemployed citizens could find an outlet for upward mobility. The reputation and quality of the Carthaginian navy, conceded even by their Roman rivals, implies that their sailors were well trained even during peacetime.\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Phoenician language|Phoenician alphabet|Alphabet}}\nThe [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician language]] is classified in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] subgroup of Northwest [[Semitic languages|Semitic]].

The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\n[[File:Tunisise Carthage Tophet Salambo 03.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Tophet funerary [[stele]], showing (below moon and sun) a symbol of Tanit, queen goddess of Carthage]]\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

The Phoenicians served as intermediaries between the disparate civilizations that spanned the Mediterranean and Near East, facilitating the exchange of not only goods, but knowledge, art, and religious traditions.

Though initially vassals of Egypt during the Bronze Age, in the centuries following the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Phoenicians usually maintained relatively amicable relations with the Egyptians, though this varied by dynasty. This is best illustrated by the existence of a Phoenician settlement and temple in the capital city of Memphis, which included a temple, as the Egyptians were generally intolerant of foreigners.<ref>Rawlinson, \"It is most remarkable that the Egyptians, intolerant as they usually were of strangers, should have allowed the Phoenicians to settle in their southern capital, Memphis, and to build a temple and inhabit a quarter there.\" ''History of the Phoenicians,'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2H_4_0021 www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2H_4_0021]</ref> The Phoenicians were also heavily influenced by Egyptian culture, particularly with respect to artistic conventions and motifs.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Relations with the Greeks ===\nPhoenicia's ties with the Greece appeared to have began with the Minoan civilization on Crete (1950-1450 BCE), which together with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] (1600\u20131100 BCE) is considered the progenitor of classical Greece.

In both Phoenician and Greek mythologies, [[Cadmus]] is a Phoenician prince, the son of king Agenor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Herodotus credits Cadmus for bringing the Phoenician alphabet to Greece{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=112}} approximately sixteen hundred years before Herodotus' time, or around 2000 BCE,{{sfn|Herodotus, The Histories|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D4 II.145.4] }} as he attested:\n{{quote|text=These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks.

Heracles was inspired by the Phoenician god [[Melqart]], sometimes called the Tyrian Heracles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Melqart|title=Melqart {{!}} Phoenician deity|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> who was equally revered by both peoples. An inscription in Malta, made by Tyrians between the second and third centuries BCE, was dedicated to Herakles/Melqart in both Phoenician and Greek. [[File:Stela with Melqart on his lion.JPG|thumb|Stela from [[Amrit]] with [[Melqart]] on his lion (c. 550 BCE). The patron god of Tyre, and a major deity in the Phoenician and Punic religions, he was typically identified by the Greeks as Heracles and was even called the \"Tyrian Heracles\"\"]]Another prominent Phoenician is [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]], one of the most famous consorts of Zeus and the mother of [[Basileus|King]] [[Minos]] of [[Crete]], sometimes described as the sister of Cadmus. They have several other siblings that played prominent roles in Greek mythology, and in some incarnations are related to Poseidon. The integration of Phoenician figures into Greek mythology, often in a heroic or privileged position, suggests some degree of Greek affinity towards Phoenicians.\n\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \"Lord of the Sea\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \"Poseidon\u2013Neptune\" figure of Phoenician religion. While such a figure is attested by authorities and inscriptions as being revered by merchants and sailors, a singular name has yet to be found.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ribichini |first=S. |year=1988 |chapter=Beliefs and Religious Life |editor=Sabatino Moscati |title=The Phoenicians |pp=104\u201325 |location=Milan |publisher=Gruppo Editoriale Fabbri }}</ref> However, there are names for sea gods from individual city states. Yamm is the god of the sea of [[Ugarit]], an ancient city state north to Phoenicia. Some scholars have identified Yamm with Poseidon, although he has also been identified with [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgarten|first=A.I.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BM8UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&dq=Poseidon+Phoenician+Yamm#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos: A Commentary|publisher=Brill|year=1981|isbn=978-90-04-06369-3|page=207}}</ref> Yamm is in cosmic conflict with Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth who is often associated with Zeus. While Yamm is nominally the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos,<ref>Habel, N.C. 1964. ''Yahweh Versus Baal: A Conflict of Religious Cultures''. New York: Bookman Associates</ref> in direct opposition to the order represented by Baal. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power, in some versions killing him, while in others, the goddess Athtart intervenes to save Yamm but advise that he remain in his own province for being defeated. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot, whose Greek equivalent, Hades, is the brother of Poseidon.<ref>Ringgren, H. 1917. ''Religions of the Ancient Near East''. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press</ref> \n\n==== Greek accounts and attitudes ====\nThe Greeks had varying dispositions to the Phoenicians, generally expressing an ambivalence for their merchantlistic culture. In his [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']], Greek philosopher [[Plato]] contends that the love of money is a tendency of the soul found amongst Phoenicians and Egyptians, which distinguishes them from the Greeks who tend towards the love of knowledge.<ref>Plato, ''Republic'', IV (435e\u2013436a)</ref> In his ''Laws'', he asserts that this love of money has led the Phoenicians and Egyptians to develop skills in cunning and trickery ([[wikt:\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1]]) rather than wisdom ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1]]}}).<ref>Plato Laws V (747c)</ref>\n\nSuch a view is expressed in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', where the Phoenicians are described as skilled sailors and artisans, but also \"greedy knaves\".<ref>Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity,'' '''p. 325.'''\n\n<br /></ref> By contrast, the ''Iliad'' conveys apparent Greek affinity for Phoenician craftsmanship. [[Hecuba]], in seeking her best gown as a sacrifice to the goddess [[Athena]], chooses one embroidered by \"Sidonian\" women; Achilles offers the fastest man in a race a Sidonian bowl as a prize.<ref name=\":11\" /> Xenophon speaks favorably about the sophistication and orderliness of Phoenician ships, while Aristotle regards Carthage as a model for a merit based society: \"Carthage, as is clear, supplied the principal criterion by which to measure success.\"<ref>Eric S. Gruen, Rethinking the Other in Antiquity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011), 199-120.</ref>\n\nIn his ''Histories'', Herodotus gives the Persian and Greek accounts of a series of kidnappings that led to the Trojan War. While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians [[Raptio|kidnapped]] a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] from [[Argos]]. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall, the Persians considered the Greeks to be their enemy.{{sfn|Herodotus, The History|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html I.1.1\u20135]}}\n\nNotwithstanding these mixed views, centuries of otherwise amicable cultural and commercial ties between the Phoenicians and Greeks\u2014with commonalities such as a maritime tradition, self governing city states, and mythological figures\u2014meant the two peoples were sometimes regarded as \"relatives\".<ref>Millar, p. 50: Secondly, and more important, when the Phoenicians began to explore the storehouse of Greek culture, they could find, among other things, themselves, already credited with creative roles\u2014not all of which, as it happens, were purely legendary. If some aspects were just legend, like the story of Kadmos, what is clear is that the Phoenicians adopted it (perhaps, like the legend of Aeneas in Italy, very early) and made it their own. In doing so they acquired both an extra past and a reinforcement of their historical identity; and they also simultaneously gained acceptance as being in some sense Greeks</ref> \n\n=== Relations with the Israelites ===\nDespite being notoriously belligerent towards their neighbors, the Israelites apparently took exception to the Phoenicians, especially those of Tyre. King Hiram of Tyre is credited with helping build Solomon's Temple, providing materials and skilled craftsmen; in exchange, Solomon paid tribute and even ceded some territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hiram-king-of-Tyre|title=Hiram {{!}} king of Tyre|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> As Rawlinson notes, good relations the Jewish Bible describes many more examples of cordial if not warm relations between the peoples: <blockquote>Hiram\u2019s friendly dealings with David and Solomon are well known; but the ''continued'' alliance between the Phoenicians and the Israelites has attracted less attention. Solomon took wives from Phoenicia; Ahab married the daughter of Ithobalus, king of Sidon; Phoenicia furnished timber for the second Temple; Isaiah wound up his prophecy against Tyre with a consolation; our Lord found faith in the Syro-Phoenician woman; in the days of Herod Agrippa, Tyre and Sidon still desired peace with Jud\u00e6a, \"because their country was nourished by the king\u2019s country.\"</blockquote>Such amiable relations were also remarkable given that the Phoenicians were [[Paganism|pagan]] and the Israelites were staunch monotheists. \n\n== Ancient sources ==\n\n=== In the Bible ===\n[[File:Hiram shows the planes to Solomon by J.J.

[[Books of Kings#Contents|1 Kings 5:1]] says: \"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\" [[2 Chronicles]] 2:14 says: \"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him&nbsp;...\"\n\nIn [[Masonic]] lore, [[Hiram Abiff]] is the architect of Solomon's temple and a central figure Masonic rituals and mythology.\n\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: [[Elijah]] execrated [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], the princess from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] who became a consort of King [[Ahab]] and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\n\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \"Syro-Phoenicians\", as in the [[Gospel of Mark]]: \"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\".<ref>7:26</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[Bible]]'' itself derives from Greek ''{{lang|grc|biblion}}'', which means \"book\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of ''[[Byblos]]'', the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Bible&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. \"Bible\"].

Beginning in the early 1960s, new and reexamined discoveries by scholars and archaeologists have shed more light on the Phoenicians and their contributions and achievements.<ref name=\":4\">\"Modern Phoenician studies were launched during the early 1960\u2019s by Sabatino Moscati and the Italian school. By the seventies there was an emphasis on the Phoenician expansion\" Scott, John C. (2018) \"The Phoenicians and the Formation of the Western World,\" Comparative Civilizations Review: Vol. 78 : No. 78 , Article 4.</ref><ref name=\":4\" /> \nThe most widely known legacy was their development and transmission of an [[alphabet]] throughout the Mediterranean, which formed the basis of the Greek alphabet, from which the widely used [[Latin script]] derives. The Phoenician alphabet was innovative in its \"egalitarian\" nature, providing a simple writing system that did not require a small caste of professional scribes, priests, and officials, as in Egypt or Mesopotamia.<ref name=\":5\" /> It could be written on a variety of media and was easy to learn due to its fixed nature, allowing for easier communication across classes and cultures.<ref name=\":5\" /> In addition to facilitating commercial relations\u2014and thus leading to the exchange of goods and ideas that brought prosperity to the region\u2014it has been argued that the Phoenician alphabet proved pivotal to the progress of civilization as a whole:<blockquote>The alphabetical (like the numerical) system is how societies organize information. Beyond literacy and systematization, the alphabet stimulates both abstract and rational thought through the phonetic coding and decoding process. As a result, the adoption of Phoenician letters\u2014especially in Ionia and Athens\u2014created an intellectual environment for the development of Greek, and, subsequently, Western science.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>\nAnthropologist Ralph Linton argues that the Phoenician's \"main role in the development of the Greek and other Mediterranean cultures was as intermediaries between Asia and Europe.\"<ref>Ralph Linton, The Tree of Culture (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1956), 341.</ref> This was aided by Phoenicia's location at the crossroads of the major civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia. As one of the few civilizations to emerge from the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] relatively unscathed, the Phoenicians led the way in reopening trade routes that connected the Egyptian, Greek, and Mesopotamian civilizations. As the dominant seafarers and traders well into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians maintained an unparalleled commercial network that revitalized the region and contributed to the \"civilizational development of the Mediterranean basin.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Historian [[Jerry H. Bentley]] argues that this Phoenician-led flourishing of maritime commerce also furthered the economic, social, and cultural integration of the Mediterranean, leading to unprecedented ties and exchanges between otherwise distinct civilizations.<ref>Jerry H. Bentley, \u201cSea and Ocean Basins as Frameworks for Historical Analysis,\u201d Geographical Review 89 (1999): 215-219.</ref>[[File:Phoenician ship, National Bank of Hungary, 2017 Lip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros.jpg|thumb|Phoenician ship depicted on a relief of the National Bank of Hungary. The Phoenicians remain well known for their mercantilism. |252x252px]]The Greeks and Romans eventually emulated this Phoenician model, laying the foundation of the \"Mediterranean as a single economic, political, and cultural unit.\" [[Hans G. Niemeyer]], an expert in Iron Age Phoenicia, claims the Phoenicians \"sparked Western civilization\" through their \"transfusion of Eastern goods, technologies, and ideas that, in turn, became the foundations of Greco-Roman civilization.\"<ref>Hans G. Niemeyer, \u201cThe Phoenicians and the Birth of a Multinational Mediterranean Society,\u201d in Commerce and Monetary Systems in the Ancient World, ed. Robert Rollinger and Christoph Ulf (Stuttgart: Franz Stiener Verlag, 2004), 246, 250.</ref> He also credits Phoenicia for the \"dissemination of urban civilization, in the propagation of technical innovations, in the distribution of new [aristocratic] lifestyle paradigms and \u2018modern\u2019 economics.\" The Phoenician mercantile system encouraged the division of labor and accumulation of wealth that allowed for state-building; the adoption of this model is credited for the development of states from Greece to Spain.<ref>Susan Sherratt and Andrew Sherratt, \u201cThe Growth of the Mediterranean Economy in the Early First Millennium BC,\u201d World Archeology 24 (1993): 367, 369.</ref> The Phoenician's contributions were known and acknowledged by these societies.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition to various manufactured goods and resources, Phoenicians traders imparted the West with Mesopotamian astronomical and mathematical ideas and Egyptian architectural and artistic styles. The \"[[Orientalising period|Orientalising]]\" trend later seen in [[Greek art]] is attributed to the Phoenicians, whose own artistic tradition was an amalgamation of different cultures in the Mediterranean and Near East. The forerunner of [[Ionic order]] and [[Ashlar|ashlar masonry]], which remain staples of classical architecture throughout the West, was the Proto-Aeolic capital developed by Phoenicians. Similarly, Bronze Age Phoenicians developed [[lime mortar]] from which the Greeks created true cement and Romans produced concrete.<ref>Yigal Shiloh (1979). ''The Proto-Aeolic capital and Israelite ashlar masonry''.

Dilke, Mathematics and Measurement (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 21.</ref>\nIt is possible that some Phoenician city states developed some of the earliest \"proto-democratic\" political structures in history, such as councils of elders and popular assemblies, which possibly inspired Greek city states like Athens.<ref name=\":5\">Scott, John C.

Many Lebanese continue to [[Phoenicianism|identify as Phoenicians]].]]As the earliest known people to engage in expansive maritime trade and seafaring, the Phoenicians developed numerous naval and navigational innovations that were adopted by neighboring societies. The bireme, a multi-tiered oared vessel, was created some time in the eighth century B.C. and became common throughout the Mediterranean region, eventually being evolved by the Romans. As the first people to have explored beyond the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], and first to colonise the Western Mediterranean in any significant way, the Phoenicians inspired similar maritime ventures by the Greeks and Romans. Beginning the eighth century B.C., the Greek city-states of [[Euboea]] and Corinth led the movement towards colonization by learning shipbuilding, navigational techniques, and the east-west trade routes of the Phoenicians.<ref>Richard A. Billows, Marathon (New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2010), 61-62.</ref> Following contact by the Phoenicians with mainland Italy in the tenth century BCE, the Etruscans and other [[Italic peoples]] learned the Phoenician methods of celestial navigation, weights and measures, and even finance, which centuries later were used and developed by the Romans.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nLong after the Phoenicians ceased to be an independent civilization, their descendants remained influential figures in various disciplines, and were often aware of their Phoenician roots.

Thus, as neighboring empires began to rise, the Phoenicians increasingly fell under the sway of foreign rulers, who to varying degrees circumscribed their autonomy.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe Assyrian conquest of Phoenicia began with King [[Shalmaneser III]], who rose to power in 858 BCE and began a series of campaigns against neighboring states. The Phoenician city states fell under his rule over a period of three years, being forced to pay heavy tribute in money, goods, and natural resources.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the Phoenicians were not annexed outright\u2014they remained in a state of vassalage, subordinate to the Assyrians but allowed a certain degree of autonomy. Relative to other conquered peoples in the empire, the Phoenicians were treated relatively well, due both to a history of otherwise amicable relations and to their importance as a source of income and even diplomacy for the expanding Assyrians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the death of Shalmaneser III in 824 BCE, the Phoenicians maintained their quasi-independence, as succeeding rulers did not wish to meddle in their internal affairs and deprive their empire of a key source of capital. This changed in 744 BCE. with the ascension of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], who sought to forcefully incorporate surrounding territories rather than keep them subordinate. By 738 BCE., most of the Levant, including northern Phoenicia, were annexed and fell directly under Assyrian administration; only Tyre and Byblos, the most powerful of the city states, remained as tributary states outside of direct control. \n\nWithin years Tyre and Byblos rebelled. Tiglath-Pileser III quickly subdued both cities and imposed heavier tribute. After several years, Tyre rebelled again, this time allying with its erstwhile rival Sidon. After two to three years, [[Sargon II]] (722-705 BCE) successfully besieged Tyre in 721 BCE and crushed the alliance. In 701 BCE, his son and successor [[Sennacherib]] suppressed further rebellions across the region, reportedly deporting most of Tyre's population to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. During the seventh century BCE, Sidon rebelled and was completely destroyed by Esarhaddon (681-668 BCE), who enslaved its inhabitants and built a new city on its ruins. \n\nWhile the Phoenicians endured unprecedented repression and conflict, by the end of the seventh century BCE., the Assyrians had been weakened by successive revolts throughout their empire, which made led to their destruction by the Iranian [[Median empire|Median Empire]].\n\n==== Babylonian rule (605\u2013538 BCE) ====\n{{main|Phoenicia under Babylonian rule}}\nThe Babylonians, formerly vassals of the Assyrians, took advantage of the empire's collapse and rebelled, quickly establishing the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in its place. The decisive battle of [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]] in northern Syria ended the historic hegemony of the Assyrians and their Egyptian allies over the Near East. While Babylonian rule over Phoenicia was brief, it hastened the precipitous decline that began under the Assyrians. Phoenician cities revolted several times throughout the reigns of the first Babylonian king, [[Nabopolassar]] (626\u2013605 BCE), and his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (c. 605\u2013c. 562 BCE). The latter's tenure witnessed several regional rebellions, especially in the Levant. After suppressing a revolt in Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar besieged the rebellious Tyre, which resisted for thirteen years from 587 to 574 BCE. The city ultimately capitulated under \"favorable terms\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon|title=Lebanon - Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Babylonian period, Tyre briefly became \"a republic headed by elective magistrates\",<ref name=\":16\" /> adopting a system of government consisting of a pair of judges, known as ''sufetes'', who were chosen from the most powerful noble families and served short terms.<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n=== Persian period (539\u2013332 BCE) ===\n{{Main|Achaemenid Phoenicia}}Following over three centuries vassalage and domination by their Mesopotamian neighbors, the Phoenician city states had generally managed to remain relatively independent and prosperous.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nevertheless, the conquests of the late Iron Age took their toll and left the Phoenicians politically and economically weakened.

If some aspects were just legend, like the story of Kadmos, what is clear is that the Phoenicians adopted it (perhaps, like the legend of Aeneas in Italy, very early) and made it their own. In doing so they acquired both an extra past and a reinforcement of their historical identity; and they also simultaneously gained acceptance as being in some sense Greeks</ref> \n\nAlexander's empire collapsed soon after his death in 323 BCE, dissolving into several rival kingdoms ruled by his generals, relatives, or friends (''[[diadochi]]''). The Phoenicians came under the control of the largest and most powerful of these successors, the [[Seleucids]]. The Phoenician homeland was repeatedly contested by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt]] during the forty year [[Syrian Wars]], coming under Ptolemaic rule in the third century BCE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon|title=Lebanon - Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The Seleucids reclaimed the area the following century, holding it until the mid-first century BCE.

The empire, which once stretched from the Aegean Sea to Pakistan, was reduced to a rump state comprising portions of the Levant and southeast Anatolia. Little is known of the state of Phoenicia during this time, but the Seleucid Kingdom was severely weakened and existed solely as a useful buffer between the Romans and their eastern rivals. The rise of Rome as a Mediterranean power, after centuries Phoenician decline, led to the first major challenge to Phoenician supremacy over the see in a millennium.\n\n=== The Punic Wars and Roman Rule ===\nWhile the Phoenician motherland was enduring a succession of foreign invasions, its settlement of Carthage was flourishing in northwest Africa, eventually becoming the only major continuation of Phoenician civilization and culture. Founded in the ninth century BCE as a colony of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Carthage became an independent city state around 650 BCE and soon rose to become a major power, exercising political [[hegemony]] over other Phoenician settlements throughout the [[western Mediterranean]]. \n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC.jpg|thumb|316x316px|The state of the western Mediterranean prior to the [[First Punic War]] in 264 B.C.]]\nBeginning in the fifth century BCE, while Phoenicia was under Babylonian rule, Carthage became the principal commercial center of the western Mediterranean and one of two hegemonic powers in the whole Mediterranean, rivaled only by Rome. Although it developed a distinct identity and culture, sometimes described as [[Punics|''Punic'']] (from the [[Latin]] ''poenus'' and ''punicus''), the Carthaginians still acknowledged their Phoenician heritage and maintained many of the same customs, practices, and religious traditions, albeit with some localized changes; their [[Punic language]] was a dialect of Phoenician. Indeed, the term Punic was used by the Romans, and now by modern scholars, to refer to Phoenicians of the western Mediterranean.\n\nCarthage oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nThe Seleucid Kingdom, including Phoenicia, was seized by [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] in 82 BCE, prompting Roman general [[Lucullus]] to intervene and conquer the territory in 62 BCE. In 65&nbsp;BCE, [[Pompey]] finally incorporated the territory as part of the [[Roman Syria|Roman province of Syria]]. Phoenicia became a [[Phoenice (Roman province)|separate province]] around the third century C.E., with the Phoenicians lacking the autonomy and cultural continuity that had been accorded by previous powers. \n\nWhile the annihilation of Carthage and absorption of the Levant put an end to Phoenician civilization, vestiges of the Phoenicians still remained, particularly their language. In the former motherland, it appeared to have persisted until roughly the ninth century.<ref>A. A. Caruana, ''Report on the Ph\u0153nician and Roman Antiquities in the Group of the Islands of Malta''. U.S. Government Printing Office (1852), '''p. 50.'''</ref> In the western Mediterranean, Punic culture survived in Sardinia at least 400 years after the Roman conquest, with the language still spoken and written.<ref name=\":9\" /> In the former Carthaginian heartland of Africa, Punic could be written until the second or third centuries (albeit in Roman and Greek script) and remained spoken among commoners at least until the end of the fourth century.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Phoenicians were [[Semitic people|Semites]],<ref name=\":5\" /> specifically an offshoot of the [[Canaanites]], an ancient group of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic-speaking peoples]] that emerged at least in the second millennium BCE. Though they would often remain know by outsides as Canaanites, and continued to identify as such, the Phoenicians became a distinct people some time in the Late Bronze Age, between the 14th and 13th centuries.<ref>Sanford Holst, \"Origin of the Phoenicians: Interactions in the Early Mediterranean Region,\" a paper presented at Queen Mary College, London, England, on June 29, 2008.</ref> Phoenician identity was not mutually exclusively with Canaanite identity, since the former was a subgroup of the latter. \n\nCenturies of largely peaceful relations between Phoenicians and various groups across the ancient world suggest their demographic makeup may have been cosmopolitan and variable, especially when compared to their mostly homogenous Greek and Egyptian neighbors. A 2018 study of mitochondrial lineages in Sardinia concluded that the Phoenicians were \"inclusive, multicultural and featured significant female mobility\", with evidence that indigenous Sardinians integrated \"peacefully and permanently\" with Phoenicians settlers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/ancient-phoenician-life-was-mixed-and-multicultural|title=Ancient Phoenician life was mixed and multicultural|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The study also found evidence suggesting that Europeans may have settled in the Phoenician city states. \n\nThe Phoenician settlement of Carthage, located in modern day Tunisia, grew into a multi-ethnic empire that spanned North Africa, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, the Baleric Islands, and southern Iberia. The extent to which non-Phoenicians were integrated into Carthaginian society, including through inter-marriage, is unknown. However, the Carthaginian military was documented to contain a wide variety of ethnic groups, including Berbers, Celts, and indigenous Iberians. \n\n=== Genetic studies ===\n{{History of Lebanon (ancient)}}{{History of Syria}}\n\nA study led by [[Pierre Zalloua]] claimed that six subclades of [[Haplogroup J-M172]] (J2)\u2014thought to have originated between the [[Caucasus Mountains]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]\u2014were of a \"Phoenician signature\" and present amongst the male populations of the \"coastal Lebanese Phoenician Heartland\" and wider Levant (the \"Phoenician Periphery\"), followed by other areas of historic Phoenician settlement, spanning Cyprus through to Morocco.<ref group=\"Note\">The full list includes \"Cyprus and South Turkey; then Crete; then Malta and East Sicily; then South Sardinia, Ibiza, and Southern Spain; and, finally, Coastal Tunisia and cities like Tingris [sic] in Morocco.\" Samples from other areas with significant Phoenician settlements, such as Libya and southern France, could not be included.</ref> This deliberate sequential sampling was an attempt to develop a methodology to link the documented historical expansion of a population with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns.

Lacking the arable land for agriculture and the numbers to support military conquests and demands for tribute, the Phoenician city states virtually always pursued mercantilism. \n<br />\n[[File:Phoenician trade routes (eng).svg|center|thumb|580x580px|Major Phoenician trade networks (c. 1200-800 B.C.)]]\n\n=== Trade ===\n{{See also|Phoenicians and wine}}\n[[Pliny the Elder]] remarked in the first century CE that the Phoenicians \"invented trade\". They were indeed the greatest traders of their time and owed much of their prosperity to commercial ties across the Mediterranean and possibly byond. At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, particularly [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]], a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As the Greeks began trading and colonizing across the Mediterranean\u2014possibly with the help of Phoenician knowledge and technology<ref>Richard A.

There was rarely conflict, except mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]] of the sixth century BCE, and they otherwise maintained their respective spheres of influence.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the eighth century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]; the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

The name ''Phoenicia'' may have derived from the Greek root word for \"purple,\" indicating the extent to which it was the Phoenician's most sought after trading good. The violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. Phoenicians may have discovered the dye as early as 1750 BCE.<ref>St. Clair, Kassia (2016). ''The Secret Lives of Colour''. London: John Murray. p. 162\u2013164.</ref> [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]].  \n\nAccording to contemporaneous accounts by neighboring civilizations, Tyrian purple was highly prized because of its resistance to weathering and sunlight, which only made it brighter. The Phoenician's exclusive command over the production and trade of the dye, combined with the labor intensive extraction process, made it very expensive. Tyrian purple subsequently became associated with the upper classes and soon became a [[status symbol]] in several civilizations, most notably among the Romans. Assyrian records of tribute from the Phoenicians include \"garments of brightly colored stuff\" that most likely included Tyrian purple.<ref name=\":42\" /> While the designs, ornamentation, and embroidery used in Phoenician textiles were apparently well regarded, the techniques and specific descriptions are unknown.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== Mining ====\nThe Phoenicians most likely learned mining techniques from the Egyptians.<ref name=\":18\">\"History of Phoenicia by George Rawlinson\", Chapter X - Mining, ''www.gutenberg.org,'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010 www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010]</ref> Mining operations in the Phoenician homeland were limited, since iron was the only metal of any worth.

Sardinia may have been colonized almost exclusively for its mineral resources; Phoenician settlements were concentrated in the southern and southwestern parts of the island, which were rich in copper and lead, and their cities were positioned relatively close to these sources. Piles of [[Scoria|scorae]] and copper ingots, which appear to predate the subsequent Roman occupation, suggest the Phoenicians both mined and processed metals on the island.<ref name=\":18\" /> The Iberian Peninsula, which saw significant Phoenician settlement, was known for being the richest source of numerous metals in antiquity, including gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead.<ref name=\":18\" /> The output of these metals during the Phoenicians and Carthaginian occupation strongly implied large scale mining operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2HCH0010|title=History of Phoenicia by George Rawlinson|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> There is documentation that the Carthaginians relied on slave labor for mining, though it is unknown if the Phoenicians as a whole did so.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe Phoenician homeland lacked sufficient arable land to support large scale agriculture. The most notable agricultural product was wine (known as ''cherem''), which the Phoenicians helped propagate across the Mediterranean. The [[Vitis vinifera|common grape vine]] may have been domesticated by the Phoenicians or Canaanites, although it most likely arrived from [[Transcaucasia]] (modern Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan) via [[Mesopotamia]] or [[Black Sea]] trade routes. Vines grew readily in the coastal Levant, and the wines of [[Byblos]] were exported to Egypt as early as the [[Old Kingdom]] period (2686\u20132134 BCE). The wines of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] were popular in the ancient Mediterranean, as evidenced by the discovery of shipwrecks still full of wine.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/ships-0714.html MIT technology helps map ancient Phoenician shipwrecks] MIT press release</ref> As the first great traders of wine, the Phoenicians apparently developed techniques to preserve it; to prevent oxidation, vessels were sealed with a layer of olive oil, pinewood, and resin, which may have inspired the [[Greeks|Greek]] taste for [[retsina]]. \n\nWine played an important part in [[Phoenician religion]], and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Dionysus]] (and by extension the Roman god Bacchus) may have originated in the wine rituals of Canaan. The great temple at Baalbek has many depictions of vines and wine drinking,<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=2&id=296 Baalbec - Ruins of the Temple of Bacchus] Liverpool Museums</ref><ref>[http://www.medinaarts.com/JHLCat08.htm Roberts prints of Baalbek] Medina Arts</ref> which could have influenced [[Jewish]] [[Passover (Jewish holiday)|Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] and the [[Christianity and alcohol|Christian Eucharist]]. Wine also featured heavily in [[Ugarit#Ugaritic literature|Ugaritic poetry]], such as the ''Rapiuma'':<blockquote>Day long they pour the wine, ... must-wine, fit for rulers. Wine, sweet and abundant, Select wine... The choice wine of Lebanon, Most nurtured by El ...<ref>Robert Sechrist, ''Planet of the Grapes: A Geography of Wine'', p. 5.</ref></blockquote>The Phoenicians may also have taught [[winemaking]] to some of their trading partners. The ancient Iberians began producing wine from local grape varieties following their encounter with the Phoenicians. Iberian cultivars subsequently formed the basis of most western European wine.<ref>Robert Sechrist, ''Planet of the Grapes: A Geography of Wine'', p. 6-7.</ref>\n\nCarthage, which had more abundant and fertile land than other Phoenician settlements, practiced highly advanced and productive agriculture. Homer described Carthage as capable of  \"yielding any crop in due season \u2026 where the vine would never wither, and there is plenty of land level enough for the plough, where farmers could count on cutting a deep crop at every harvest time, for the soil below the surface is exceeding rich. Also, it has a safe harbor\u2026 at the head of the which, there is a stream of fresh water, running out of a cave in a grove of poplar trees.\" The Carthaginians appeared to have made good use of their land, inventing [[Rotary quern|hand-driven rotary mills]] in the sixth century BCE and horse mills in the fourth century BCE, while also adopting or improving upon [[Plough|iron ploughs]], [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], and [[Threshing board|threshing machines]]. Carthage was subsequently an agricultural powerhouse of the Mediterranean, exporting olives, nuts, honey, wheat, and various fruits and vegetables, especially figs, pears, pomegranates, grates, and dates. Livestock were also raised, particularly mules, oxen, goats, and horses. Circumstantial evidence suggests Carthage also developed [[viticulture]] and wine production before the fourth century BCE, with raisin wine (''[[passum]]'') being especially popular, even among the hostile Romans.+\n\nCarthage produced one of history's earliest [[Agronomist|agronmists]], known only as When of Carthage. Considered the \"Father of Farmng\" by the Greeks and Romans, he produced a 28-book treatise on a wide variety of agricultural topics, ranging from beekeeping to how to deterine the heath of cattle. His work was so well regarded that wome conquered and destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, the Roman Senate decreed that s famous treatise on agriculture be translated into Latin. Unfortunately, Mago's original work is lost, and only fragments remain of its translation.\n\n=== Phoenician ships ===\nAs a predominately maritime people, the Phoenicians were among the earliest and most influential pioneers in shipbuilding and design. Naval historian [[Richard Woodman]] described them as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the inventors of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"<ref>Richard Woodman, The History of the Ship (New York: Lyons Press, 1987), 16.</ref>\n[[File:Phoenician ship.jpg|thumb|Phoenician ship carved on the face of a sarcophagus (second century A.D.)]]\nAs early as 1200 BCE, the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. During the Bronze Age, they developed the [[keel]], the bottom-most longitudinal structural element on a ship, which was a significant advancement over the more common [[Dugout canoe|dugout]] vessels, which were limited in size, durability, maneuverability. Pegged [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joints were developed to make Phoenician ships sturdier, and proved effective enough to serve as a standard template across the Mediterranean until late into the Roman Empire.\n\nOther key ship components, such as the [[Brail|brailed rig sail]], which allowed for greater maneuverability, and the [[crow's nest]], which provided a vital lookout point, most likely originated in the Levant. Around 700 BCE, the Phoenicians were possibly the first to introduce the ''[[bireme]]'', a large [[galley]] that had two tiers of oars staggered on either side of the vessel, which allowed for significantly greater propulsion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/galley-ship|title=Galley {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> An Assyrian account describes Phoenicians quickly evading capture with these ships.<ref>Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh', first series, pl. 71; 'Nineveh and its Remains', l.s.c.</ref> The Carthaginians, who descended from the Phoenicians, had become a major power in the western Mediterranean largely because of their ability to quickly mass produce ships; parts were labeled with the Punic alphabet, indicating an industrial method of serial production.<ref>Piero Bartoloni, \u201cShips and Navigation,\u201d in The Phoenicians, ed.

The [[amphora]], a type of container used for both dry and liquid gods, was an ancient Phoenician invention that became a standardized measurement of volume for close to two thousand years. The remnants of self-cleaning artificial harbors have been discovered in Sidon, Tyre, Atlit, and Acre.<ref>Arad Haggi, \u201cReport on Underwater Excavation at the Phoenician Harbour, Atlit, Israel,\u201d International Journal of Nautical Archeology 39 (2010): 283.</ref> The Phoenicians relied on [[celestial navigation]], and most likely discovered Polaris (the North Star), which enabled nighttime sailing and shorter open-sea routes; the Greeks subsequently called Polaris the \"Phoenician Star.\" The wind rose, a precursor to the compass rose, was apparently of Phoenician, or at least Levantine, origin. The first example of [[admiralty law]] also appears in the Levant.<ref>Shelley Wachsmann, Seagoing Ships & Seamanship in the Bronze Age Levant (College Station, TX: Texas A & M University Press, 1998), 300, 51, 323-325, 332.</ref> The Phoenicians continued to contribute to cartography into the Iron Age.<ref>Mark Woolmer, Ancient Phoenicia: An Introduction (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2011), p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: {{lang|grc-Latn|Galloi}} (tubs) and {{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}} (horses). The names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the seventh and eighth centuries BCE, which were tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and had horse heads on both ends. (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that the ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]], equated with the Semitic-Levantine god [[Yam (god)|Yam]]. In ''[[Oeconomicus]],'' Greek historian and philosopher [[Xenophon]], through the Greek character Ischomachus, describes in great detail the sophistication and craftsmanship of Phoenician ships:<blockquote>I think that the best and most perfect arrangement of things that I ever saw was when I went to look at the great Phoenician sailing-vessel; for I saw the largest amount of naval tackling separately disposed in the smallest stowage possible. For a ship, as you well know, is brought to anchor, and again got under way, by a vast number of wooden implements and of ropes and sails the sea by means of a quantity of rigging, and is armed with a number of contrivances against hostile vessels, and carries about with it a large supply of weapons for the crew, and, besides, has all the utensils that a man keeps in his dwelling-house, for each of the messes. In addition, it is laden with a quantity of merchandise which the owner carries with him for his own profit. Now all the things which I have mentioned lay in a space not much bigger than a room which would conveniently hold ten beds. And I remarked that they severally lay in a way that they did not obstruct one another, and did not require anyone to search for them; and yet they were neither placed at random, nor entangled one with another, so as to consume time when they were suddenly wanted for use. Also, I found the captain's assistant, who is called 'the look-out man,' so well acquainted with the position of all the articles, and with the number of them, that even when at a distance he could tell where everything lay, and how many there were of each sort, just as anyone who has learnt to read can tell the number of letters in the name of Socrates and the proper place for each of them. Moreover, I saw this man, in his leisure moments, examining and testing everything that a vessel needs when at sea; so, as I was surprised, I asked him what he was about, whereupon he replied--'Stranger, I am looking to see, in case anything should happen, how everything is arranged in the ship, and whether anything is wanting, or is inconveniently situated; for when a storm arises at sea, it is not possible either to look for what is wanting, or to put to right what is arranged awkwardly.<ref>George Rawlinson, ''History of the Phoenician Civilization,'' citing Xen.

The leading city states were Sur ([[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]), Sydon ([[Sidon]]), and Jbail (modern [[Byblos]], one of the oldest sites of civilization). Throughout Phoenician history, at least one of these cities was politically and economically dominant at any given time. Rivalries were common, but open warfare less so. Although they never appeared to have joined in a formal confederation, as seen among the Greek city states, informal cooperation seemed common. \n\nNumerous others cities existed in the Levant alone, many probably unknown, including Berut (modern [[Beirut]]) Ampi, Amia, Arqa, [[Baalbek]], Botrys, Sarepta and [[Tripoli]]. From the late tenth century BCE, the Phoenician's expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies beyond Lebanon and throughout the Mediterranean. Phoenician settlement was especially concentrated in Cyprus, Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, northwest Africa, the Balearic Islands, and southern Iberia. Canaanite deities like [[Baal]] and [['Ashtart|Astarte]] were being worshiped from Cyprus and Sicily to Spain and Portugal, most notably at Carthage (''{{lang|phn|Qart Hada\u0161t}}'') in modern Tunisia.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = \n| width = 330\n| image1 = Griechischen und ph\u00f6nizischen Kolonien.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Carthage Holdings.png\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left, map of Phoenician (in yellow) and Greek colonies around 8th to 6th century BC (with German legend).

However, by the early Iron Age (roughly 1300 BCE) the Phoenicians had emerged as a distinct people, with their culture, economy, and daily life being heavily centered on commerce and maritime trade. Their propensity for seafaring brought them into contact with numerous other civilizations, possibly more so than any other contemporary people, leading to a uniquely cosmopolitan society that incorporated different customs, artistic styles, and faith traditions.\n=== Politics and government ===\n[[File:King Hiram Of Tyre.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Hiram I|King Hiram I of Tyre]], located in the village of Hanawai (Hanawiya or Hanawey) in southern Lebanon.]]Despite a shared language, culture, and religion, the Phoenicians never constituted a single, cohesive political unit, and it is unknown whether they viewed themselves as a nation in the modern sense. The Phoenicians organized into city states that were fiercely independent in both domestic and foreign affairs. Formal alliances between city states were rare, and cooperation was generally informal, loosely aligned, and ad hoc. Unlike their Greek counterparts, warfare between Phoenician city states was rarer still, although rivalries did exist and coercion was sometimes employed. The relative power and influence of city states varied over time. Sidon was dominant between the 12th and 11th centuries BCE, and exercised some influence over its neighbors, but by the tenth century BCE, Tyre rose to become the most powerful city.\n\nPhoenician society was highly stratified and predominantly [[Monarchy|monarchical]], at least in its earlier stages. Hereditary kings usually governed with absolute power and had responsibilities over civic, commercial, and religious affairs. They often relied upon senior officials from the noble and merchant classes. The priesthood was a distinct class, though usually of royal lineage or from leading merchant families. The king was considered a representative of the gods and carried many obligations and duties with respect to religious processions and rituals. Priests were thus highly influential and often became intertwined with the royal family.\n\nUnlike their Greek and Egyptian counterparts, Phoenician kings did not commemorate their reign through sculptures or monuments. Their wealth, power, and accomplishments were usually conveyed through ornate sarcophaguses, like that of [[Ahiram sarcophagus|Ahiram]] of Byblos. The Phoenicians kept fairly meticulous records of their rulers in the form of tomb inscriptions, which are among the few primary sources still available. Historians have been able to determine a clear line of succession over centuries for some city-states, notably Byblos and Tyre.\n\n==== Semi-democratic government ====\nNot all Phoenician city states were absolute monarchies, and their political systems appeared to have changed and evolved with time and circumstances. British classicist [[Simon Hornblower]] notes that the Phoenicians \"had something comparable to the self-regulating city-state or ''polis'' (and) the Greek political arrangements we most admire.\"<ref>Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): '''123'''.</ref> As early as the 14th century BCE, Egyptian envoys reported that Phoenician assemblies \"might act on their own behalf\"; when the city state of Irqata declared its allegiance to the pharaoh, it did so as \"Irqata and its elders\", without reference to a king.<ref name=\":1\">Stephen Stockwell, Geopolitics, History, and International Relations , Vol. 2, No. 2 (2010), pp. 123- 135</ref> Similarly, the pharaoh is addressed by \"the citizens of Tunip,\" the \"people from Gubla (Byblos),\" and \"the men of Arwad.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> An 11th century Egyptian report found that while the king of Byblos managed trade and religious life, state affairs were handled with advice by an \"assembly\".\n\nIn the sixth century BCE, during the period of Babylonian rule, Tyre briefly adopted a system of government consisting of a pair of judges, known as sufetes, who were chosen from the most powerful noble families and served short terms.<ref name=\":10\">Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): '''128'''.</ref> One scholar characterized Tyre during this period as \"a republic headed by elective magistrates\".<ref name=\":16\">Bondi, S.F.

The importance of trade to the Phoenician economy evidently led to a gradual sharing of power between the king and assemblies of merchant families.]]\nBy the seventh century BCE, many city states had circumscribed the power of their kings, who now shared some degree of power with the merchant families and sailors who were key to the state's prosperity. Kings increasingly required the support of different stakeholders, and there is evidence that the councils and assemblies that had previously played an advisory role had accumulated some power over the state. The Greek historian Arrian reported that senior officials were sometimes called upon to govern when the king was predisposed, and accounts from other outsiders claimed that councils were the true rulers, such that they could impose their decisions on the king during emergencies. In effect, many Phoenician city states appeared to be plutocracies ruled by the wealthiest families.<ref>Aristotle (5 November 2012). ''Politics: A Treatise on Government''.

Details regarding the duties of these offices are sparse, but it is known that the governor was responsible for collecting taxes, implementing decrees, supervising judges, and ensuring the administration of law and justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> As warfare was rare among the mostly mercantile Phoenicians, the commander of the army was generally responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the city-state and its hinterlands.[[File:PhoenicianStela-4cBC-Tyre-NationalMuseumOfBeirut 03102019RomanDeckert.jpg|thumb|Stela from Tyre with Phoenician inscriptions (c. fourth century BCE). National Museum of Beirut.]]The Phoenicians had a system of courts and judges that resolved disputes and punished crimes based on a semi-codified body of law and traditional. Laws were implemented by the state and were the responsibility of the ruler and certain designated officials. Like other Levantine societies, laws were harsh and biased, reflecting the social stratification of society. The murder of a commoner was treated as less serious than of a nobleman, and the upper classes had the most rights; the wealthy often escaped punishment by paying a fine. Free men of any class could represent themselves in court and had more rights than women and children, while slaves had no rights at all. Men could often deflect punishment to their wives, children, or slaves, even having them serve his sentence in his place. Lawyers eventually emerged as a profession for those who could not plead their own case.\n\nAs in neighboring societies at the time, penalties for crimes were often severe, usually reflecting the principle of reciprocity; for example, the killing of a slave would be punished by having the offender's slave killed. Imprisonment was rare, with fines, exile, punishment, and execution were main remedies.\n\n=== Military ===\nAs with most aspects of Phoenician civilization, there are few records of their military or approach to warfare. Compared to most of their neighbors, the Phoenicians generally had little interest in conquest and were a relatively peaceful people.<ref>\u201cThey became the first to provide a link between the culture of the ancient Near East and that of the uncharted world of the West\u2026They went not for conquest as the Babylonians and Assyrians did, but for trade. Profit rather than plunder was their policy.\u201d James B. Pritchard, introduction to The Sea Traders, by Maitland A. Edey (New York: Time-Life Books, 1974), '''7.'''</ref> The wealth and prosperity of all their city states rested on foreign trade, which required good relations and a certain degree of mutual trust. They also lacked the territory and agricultural base to support a population large enough for anything other than city defense; each city had an army commander in charge of a defensive garrison, but the specifics of the role, or of city defense, are unknown.\n\nMore is known about the [[military of Carthage]], though it is uncertain whether the Carthaginian military was reflective of general Phoenician practice, since they were the only Phoenician polity to establish a sprawling, multi-ethnic empire.<ref>P.

Retrieved 22 February 2013.</ref> Carthage's military traditions generally reflected Phoenician roots combined with native North African and Greek influences. Like other Phoenicians, the Carthaginians were largely a maritime and trading power, and did not maintain a large, permanent, standing army. [[Polybius]] wrote that they were naturally \"superior at sea both in efficiency and equipment, because seamanship has long been their national craft\" and they were \"more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people\"<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=Polybius \u2022 Histories \u2014 Book\u00a06|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> By contrast, he claims the Carthaginian infantry was \"neglected\" and its cavalry given \"slight attention\".<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAt its peak, Carthage's navy comprised 300 to 350 warships. In the First Punic War, the Romans, who previously lacked experience in naval warfare, persevered partly by reverse-engineering captured Carthaginian ships. In the Third Punic War, Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, who now faced a larger Roman force: They augmented their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). This allowed them to resist far longer despite being outnumbered.\n\nAs far as land warfare, Livy claims that Carthage had at least 40,000 professional soldiers prior to the Third Punic War. Otherwise, it relied heavily on a multinational force of foreign mercenaries and subjects, including ethnic [[Berbers|Libyans]] and [[Numidians]] from its surrounding territory, and [[Celts]], [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]], [[Iberians]] from its overseas territories. Its cavalry force was formidable, composed of light [[Numidian cavalry]] and mounted [[North African elephant|North African elephants]]. [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]], armed with straps of cloth to toss small stones at high speeds, were also fielded.\n\nUnlike its army, the Carthaginian navy was drawn mostly from Phoenician citizenry. Perhaps reflecting historic Phoenician affinity for the sea, the navy was considered a stable and prestigious profession that offered financial security. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, as poor and unemployed citizens could find an outlet for upward mobility. The reputation and quality of the Carthaginian navy, conceded even by their Roman rivals, implies that their sailors were well trained even during peacetime.\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Phoenician language|Phoenician alphabet|Alphabet}}\nThe [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician language]] is classified in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] subgroup of Northwest [[Semitic languages|Semitic]].

She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother [[Hadad|Baal]]. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\" (60\u20132), who adds that the Phoenician [[Philo of Byblos]] (64\u2013141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess [[Athena]]. Also, Patai at 63\u20136 identifies Anath with the biblical \"Queen of Heaven\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r\u00f4le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god.

Hence the \"explanation\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\" ... \"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\"</blockquote></ref>\n\nA problematic theory derived from [[sociology of religion]] proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born ''Libyphoenician'' oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.<ref>Compare {{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}.</ref> A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved eventually to become supreme.<ref name=\"Abun-Nasr, 1971\" /> A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\n[[File:Tunisise Carthage Tophet Salambo 03.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Tophet funerary [[stele]], showing (below moon and sun) a symbol of Tanit, queen goddess of Carthage]]\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

Though initially vassals of Egypt during the Bronze Age, in the centuries following the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Phoenicians usually maintained relatively amicable relations with the Egyptians, though this varied by dynasty. This is best illustrated by the existence of a Phoenician settlement and temple in the capital city of Memphis, which included a temple, as the Egyptians were generally intolerant of foreigners.<ref>Rawlinson, \"It is most remarkable that the Egyptians, intolerant as they usually were of strangers, should have allowed the Phoenicians to settle in their southern capital, Memphis, and to build a temple and inhabit a quarter there.\" ''History of the Phoenicians,'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2H_4_0021 www.gutenberg.org/files/2331/2331-h/2331-h.htm#link2H_4_0021]</ref> The Phoenicians were also heavily influenced by Egyptian culture, particularly with respect to artistic conventions and motifs.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Relations with the Greeks ===\nPhoenicia's ties with the Greece appeared to have began with the Minoan civilization on Crete (1950-1450 BCE), which together with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] (1600\u20131100 BCE) is considered the progenitor of classical Greece.

In both Phoenician and Greek mythologies, [[Cadmus]] is a Phoenician prince, the son of king Agenor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Herodotus credits Cadmus for bringing the Phoenician alphabet to Greece{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=112}} approximately sixteen hundred years before Herodotus' time, or around 2000 BCE,{{sfn|Herodotus, The Histories|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D4 II.145.4] }} as he attested:\n{{quote|text=These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks.

Heracles was inspired by the Phoenician god [[Melqart]], sometimes called the Tyrian Heracles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Melqart|title=Melqart {{!}} Phoenician deity|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> who was equally revered by both peoples. An inscription in Malta, made by Tyrians between the second and third centuries BCE, was dedicated to Herakles/Melqart in both Phoenician and Greek. [[File:Stela with Melqart on his lion.JPG|thumb|Stela from [[Amrit]] with [[Melqart]] on his lion (c. 550 BCE). The patron god of Tyre, and a major deity in the Phoenician and Punic religions, he was typically identified by the Greeks as Heracles and was even called the \"Tyrian Heracles\"\"]]Another prominent Phoenician is [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]], one of the most famous consorts of Zeus and the mother of [[Basileus|King]] [[Minos]] of [[Crete]], sometimes described as the sister of Cadmus. They have several other siblings that played prominent roles in Greek mythology, and in some incarnations are related to Poseidon. The integration of Phoenician figures into Greek mythology, often in a heroic or privileged position, suggests some degree of Greek affinity towards Phoenicians.\n\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \"Lord of the Sea\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \"Poseidon\u2013Neptune\" figure of Phoenician religion. While such a figure is attested by authorities and inscriptions as being revered by merchants and sailors, a singular name has yet to be found.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ribichini |first=S. |year=1988 |chapter=Beliefs and Religious Life |editor=Sabatino Moscati |title=The Phoenicians |pp=104\u201325 |location=Milan |publisher=Gruppo Editoriale Fabbri }}</ref> However, there are names for sea gods from individual city states. Yamm is the god of the sea of [[Ugarit]], an ancient city state north to Phoenicia. Some scholars have identified Yamm with Poseidon, although he has also been identified with [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgarten|first=A.I.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BM8UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&dq=Poseidon+Phoenician+Yamm#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos: A Commentary|publisher=Brill|year=1981|isbn=978-90-04-06369-3|page=207}}</ref> Yamm is in cosmic conflict with Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth who is often associated with Zeus. While Yamm is nominally the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos,<ref>Habel, N.C. 1964. ''Yahweh Versus Baal: A Conflict of Religious Cultures''. New York: Bookman Associates</ref> in direct opposition to the order represented by Baal. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power, in some versions killing him, while in others, the goddess Athtart intervenes to save Yamm but advise that he remain in his own province for being defeated. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot, whose Greek equivalent, Hades, is the brother of Poseidon.<ref>Ringgren, H. 1917. ''Religions of the Ancient Near East''. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press</ref> \n\n==== Greek accounts and attitudes ====\nThe Greeks had varying dispositions to the Phoenicians, generally expressing an ambivalence for their merchantlistic culture. In his [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']], Greek philosopher [[Plato]] contends that the love of money is a tendency of the soul found amongst Phoenicians and Egyptians, which distinguishes them from the Greeks who tend towards the love of knowledge.<ref>Plato, ''Republic'', IV (435e\u2013436a)</ref> In his ''Laws'', he asserts that this love of money has led the Phoenicians and Egyptians to develop skills in cunning and trickery ([[wikt:\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1]]) rather than wisdom ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1]]}}).<ref>Plato Laws V (747c)</ref>\n\nSuch a view is expressed in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', where the Phoenicians are described as skilled sailors and artisans, but also \"greedy knaves\".<ref>Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity,'' '''p. 325.'''\n\n<br /></ref> By contrast, the ''Iliad'' conveys apparent Greek affinity for Phoenician craftsmanship. [[Hecuba]], in seeking her best gown as a sacrifice to the goddess [[Athena]], chooses one embroidered by \"Sidonian\" women; Achilles offers the fastest man in a race a Sidonian bowl as a prize.<ref name=\":11\" /> Xenophon speaks favorably about the sophistication and orderliness of Phoenician ships, while Aristotle regards Carthage as a model for a merit based society: \"Carthage, as is clear, supplied the principal criterion by which to measure success.\"<ref>Eric S. Gruen, Rethinking the Other in Antiquity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011), 199-120.</ref>\n\nIn his ''Histories'', Herodotus gives the Persian and Greek accounts of a series of kidnappings that led to the Trojan War. While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians [[Raptio|kidnapped]] a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] from [[Argos]]. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall, the Persians considered the Greeks to be their enemy.{{sfn|Herodotus, The History|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html I.1.1\u20135]}}\n\nNotwithstanding these mixed views, centuries of otherwise amicable cultural and commercial ties between the Phoenicians and Greeks\u2014with commonalities such as a maritime tradition, self governing city states, and mythological figures\u2014meant the two peoples were sometimes regarded as \"relatives\".<ref>Millar, p. 50: Secondly, and more important, when the Phoenicians began to explore the storehouse of Greek culture, they could find, among other things, themselves, already credited with creative roles\u2014not all of which, as it happens, were purely legendary. If some aspects were just legend, like the story of Kadmos, what is clear is that the Phoenicians adopted it (perhaps, like the legend of Aeneas in Italy, very early) and made it their own. In doing so they acquired both an extra past and a reinforcement of their historical identity; and they also simultaneously gained acceptance as being in some sense Greeks</ref> \n\n=== Relations with the Israelites ===\nDespite being notoriously belligerent towards their neighbors, the Israelites apparently took exception to the Phoenicians, especially those of Tyre. King Hiram of Tyre is credited with helping build Solomon's Temple, providing materials and skilled craftsmen; in exchange, Solomon paid tribute and even ceded some territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hiram-king-of-Tyre|title=Hiram {{!}} king of Tyre|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> As Rawlinson notes, good relations the Jewish Bible describes many more examples of cordial if not warm relations between the peoples: <blockquote>Hiram\u2019s friendly dealings with David and Solomon are well known; but the ''continued'' alliance between the Phoenicians and the Israelites has attracted less attention. Solomon took wives from Phoenicia; Ahab married the daughter of Ithobalus, king of Sidon; Phoenicia furnished timber for the second Temple; Isaiah wound up his prophecy against Tyre with a consolation; our Lord found faith in the Syro-Phoenician woman; in the days of Herod Agrippa, Tyre and Sidon still desired peace with Jud\u00e6a, \"because their country was nourished by the king\u2019s country.\"</blockquote>Such amiable relations were also remarkable given that the Phoenicians were [[Paganism|pagan]] and the Israelites were staunch monotheists. \n\n== Ancient sources ==\n\n=== In the Bible ===\n[[File:Hiram shows the planes to Solomon by J.J. Scheuchzer.jpg|thumb|Hiram I, King of Tyre, shows the plans for the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] of the Israelites to King Solomon. The Phoenicians are referenced over 100 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (J.J. Scheuchzer).]]\nHiram (also spelled Huran), the king of Tyre, is associated with the building of [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon's temple]]. [[Books of Kings#Contents|1 Kings 5:1]] says: \"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\" [[2 Chronicles]] 2:14 says: \"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him&nbsp;...\"\n\nIn [[Masonic]] lore, [[Hiram Abiff]] is the architect of Solomon's temple and a central figure Masonic rituals and mythology.\n\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: [[Elijah]] execrated [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], the princess from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] who became a consort of King [[Ahab]] and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\n\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \"Syro-Phoenicians\", as in the [[Gospel of Mark]]: \"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\".<ref>7:26</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[Bible]]'' itself derives from Greek ''{{lang|grc|biblion}}'', which means \"book\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of ''[[Byblos]]'', the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Bible&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. \"Bible\"].

The [[Septuagint]], the Vulgate and the Targum of Jonathan render Tarshish as Carthage, but other biblical commentators read it as [[Tartessos]], perhaps in Iberia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Albright|first1=W.F.|year=1941|title=New light on the early history of Phoenician colonization|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=83|issue=83|pages=14\u201322|doi=10.2307/3218739|jstor=3218739}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Frank M.|year=1972|title=An interpretation of the Nora Stone|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=208|issue=208|pages=13\u201319|doi=10.2307/1356374|jstor=1356374}}</ref> The discovery of the Nora Stone and Nora Fragment on Sardinia suggests this might be the loation, as the former mentions Tarshish in its Phoenician inscription.

Beginning in the early 1960s, new and reexamined discoveries by scholars and archaeologists have shed more light on the Phoenicians and their contributions and achievements.<ref name=\":4\">\"Modern Phoenician studies were launched during the early 1960\u2019s by Sabatino Moscati and the Italian school.

The Phoenician alphabet was innovative in its \"egalitarian\" nature, providing a simple writing system that did not require a small caste of professional scribes, priests, and officials, as in Egypt or Mesopotamia.<ref name=\":5\" /> It could be written on a variety of media and was easy to learn due to its fixed nature, allowing for easier communication across classes and cultures.<ref name=\":5\" /> In addition to facilitating commercial relations\u2014and thus leading to the exchange of goods and ideas that brought prosperity to the region\u2014it has been argued that the Phoenician alphabet proved pivotal to the progress of civilization as a whole:<blockquote>The alphabetical (like the numerical) system is how societies organize information. Beyond literacy and systematization, the alphabet stimulates both abstract and rational thought through the phonetic coding and decoding process. As a result, the adoption of Phoenician letters\u2014especially in Ionia and Athens\u2014created an intellectual environment for the development of Greek, and, subsequently, Western science.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>\nAnthropologist Ralph Linton argues that the Phoenician's \"main role in the development of the Greek and other Mediterranean cultures was as intermediaries between Asia and Europe.\"<ref>Ralph Linton, The Tree of Culture (New York: Alfred A.

As one of the few civilizations to emerge from the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] relatively unscathed, the Phoenicians led the way in reopening trade routes that connected the Egyptian, Greek, and Mesopotamian civilizations. As the dominant seafarers and traders well into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians maintained an unparalleled commercial network that revitalized the region and contributed to the \"civilizational development of the Mediterranean basin.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Historian [[Jerry H.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].\n\nThe [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California.

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref name=\"Osborne2012\">{{cite book|first=Thomas J. |last=Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}}|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.

Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].\n\nThe [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].\n\n===Regions===\n\n{{further|List of regions of California|List of places in

The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.<ref name=\"Helfland 2008\">{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title=State has a relaxed view on religion\u2014Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 24, 2008 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |access-date=December 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n\n{{Main|Sports in California|List of professional sports teams in California}}\n\nCalifornia has nineteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state.

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

He had an eight-year NFL career, starting in 104 games on the offensive line and playing for the Indianapolis Colts [[Super Bowl XLI]] winning team.\n\nNine KSU players were selected by other leagues directly challenging the NFL: two were drafted in the 1948 [[All-America Football Conference]] draft ([[Rollin Prather]] and Mike Zeleznek),<ref name=KSUdraft/><ref>{{Cite web|title=1948 AAFC Draft |publisher=profootballarchives.com |url=http://www.profootballarchives.com/1948AAFCDraft.html |accessdate=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IBDdSvum?url=http://www.profootballarchives.com/1948AAFCDraft.html |archivedate=July 17, 2013 }}</ref> two were selected in the [[1983 USFL Draft]] (Amos Donaldson and Will Cokeley), three were selected in the [[1984 USFL Draft]] (Reggie Singletary, L.

Because four KSU players were selected in both the NFL and AFL drafts, the total number of selections listed below is 151 (including one \"redshirt\" selection in the 1965 AFL Draft), through the 2019 draft.\n\nEach NFL [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] seeks to add new players through the annual NFL Draft. The [[NFL Draft#Procedure and rules|draft rules]] were last updated in 2009. The team with the worst record the previous year picks first, the next-worst team second, and so on. Teams that did not make the playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with any remaining ties broken by [[strength of schedule]]. [[NFL Playoffs|Playoff participants]] are sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and [[Super Bowl]]).\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| B\n| [[Back (American football)|Back]]\n| K \n| [[Placekicker|Kicker]]\n| NT\n| [[Nose tackle]]\n|-\n| C\n| [[Center (American football)|Center]]\n| LB\n| [[Linebacker]]\n| BB\n| [[Blocking back]]\n|-\n| DB\n| [[Defensive back]]\n| P\n| [[Punter (American football)|Punter]]\n| HB\n| [[Halfback (American football)|Halfback]]\n|-\n| DE\n| [[Defensive end]]\n| QB\n| [[Quarterback]]\n| WR\n| [[Wide receiver]]\n|-\n| DT\n| [[Defensive tackle]]\n| RB\n| [[Running back]]\n| G\n| [[Guard (American football)|Guard]]\n|-\n| E\n| [[End (American football)|End]]\n| T\n| [[Offensive tackle]]\n| TE\n| [[Tight end]]\n|-\n| FB\n| [[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" align=\"center\" | *\n| colspan=\"5\" | Selected to a [[Pro Bowl]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#DDFFDD\" align=\"center\" | \u2020\n| colspan=\"5\" | Won a [[List of NFL champions|NFL championship]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#D0E7FF\" align=\"center\" | \u2021\n| colspan=\"5\" | Selected to a Pro Bowl and won an NFL championship\n|-\n|}\n\n==Players selected==\n<!-- IMAGES -->\n[[File:Terence newman.JPG|thumb|right|Terence Newman was drafted 5th overall by the Dallas Cowboys in the 2003 NFL Draft.|alt=An American football player leans forward.
