Work started on the line in April 1843 and the line and its stations were opened on 1 May 1844. Reedham station opened with the line and was, as it is now, situated east of Cantley station and west of Berney Arms station. The Y&NR was the first public railway line in Norfolk.\nOn 30 June 1845 a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Y&NR with the [[Norwich & Brandon Railway]] came into effect and Reedham station became a Norfolk Railway asset.<ref name=Butt /><ref>C.J. Allen {{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845 an Act incorporated the Lowestoft Railway & Harbour Company (LR&HC). In 1846 the LR&HC was leased to the Norfolk Railway (NR) and work started on building a line from Lowestoft, in Suffolk to join the Yarmouth & Norwich line South-East of Reedham. On 1 July 1847 the NR opens the Lowestoft to Reedham line. The station south-east of Reedham on the line to Lowestoft was Haddiscoe.\n\nA couple of months after the Lowestoft line opened, the next station west, {{rws|Cantley}}, was closed by the Norfolk Railway.\n\nThe [[Eastern Counties Railway]] (ECR) and its rival the [[Eastern Union Railway]] (EUR) were both sizing up the NR to acquire and expand their railway empire. The ECR trumped the EUR by taking over the NR, including Reedham Station on 8 May 1848.\n\nThe ECR reopened Cantley in 1851, once again making it the next station west.\n\nBy the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway, which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862, when the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. Actually, Reedham became a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR and the EUR before the Bill received the Royal Assent.<ref>CJ Allen - Great Eastern - page46</ref>\n\nBy the first decade of the last Century the GER started building new stations at Reedham and at Haddiscoe. On 9 May 1904 Haddiscoe Station was closed and replaced by Haddiscoe Low Level on a new site. On 1 June 1904 the GER opened today's Reedham Station and closed the Y&NR station which was 300 metres East of the new station.\n\nThe system settled down for the next 17 years, apart from the disruption of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The difficult economic circumstances that existed after the war led the Government to pass the [[Railways Act 1921]], which led to the creation of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|Big Four]]. The GER amalgamated with several other companies to form the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER). Reedham became a LNER station on 1 January 1923.\n\nIn 1928 the LNER renamed Reedham as ''Reedham (Norfolk)'' to distinguish it from the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway)]] station of [[Reedham (Surrey) railway station|Reedham-Surrey]].\n\nAt [[Transport Act 1947|nationalisation]] in 1948, the station and its services were transferred to the [[Eastern Region of British Railways]].\n\nFollowing the [[privatisation of British Rail]], [[Railtrack]] became responsible for infrastructure maintenance in 1994. Following Railtrack's financial problems [[Network Rail]] took over operation of the infrastructure in 2002.\n\nThe station and its operations came under the [[Anglia Railways]] franchise in 1997. Subsequently, [[National Express East Anglia]], then known as ''One'', took over management in 2004.\n\nThe station, along with its services, were transferred to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Abellio Greater Anglia]] in 2012.\n\nIn October 2018, Network Rail remodelled the Reedham Junction layout and begun the resignalling process, temporarily closing the Berney Arms line to Great Yarmouth.

During the first [[Red Scare]] in the United States, the takeover of Russia by the communist [[Bolshevik]]s was considered by many a threat to [[free market]]s, [[religious freedom]] and liberal democracy. Meanwhile, under the tutelage of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] the only party permitted by the [[constitution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union constitution]], state institutions were intimately entwined with those of the party. By the late 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated the regime's control over the country's economy and society through a system of [[economic planning]] and [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]].\n\nBetween the Russian Revolution and the Second World War, Soviet-style communist rule only spread to one state that was not later incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1924, communist rule was established in neighboring Mongolia, a traditional outpost of Russian influence bordering the Siberian region. However, throughout much of Europe and the Americas criticism of the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet regime among [[anticommunism|anticommunists]] continued unabated. After the end of World War II, Soviet Union took control over the territories reached by the [[Red Army]], establishing what later became known as [[Eastern Bloc]]. Following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]], the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].\n\nBetween the Chinese Revolution and the last quarter of the 20th century, communist rule spread throughout East Asia and much of the [[Third World]] and new [[communist regime]]s became the subject of extensive local and international criticism. Criticisms of the Soviet Union and third world communist regimes have been strongly anchored in scholarship on [[totalitarianism]], which asserts that communist parties maintain themselves in power without the [[Consent of the governed|consent of the populations]] and they rule by means of [[Political repression|repression]], [[secret police]], [[propaganda]] disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, repression of free discussion and criticism, [[mass surveillance]] and [[state terror]]. These studies of totalitarianism influenced Western historiography on communism and Soviet history, particularly the work of [[Robert Conquest]] and [[Richard Pipes]] on [[Stalinism]], the [[Great Purge]], the [[Gulag]] and the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933]].\n\n== Areas of criticism ==\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|see also}}\nCriticisms of [[communist regime]]s have centered on many topics, including their effects on the [[economic development]], [[human rights]], [[foreign policy]], scientific progress and [[natural environment|environmental degradation]] of the countries they rule.\n\nPolitical repression is a topic in many influential works critical of communist rule, including [[Robert Conquest]]'s accounts of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in ''[[The Great Terror]]'' and the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933]] in ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]''; [[Richard Pipes]]' account of the \"[[Red Terror]]\" during the [[Russian Civil War]]; [[R.J. Rummel]]'s work on \"[[democide]]\"; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s account of Stalin's forced labor camps in ''The Gulag Archipelago''; and [[St\u00e9phane Courtois]]' account of executions, forced labor camps and mass starvation in communist regimes as a general category, with particular attention to the Soviet Union under [[Joseph Stalin]] and China under [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nSoviet-style central planning and state ownership has been another topic of criticism of communist rule. Works by economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argue that the economic structures associated with communist rule resulted in economic stagnation. Other topics of criticism of communist rule include foreign policies of \"expansionism\", environmental degradation and the suppression of free cultural expression.\n\n=== Political repression ===\nLarge-scale political repression under communist rule has been the subject of extensive historical research by scholars and activists from a diverse range of perspectives. A number of researchers on this subject are former Eastern bloc communists who become disillusioned with their ruling parties, such as [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] and [[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. Similarly, [[Jung Chang]], one of the authors of ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', was a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] in her youth. Others are disillusioned former Western communists, including several of the authors of ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. [[Robert Conquest]], another former communist, became one of the best-known writers on the Soviet Union following the publication of his influential account of the Great Purge in ''[[The Great Terror]]'', which at first was not well received in some left-leaning circles of Western intellectuals. Following the end of the Cold War, much of the research on this topic has focused on state archives previously classified under communist rule.\n\nThe level of political repression experienced in states under communist rule varied widely between different countries and historical periods. The most rigid censorship was practiced by the Soviet Union under Stalin (1922\u20131953), China under Mao during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976) and the communist regime in [[North Korea]] throughout its rule (1948\u2013present).<ref>{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former). Chapter 9 \u2013 Mass Media and the Arts |work=The Library of Congress. Country Studies |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html|accessdate=October 3, 2005}}</ref> Under Stalin's rule, political repression in the Soviet Union included executions of Great Purge victims and peasants deemed \"[[kulak]]s\" by state authorities; the [[Gulag]] system of forced labor camps; deportations of ethnic minorities; and mass starvations during the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933, caused by either government mismanagement, or by some accounts, caused deliberately. ''The Black Book of Communism'' also details the mass starvations resulting from [[Great Leap Forward]] in China and the [[Killing Fields]] in [[Cambodia]].\n\nAlthough political repression in the Soviet Union was far more extensive and severe in its methods under Stalin's rule than in any other period, authors such as [[Richard Pipes]], [[Orlando Figes]] and works such as the ''Black Book of Communism'' argue that a reign of terror began within Russia under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] immediately after the [[October Revolution]], and continued by the [[Red Army]] and the [[Cheka]] over the country during the [[Russian Civil War]]. It included summary executions of hundreds of thousands of \"class enemies\" by Cheka; the development of the system of labor camps, which would later lay the foundation for the Gulags; and a policy of food requisitioning during the civil war, which was partially responsible for a famine causing three to ten million deaths.<ref>Pipes, Richard (1990) The Russian Revolution 1899\u20131919.

His accounts stress cases in which children of former imperial officers and peasants were held as hostages and sometimes shot during the civil war. His account of the Second World War highlights cases in which the children of soldiers who had surrendered were the victims of state reprisal. Some children, Yakovlev notes, followed their parents to the Gulags, suffering an especially high mortality rate. According to Yakovlev, in 1954 there were 884,057 \"specially resettled\" children under the age of sixteen. Others were placed in special orphanages run by the secret police in order to be reeducated, often losing even their names, and were considered socially dangerous as adults.<ref>Yakovlev, Alexander (2004).

In the case of North Korea, the [[North Korean cult of personality|personality cult of Kim Il-sung]] was associated with inherited leadership, with the succession of Kim's son [[Kim Jong-il]] in 1994 and grandson [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2011. Cuban communists have also been criticized for planning an inherited leadership, with the succession of [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] following his brother's illness in mid-2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5234790.stm|title=Profile: Raul Castro|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of movement ===\n[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed in 1961 to stop emigration from [[East Berlin|East]] to [[West Berlin]] and in the last phase of the wall's development the \"death strip\" between fence and concrete wall gave guards a clear shot at would-be escapees from the East]]\nIn the literature on communist rule, many anticommunists have asserted that communist regimes tend to impose harsh restrictions on the [[freedom of movement]]. These restrictions, they argue, are meant to stem the possibility of mass emigration, which threatens to offer evidence pointing to widespread popular dissatisfaction with their rule.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1961, 2.75 million East Germans moved to West Germany. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 around 200,000 people moved to Austria as the Hungarian-Austrian border temporarily opened. From 1948 to 1953 hundreds of thousands of North Koreans moved to the South, stopped only when emigration was clamped down after the [[Korean War]].\n\nIn [[Cuba]], 50,000 middle-class Cubans left between 1959 and 1961 after the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the breakdown of Cuban-American relations. Following a period of repressive measures by the Cuban government in the late 1960s and 1970s, Cuba allowed for mass emigration of dissatisfied citizens, a policy that resulted in the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980, which led to a drop in emigration rates during the later months. In the 1990s, the economic crisis known as the [[Special Period]] coupled with the United States' tightening of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] led to desperate attempts to leave the island on ''balsas'' (rafts, tires and makeshift vessels).<ref name=\"Cuba's Revolution and Exodus\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol5no2/pedraza.htm |title=Cuba's Revolution and Exodus |access-date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211105621/http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol5no2/pedraza.htm |archive-date=2007-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many Cubans currently continue attempts to emigrate to the United States In total, according to some estimates, more than 1 million people have left Cuba, around 10% of the population.<ref name=\"Cuba's Revolution and Exodus\"/> Between 1971 and 1998, 547,000 Cubans emigrated to the United States alongside 700,000 neighboring Dominicans, 335,000 Haitians and 485,000 Jamaicans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.focal.ca/pdf/migration_caribbean.pdf |title=Diaspora, Migration and development |access-date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215074116/http://www.focal.ca/pdf/migration_caribbean.pdf |archive-date=2007-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 1966, immigration to the United States was governed by the 1966 Cuban adjustment act, a United States law that applies solely to Cubans.

Another large group of refugees left Cambodia and Laos.\n\nRestrictions on emigration from states ruled by communist parties received extensive publicity. In the West, the [[Berlin wall]] emerged as a symbol of such restrictions. During the Berlin Wall's existence, sixty thousand people unsuccessfully attempted to emigrate illegally from East Germany and received jail terms for such actions; there were around five thousand successful escapes into West Berlin; and 239 people were killed trying to cross.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Concrete Curtain: The Life and Death of the Berlin Wall |url=http://www.wall-berlin.org/gb/berlin.htm|accessdate=October 25, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051023014718/http://www.wall-berlin.org/gb/berlin.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = October 23, 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Albania]] and [[North Korea]] perhaps imposed the most extreme restrictions on emigration. From most other communist regimes, legal emigration was always possible, though often so difficult that attempted emigrants would risk their lives in order to emigrate. Some of these states relaxed emigration laws significantly from the 1960s onwards. Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens emigrated legally every year during the 1970s.<ref>Szymanski, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Chinese government takes these restrictions even further by restriction of movement within their own borders. Workers in rural areas must obtain permission to obtain work at factories within urban areas. Many rural citizens, especially young men, facing lack of education and other services that are provided free of charge to people living in cities and urban areas, choose to obtain under-the-table work in urban areas where there are labor shortages, leading to an illegal immigration problem within the country. These restrictions are not for the political reasons other regimes have used, but to maintain the central government planned economy and \"caste\" system that seeks to retain the knowledge and skills needed in different fields of the economy: Agriculture, Industry, Fishing, etc. One belief is that China is trying to reduce overpopulation of urban areas and avoid the loss of specialized skills usually passed from generation to generation in the traditional fields.\n\n=== International politics and relations ===\n==== Imperialism ====\nAs an ideology, [[Marxism-Leninism]] stresses militant opposition to [[imperialism]]. Vladimir Lenin considered imperialism \"the highest stage of capitalism\" and in 1917 made declarations of the unconditional right of [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] for the national minorities of Russia. Later, during the Cold War, communist states exercised imperialism by giving military assistance and in some cases intervening directly on behalf of Communist movements that were fighting for control, particularly in Asia and Africa.\n\nWestern critics accused the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China of practicing imperialism themselves, and communist condemnations of Western imperialism hypocritical. The attack on and restoration of Moscow's control of countries that had been under the rule of the tsarist empire, but briefly formed newly independent states in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War (including Armenia, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]), have been condemned as examples of Soviet imperialism.<ref>*Pipes, Richard (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0679761845}}. pp. 141\u201366.</ref> Similarly, Stalin's forced reassertion of Moscow's rule of the [[Baltic states]] in World War II has been condemned as Soviet imperialism. Western critics accused Stalin of creating [[satellite state]]s in Eastern Europe after the end of World War II. Western critics also condemned the intervention of Soviet forces during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the [[Prague Spring]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]] as aggression against popular uprisings. Maoists argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade ([[social imperialism]]). China's reassertion of central control over territories on the frontiers of the [[Qing dynasty]], particularly Tibet, has also been condemned as imperialistic by some.\n\n==== World War II ====\nAccording to Richard Pipes, the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for [[World War II]]. Pipes argues that both [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a \"genius\". According to Pipes, Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to [[Proletarian internationalism|assert Soviet power internationally]]. Before Hitler took power, Stalin allowed the testing and production of German weapons that were forbidden by the [[Versailles Treaty]] to occur on Soviet territory. Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitler's rule began in 1933. During the 1932 German elections, for instance, he forbade the German Communists from collaborating with the Social Democrats.

Some of the Gulag camps were located in very harsh environments, such as [[Siberia]], which resulted in the death of a significant fraction of inmates before they could complete their prison terms. Officially, the Gulag was shut down in 1960, though they remained de facto in action for some time after.\n\nMany deaths were also caused by involuntary [[deportations]] of entire ethnic groups. (''see'' [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]]). Many [[Prisoners of War]] taken during World War II were not released as the war ended and died in the Gulags. Many German civilians died as a result of atrocities committed by the Soviet army (''see'' [[Evacuation of East Prussia]]) and due to the policy of [[ethnic cleansing]] of Germans from the territories they lost due to the war (see [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]).\n\nNorth Korea continues to maintain a network of [[Prisons in North Korea|prison and labor camps]] that imprison an estimated 200,000 people.

[[Cornell University Press]]. pp. 91\u2013151. {{ISBN|0801472733}}</ref> and [[R.J. Rummel]] have argued that communist regimes were responsible for tens or even hundreds of millions of deaths. These deaths mostly occurred under the rule of Stalin and Mao, therefore these particular periods of communist rule in Russia and China receive considerable attention in ''The Black Book of Communism'', though other communist regimes have also caused high number of deaths, not least the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in Cambodia, which is often acclaimed to have killed more of its citizens than any other in history.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThese accounts often divide their death toll estimates into two categories:\n# Executions of people who had received the death penalty for various charges, or deaths that occurred in prison.\n# Deaths that were not caused directly by the regime (the people in question were not executed and did not die in prison), but are considered to have died as an indirect result of state or communist party policies. Courtois, among others, argues that most victims of communist rule fell in this category, which is often the subject of considerable controversy.\n\nIn most communist states, the death penalty was a legal form of punishment for most of their existence, with a few exceptions. The Soviet Union, for example, formally abolished the death penalty between 1947 and 1950, though this did nothing to curb executions and acts of genocide.<ref>{{cite web |title=On the Abolition of the Death Penalty |work=Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, 26 May 1947 |url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/50uk-ab-dp-e.html |accessdate=January 8, 2006}}<br>{{cite web |title=On the Employment of the Death Penalty to Traitors of the Motherland, Spies, and Saboteur-Subversives |work=Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, 12 January 1950 |url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/50uk-dp-sp-e.html |accessdate=January 8, 2006}}</ref> Critics argue that many of the convicted prisoners executed by authorities under communist rule were not criminals, but political dissidents. Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in the late 1930s (from roughly 1936\u20131938) is given as the most prominent example of the hypothesis.<ref>Conquest, Robert (1991) ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment''. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0195071328}}.</ref>\n\nWith regard to deaths not caused directly by state or party authorities, ''The Black Book of Communism'' points to famine and war as the indirect causes of what they see as deaths for which communist regimes were responsible. In this sense, the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 and the [[Great Leap Forward]] are often described as man-made famines. These two events alone killed a majority of the people seen as victims of communist states by estimates such as Courtois'. Courtois also blames [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s regime in Ethiopia for having exacerbated the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|1983\u20131985 famine]] by imposing unreasonable political and economic burdens on the population.\n\n==== Estimates ====\nThe authors of ''The Black Book of Communism'', R.J. Rummel, Norman Davies and others have attempted to give estimates of the total number of deaths for which communist rule of a particular state in a particular period was responsible, or the total for all states under communist rule. The question is complicated by the lack of hard data and by biases inherent in any estimation.\n\nThe number of people killed under Joseph Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union by 1939 has been estimated as 3.5\u20138 million by G.

[[The Spectator]], 25 September 2010.</ref>\n\nThese estimates are the three highest numbers of victims blamed on communism by any notable study. However, the totals that include research by Wiezhi, Heidenrich, Glasser, Possony, Ponton, Tsaplin and Nove do not include other periods of time beyond Stalin or Mao's rule, thus it may possible when including other communist states to reach higher totals.\n\nIn a 25 January 2006 [[Council of Europe resolution 1481|resolution]] condemning the crimes of communist regimes, the [[Council of Europe]] cited the 94 million total reached by the authors of the ''Black Book of Communism''.\n\nExplanations have been offered for the discrepancies in the number of estimated victims of communist regimes:\n* First, all these numbers are estimates derived from incomplete data. Researchers often have to extrapolate and interpret available information in order to arrive at their final numbers.\n* Second, different researchers work with different definitions of what it means to be killed by a regime. As noted above, the vast majority of victims of communist regimes did not die as a result of direct government orders, but as an indirect result of state policy. There is no agreement on the question of whether communist regimes should be held responsible for their deaths and if so, to what degree. The low estimates may count only executions and labor camp deaths as instances of killings by communist regimes while the high estimates may be based on the argument that communist regimes were responsible for all deaths resulting from famine or war.\n* Some of the writers make special distinction for Stalin and Mao, who all agree are responsible for the most extensive pattern of severe crimes against humanity, but include little to no statistics on losses of life after their rule.\n* Another reason is sources available at the time of writing. More recent researchers have access to many of the official archives of communist regimes in East Europe and Soviet Union. However, in Russia many of archives for the period after Stalin's death are still closed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol8/Zhukov.html|title=Russia's Archives: Opportunities & Restrictions|journal=Perspective|volume=8|issue=3|page=5|date=January\u2013February 1998|authorlink=Yuri Zhukov (historian)|first=Yuri N.|last=Zhukov}}.</ref>\n* Finally, this is a highly politically charged field, with nearly all researchers having been accused of a pro- or anti-communist bias at one time or another.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\nBoth critics and supporters of communist rule often make comparisons between the economic development of countries under communist rule and noncommunist countries, with the intention of certain economic structures are superior to the other. All such comparisons are open to challenge, both on the comparability of the states involved and the statistics being used for comparison. No two countries are identical, which makes comparisons regarding later economic development difficult; Western Europe was more developed and industrialized than Eastern Europe long before the Cold War; World War II damaged the economies of some countries more than others; and East Germany had much of its industry dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union for war reparations.\n\nAdvocates of Soviet-style economic planning have claimed the system has in certain instances produced dramatic advances, including rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union, especially during the 1930s. Critics of Soviet economic planning, in response, assert that new research shows that the Soviet figures were partly fabricated, especially those showing extremely high growth in the Stalin era. Growth was impressive in the 1950s and 1960s, in some estimates much higher than during the 1930s, but later declined and according to some estimates became negative in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steele, Charles N|title=The Soviet Experiment: Lessons for Development|year=2002|version=in Morris, J.(ed.), Sustainable Development.

Some reject all comparisons altogether, noting that the communist states started out with economies that were generally much less developed to begin with.<ref name=\"Ofer, Gur 1988\"/>\n\n=== Social development ===\nStarting with the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Soviet leaders pursued a strategy of economic development concentrating the country's economic resources on [[heavy industry]] and [[defense (military)|defense]] rather than on [[consumer goods in the USSR|consumer goods]]. This strategy was later adopted in varying degrees by communist leaders in Eastern Europe and the Third World. For many Western critics of communist strategies of economic development, the unavailability of consumer goods common in the West in the Soviet Union was a case in point of how communist rule resulted in lower [[standard of living|standards of living]].\n\nThe allegation that communist rule resulted in lower standards of living sharply contrasted with communist arguments boasting of the achievements of the social and cultural programs of the Soviet Union and other communist states. For instance, Soviet leaders boasted of guaranteed employment, subsidized food and clothing, free health care, free child care and free education. Soviet leaders also touted early advances in women's equality, particularly in [[Islamic]] areas of Soviet Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Massell, Gregory J. |title=The Surrogate Proletariat: Moslem Women and Revolutionary Strategies in Soviet Central Asia, 1919\u20131929 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1974 |isbn=978-0691075624}}</ref> Eastern European communists often touted high levels of literacy in comparison with many parts of the developing world.

Horowitz claimed that in the 1980s rationing of meat and sugar was common in the Soviet Union. Horowitz cited studies suggesting the average intake of [[red meat]] for a Soviet citizen was half of what it had been for a subject of the tsar in 1913, that blacks under [[apartheid]] in South Africa owned more cars per capita and that the average welfare mother in the United States received more income in a month than the average Soviet worker could earn in a year. According to Horowitz, the only area of consumption in which the Soviets excelled was the ingestion of [[hard liquor]]. Horowitz also noted that two-thirds of the households had no hot water and a third had no running water at all. Horowitz cited the government newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'', noting a typical working-class family of four was forced to live for eight years in a single eight by eight foot room before marginally better accommodation became available. In his discussion of the Soviet housing shortage, Horowitz stated that the shortage was so acute that at all times 17 percent of Soviet families had to be physically separated for want of adequate space. A third of the hospitals had no running water and the bribery of doctors and nurses to get decent medical attention and even amenities like blankets in Soviet hospitals was not only common, but routine. In his discussion of Soviet education, Horowitz stated that only 15 percent of Soviet youth were able to attend institutions of higher learning compared to 34 percent in the United States.<ref name=\"Horowitz, David 2000\"/> However, large segments of citizens of many former communist today states say that the standard of living has fallen since the end of the Cold War,<ref name=\"Czech News Agency\">{{cite news|title=Poll: Many Czechs say they had better life under Communism|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2011/11/21/poll-many-czechs-say-they-had-better-life-under-communism|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Prague Daily Monitor|date=21 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421190107/http://praguemonitor.com/2011/11/21/poll-many-czechs-say-they-had-better-life-under-communism|archive-date=21 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Pew Research Center\">{{cite web|last=Wikes|first=Richard|title=Hungary Dissatisfied with Democracy, but Not its Ideals|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1554/hungary-economic-discontent-democracy-communism|accessdate=13 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083458/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1554/hungary-economic-discontent-democracy-communism|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> with majorities of citizens in the former East Germany and Romania were polled as saying that life was better under Communism.<ref name=\"Balkan Analysis\">{{cite web|last=Dragomir|first=Elena|title=In Romania, Opinion polls show nostalgia for Communism|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Spiegel Online International\">{{cite news|last=Bonstein|first=Julia|title=Majority of Eastern Germans Feel Life Better under Communism|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,634122,00.html|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=August 3, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of living standards, economist [[Michael Ellman]] asserts that in international comparisons state socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy.<ref>[[Michael Ellman]] (2014).

In the case of the Soviet Union, these criticisms often deal with the preferential treatment afforded to [[socialist realism]]. Other criticisms center on the large-scale cultural experiments of certain communist regimes. In Romania, the historical center of Bucharest was demolished and the whole city was redesigned between 1977 and 1989. In the Soviet Union, hundreds of churches were demolished or converted to secular purposes during the 1920s and 1930s. In China, the [[Cultural Revolution]] sought to give all artistic expression a 'proletarian' content and destroyed much older material lacking this.<ref>Introduction, The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674076087}}.</ref> Advocates of these policies promised to create a new culture that would be superior to the old while critics argue that such policies represented an unjustifiable destruction of the cultural heritage of humanity.\n\nThere is a well-known literature focusing on the role of the falsification of images in the Soviet Union under Stalin. In ''The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs in Stalin's Russia'', [[David King (graphic designer)|David King]] writes: \"So much falsification took place during the Stalin years that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/king-commissar.html The Commissar Vanishes] ''New York Times'', 1997</ref> Under Stalin, historical documents were often the subject of revisionism and forgery, intended to change public perception of certain important people and events. For example, the pivotal role played by [[Leon Trotsky]] in the Russian Revolution and Civil War was almost entirely erased from official historical records after Trotsky became the leader of a Communist faction that opposed Stalin's rule.\n\nThe emphasis on the \"[[hard sciences]]\" of the Soviet Union has been criticized.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former).

[[Lysenkoism]] and [[Japhetic theory (linguistics)|Japhetic theory]] were promoted for brief periods of time in [[biology]] and [[linguistics]] respectively, despite having no scientific merit. Research into [[genetics]] was restricted because [[Nazism|Nazi]] use of [[eugenics]] had prompted the Soviet Union to label genetics a \"fascist science\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalinist Science|last=Krementsov|first=Nikolai|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=60}}</ref> Research was also suppressed in [[cybernetics]], [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] and even [[organic chemistry]] (see [[suppressed research in the Soviet Union]])\n\nSoviet technology in many sectors lagged Western technology. Exceptions include areas like the [[Soviet space program]] and military technology where occasionally Communist technology was more advanced due to a massive concentration of research resources. According to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], much of the technology in the Communist states consisted simply of copies of Western products that had been legally purchased or gained through a massive espionage program. Some even say that stricter Western control of the export of technology through the [[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]] and providing defective technology to Communist agents after the discovery of the [[Farewell Dossier]] contributed to the fall of Communism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis, Christopher |title=The Defence Sector in the Economy of a Declining Superpower: Soviet Union and Russia, 1965\u20132000 |publisher=University of Oxford |year=2000 |version=Forthcoming Article in the Journal Defence and Peace Economics Draft (8/6/00) |url=http://www.econ.ox.ac.uk/Research/WP/PDF/paper008.pdf |access-date=2006-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526094538/http://www.econ.ox.ac.uk/Research/WP/PDF/paper008.pdf |archive-date=2006-05-26 |url-status=dead }}\n{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former).

One example is the gradual disappearance of the [[Aral Sea]] and a similar diminishing of the [[Caspian Sea]] because of the diversion of the rivers that fed them. Another is the pollution of the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the unique freshwater environment of [[Lake Baikal]]. Many of the rivers were polluted and several, like the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder]] rivers in Poland, were virtually ecologically dead. Over 70 percent of the surface water in the Soviet Union was polluted. In 1988, only 30 percent of the sewage in the Soviet Union was treated properly. Established health standards for [[air pollution]] was exceeded by ten times or more in 103 cities in the Soviet Union in 1988. The air pollution problem was even more severe in Eastern Europe. It caused a rapid growth in [[lung cancer]], forest die-back and damage to buildings and cultural heritages. According to official sources, 58 percent of total agricultural land of the former Soviet Union was affected by [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[erosion]], [[acidity]], or [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]]. Nuclear waste was dumped in the [[Sea of Japan]], the Arctic Ocean and in locations in the Far East.

Many communists disagree with many of the actions undertaken by ruling Communist parties during the 20th century.\n\nElements of the left opposed to Bolshevik plans before they were put into practice included the revisionist Marxists, such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], who denied the necessity of a revolution. [[anarchism|Anarchists]] (who had differed from Marx and his followers since the split in the [[First International]]), many of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the Marxist [[Mensheviks]] supported the overthrow of the [[tsar]], but vigorously opposed the seizure of power by Lenin and the [[Bolshevik]]s.\n\nCriticisms of Communist rule from the left continued after the creation of the Soviet state. The anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]] led the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] against the Bolsheviks during the [[Russian Civil War]] and the Socialist Revolutionary [[Fanya Kaplan]] tried to assassinate Lenin. [[Bertrand Russell]] visited Russia in 1920 and regarded the Bolsheviks as intelligent, but clueless and planless. In her books about Soviet Russia after the revolution, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'' and ''[[My Further Disillusionment in Russia]]'', [[Emma Goldman]] condemned the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] as a \"massacre\". Eventually, the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] broke with the Bolsheviks.\n\n=== By anti-revisionists ===\n[[Anti-revisionist]]s (which includes radical [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] factions, [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaists]] and [[Maoism|Maoists]]) criticize the rule of the communist states by claiming that they were [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] states ruled by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].<ref name=\"BillBland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oneparty.co.uk/html/book/ussrmenu.html|title=Restoration of Capitalism in the Soviet Union|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/Mao/CSE58.html|title=A Critique of Soviet Economics|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> Though the periods and countries defined as state capitalist or revisionist varies among different ideologies and parties, all of them accept that the Soviet Union was socialist during Stalin's time.

Being the engineer that he was, Bordiga displayed a kind of theoretical rigidity which was both exasperating and effective in allowing him to see things differently. He wanted to show how capitalist social relations existed in the [[kolkhoz]] and in the [[sovkhoz]], one a cooperative farm and the other the straight wage-labor state farm. He emphasized how much of agrarian production depended on the small privately owned plots (he was writing in 1950) and predicted quite accurately the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914. In Bordiga's conception, Stalin and later Mao, Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara were \"great romantic revolutionaries\" in the 19th century sense, i.e. bourgeois revolutionaries. He felt that the Stalinist regimes that came into existence after 1945 were just extending the bourgeois revolution, i.e. the expropriation of the [[Prussian Junker]] class by the Red Army through their agrarian policies and through the development of the productive forces.\n\n=== By Trotskyists ===\nAfter the split between [[Leon Trotsky]] and Stalin, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] have argued that Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a bureaucratic and repressive one-party state and that all subsequent Communist states ultimately followed a similar path because they copied [[Stalinism]]. There are various terms used by Trotskyists to define such states, such as \"[[degenerated workers' state]]\" and \"[[deformed workers' state]]\", \"[[state capitalist]]\" or \"[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic collectivist]]\". While Trotskyists are Leninists, there are other Marxists who reject Leninism entirely, arguing, for example, that the Leninist principle of [[democratic centralism]] was the source of the Soviet Union's slide away from communism. [[Maoism|Maoists]] view the Soviet Union and most of its satellites as \"state capitalist\" as a result of [[destalinization]] and some of them also view modern China in this light.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anti-capitalism]]\n* [[Anti-communism]]\n* [[Anti-Leninism]]\n* [[Anti-Stalinist left]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''\n* [[Communist state]]\n* [[Criticism of capitalism]]\n* [[Criticism of Marxism]]\n* [[Criticism of socialism]]\n* [[Criticism of the United States]]\n* [[Dictatorship]]\n* [[Democracy]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Left communism]]\n* [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Mass killings under communist regimes]]\n* [[One-party state]]\n* [[Red fascism]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Totalitarianism]]\n* [[Victims of Communism Memorial]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Applebaum, Anne, [[Gulag: A History]], Broadway Books, 2003, hardcover, 720 pages, {{ISBN|0767900561}}\n* Applebaum, Anne (foreword) and [[Paul Hollander|Hollander, Paul]] (2006) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130328020335/http://www.isi.org/books/content/384intro.pdf introduction] and editor) ''From the Gulag to the Killing Fields: Personal Accounts of Political Violence and Repression in Communist States.''

During the first [[Red Scare]] in the United States, the takeover of Russia by the communist [[Bolshevik]]s was considered by many a threat to [[free market]]s, [[religious freedom]] and liberal democracy. Meanwhile, under the tutelage of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] the only party permitted by the [[constitution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union constitution]], state institutions were intimately entwined with those of the party. By the late 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated the regime's control over the country's economy and society through a system of [[economic planning]] and [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]].\n\nBetween the Russian Revolution and the Second World War, Soviet-style communist rule only spread to one state that was not later incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1924, communist rule was established in neighboring Mongolia, a traditional outpost of Russian influence bordering the Siberian region. However, throughout much of Europe and the Americas criticism of the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet regime among [[anticommunism|anticommunists]] continued unabated. After the end of World War II, Soviet Union took control over the territories reached by the [[Red Army]], establishing what later became known as [[Eastern Bloc]]. Following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]], the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].\n\nBetween the Chinese Revolution and the last quarter of the 20th century, communist rule spread throughout East Asia and much of the [[Third World]] and new [[communist regime]]s became the subject of extensive local and international criticism. Criticisms of the Soviet Union and third world communist regimes have been strongly anchored in scholarship on [[totalitarianism]], which asserts that communist parties maintain themselves in power without the [[Consent of the governed|consent of the populations]] and they rule by means of [[Political repression|repression]], [[secret police]], [[propaganda]] disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, repression of free discussion and criticism, [[mass surveillance]] and [[state terror]]. These studies of totalitarianism influenced Western historiography on communism and Soviet history, particularly the work of [[Robert Conquest]] and [[Richard Pipes]] on [[Stalinism]], the [[Great Purge]], the [[Gulag]] and the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933]].\n\n== Areas of criticism ==\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|see also}}\nCriticisms of [[communist regime]]s have centered on many topics, including their effects on the [[economic development]], [[human rights]], [[foreign policy]], scientific progress and [[natural environment|environmental degradation]] of the countries they rule.\n\nPolitical repression is a topic in many influential works critical of communist rule, including [[Robert Conquest]]'s accounts of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in ''[[The Great Terror]]'' and the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933]] in ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]''; [[Richard Pipes]]' account of the \"[[Red Terror]]\" during the [[Russian Civil War]]; [[R.J. Rummel]]'s work on \"[[democide]]\"; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s account of Stalin's forced labor camps in ''The Gulag Archipelago''; and [[St\u00e9phane Courtois]]' account of executions, forced labor camps and mass starvation in communist regimes as a general category, with particular attention to the Soviet Union under [[Joseph Stalin]] and China under [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nSoviet-style central planning and state ownership has been another topic of criticism of communist rule. Works by economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argue that the economic structures associated with communist rule resulted in economic stagnation. Other topics of criticism of communist rule include foreign policies of \"expansionism\", environmental degradation and the suppression of free cultural expression.\n\n=== Political repression ===\nLarge-scale political repression under communist rule has been the subject of extensive historical research by scholars and activists from a diverse range of perspectives. A number of researchers on this subject are former Eastern bloc communists who become disillusioned with their ruling parties, such as [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] and [[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. Similarly, [[Jung Chang]], one of the authors of ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', was a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] in her youth. Others are disillusioned former Western communists, including several of the authors of ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. [[Robert Conquest]], another former communist, became one of the best-known writers on the Soviet Union following the publication of his influential account of the Great Purge in ''[[The Great Terror]]'', which at first was not well received in some left-leaning circles of Western intellectuals. Following the end of the Cold War, much of the research on this topic has focused on state archives previously classified under communist rule.\n\nThe level of political repression experienced in states under communist rule varied widely between different countries and historical periods. The most rigid censorship was practiced by the Soviet Union under Stalin (1922\u20131953), China under Mao during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976) and the communist regime in [[North Korea]] throughout its rule (1948\u2013present).<ref>{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former). Chapter 9 \u2013 Mass Media and the Arts |work=The Library of Congress. Country Studies |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html|accessdate=October 3, 2005}}</ref> Under Stalin's rule, political repression in the Soviet Union included executions of Great Purge victims and peasants deemed \"[[kulak]]s\" by state authorities; the [[Gulag]] system of forced labor camps; deportations of ethnic minorities; and mass starvations during the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933, caused by either government mismanagement, or by some accounts, caused deliberately. ''The Black Book of Communism'' also details the mass starvations resulting from [[Great Leap Forward]] in China and the [[Killing Fields]] in [[Cambodia]].\n\nAlthough political repression in the Soviet Union was far more extensive and severe in its methods under Stalin's rule than in any other period, authors such as [[Richard Pipes]], [[Orlando Figes]] and works such as the ''Black Book of Communism'' argue that a reign of terror began within Russia under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] immediately after the [[October Revolution]], and continued by the [[Red Army]] and the [[Cheka]] over the country during the [[Russian Civil War]]. It included summary executions of hundreds of thousands of \"class enemies\" by Cheka; the development of the system of labor camps, which would later lay the foundation for the Gulags; and a policy of food requisitioning during the civil war, which was partially responsible for a famine causing three to ten million deaths.<ref>Pipes, Richard (1990) The Russian Revolution 1899\u20131919.

His accounts stress cases in which children of former imperial officers and peasants were held as hostages and sometimes shot during the civil war. His account of the Second World War highlights cases in which the children of soldiers who had surrendered were the victims of state reprisal. Some children, Yakovlev notes, followed their parents to the Gulags, suffering an especially high mortality rate. According to Yakovlev, in 1954 there were 884,057 \"specially resettled\" children under the age of sixteen. Others were placed in special orphanages run by the secret police in order to be reeducated, often losing even their names, and were considered socially dangerous as adults.<ref>Yakovlev, Alexander (2004).

In the case of North Korea, the [[North Korean cult of personality|personality cult of Kim Il-sung]] was associated with inherited leadership, with the succession of Kim's son [[Kim Jong-il]] in 1994 and grandson [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2011. Cuban communists have also been criticized for planning an inherited leadership, with the succession of [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] following his brother's illness in mid-2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5234790.stm|title=Profile: Raul Castro|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of movement ===\n[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed in 1961 to stop emigration from [[East Berlin|East]] to [[West Berlin]] and in the last phase of the wall's development the \"death strip\" between fence and concrete wall gave guards a clear shot at would-be escapees from the East]]\nIn the literature on communist rule, many anticommunists have asserted that communist regimes tend to impose harsh restrictions on the [[freedom of movement]]. These restrictions, they argue, are meant to stem the possibility of mass emigration, which threatens to offer evidence pointing to widespread popular dissatisfaction with their rule.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1961, 2.75 million East Germans moved to West Germany. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 around 200,000 people moved to Austria as the Hungarian-Austrian border temporarily opened. From 1948 to 1953 hundreds of thousands of North Koreans moved to the South, stopped only when emigration was clamped down after the [[Korean War]].\n\nIn [[Cuba]], 50,000 middle-class Cubans left between 1959 and 1961 after the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the breakdown of Cuban-American relations. Following a period of repressive measures by the Cuban government in the late 1960s and 1970s, Cuba allowed for mass emigration of dissatisfied citizens, a policy that resulted in the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980, which led to a drop in emigration rates during the later months. In the 1990s, the economic crisis known as the [[Special Period]] coupled with the United States' tightening of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] led to desperate attempts to leave the island on ''balsas'' (rafts, tires and makeshift vessels).<ref name=\"Cuba's Revolution and Exodus\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol5no2/pedraza.htm |title=Cuba's Revolution and Exodus |access-date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211105621/http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol5no2/pedraza.htm |archive-date=2007-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many Cubans currently continue attempts to emigrate to the United States In total, according to some estimates, more than 1 million people have left Cuba, around 10% of the population.<ref name=\"Cuba's Revolution and Exodus\"/> Between 1971 and 1998, 547,000 Cubans emigrated to the United States alongside 700,000 neighboring Dominicans, 335,000 Haitians and 485,000 Jamaicans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.focal.ca/pdf/migration_caribbean.pdf |title=Diaspora, Migration and development |access-date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215074116/http://www.focal.ca/pdf/migration_caribbean.pdf |archive-date=2007-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 1966, immigration to the United States was governed by the 1966 Cuban adjustment act, a United States law that applies solely to Cubans.

Another large group of refugees left Cambodia and Laos.\n\nRestrictions on emigration from states ruled by communist parties received extensive publicity. In the West, the [[Berlin wall]] emerged as a symbol of such restrictions. During the Berlin Wall's existence, sixty thousand people unsuccessfully attempted to emigrate illegally from East Germany and received jail terms for such actions; there were around five thousand successful escapes into West Berlin; and 239 people were killed trying to cross.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Concrete Curtain: The Life and Death of the Berlin Wall |url=http://www.wall-berlin.org/gb/berlin.htm|accessdate=October 25, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051023014718/http://www.wall-berlin.org/gb/berlin.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = October 23, 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Albania]] and [[North Korea]] perhaps imposed the most extreme restrictions on emigration. From most other communist regimes, legal emigration was always possible, though often so difficult that attempted emigrants would risk their lives in order to emigrate. Some of these states relaxed emigration laws significantly from the 1960s onwards. Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens emigrated legally every year during the 1970s.<ref>Szymanski, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Chinese government takes these restrictions even further by restriction of movement within their own borders. Workers in rural areas must obtain permission to obtain work at factories within urban areas. Many rural citizens, especially young men, facing lack of education and other services that are provided free of charge to people living in cities and urban areas, choose to obtain under-the-table work in urban areas where there are labor shortages, leading to an illegal immigration problem within the country. These restrictions are not for the political reasons other regimes have used, but to maintain the central government planned economy and \"caste\" system that seeks to retain the knowledge and skills needed in different fields of the economy: Agriculture, Industry, Fishing, etc. One belief is that China is trying to reduce overpopulation of urban areas and avoid the loss of specialized skills usually passed from generation to generation in the traditional fields.\n\n=== International politics and relations ===\n==== Imperialism ====\nAs an ideology, [[Marxism-Leninism]] stresses militant opposition to [[imperialism]]. Vladimir Lenin considered imperialism \"the highest stage of capitalism\" and in 1917 made declarations of the unconditional right of [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] for the national minorities of Russia. Later, during the Cold War, communist states exercised imperialism by giving military assistance and in some cases intervening directly on behalf of Communist movements that were fighting for control, particularly in Asia and Africa.\n\nWestern critics accused the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China of practicing imperialism themselves, and communist condemnations of Western imperialism hypocritical. The attack on and restoration of Moscow's control of countries that had been under the rule of the tsarist empire, but briefly formed newly independent states in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War (including Armenia, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]), have been condemned as examples of Soviet imperialism.<ref>*Pipes, Richard (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0679761845}}. pp. 141\u201366.</ref> Similarly, Stalin's forced reassertion of Moscow's rule of the [[Baltic states]] in World War II has been condemned as Soviet imperialism. Western critics accused Stalin of creating [[satellite state]]s in Eastern Europe after the end of World War II. Western critics also condemned the intervention of Soviet forces during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the [[Prague Spring]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]] as aggression against popular uprisings. Maoists argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade ([[social imperialism]]). China's reassertion of central control over territories on the frontiers of the [[Qing dynasty]], particularly Tibet, has also been condemned as imperialistic by some.\n\n==== World War II ====\nAccording to Richard Pipes, the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for [[World War II]]. Pipes argues that both [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a \"genius\". According to Pipes, Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to [[Proletarian internationalism|assert Soviet power internationally]]. Before Hitler took power, Stalin allowed the testing and production of German weapons that were forbidden by the [[Versailles Treaty]] to occur on Soviet territory. Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitler's rule began in 1933. During the 1932 German elections, for instance, he forbade the German Communists from collaborating with the Social Democrats. These parties together gained more votes than Hitler and some have later surmised could have prevented him from becoming Chancellor.<ref>Pipes, Richard (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson. {{ISBN|0297646885}} pp. 74\u201376, 96, 103\u201309</ref>\n\n==== Support of terrorism ====\nSome states under communist rule have been criticized for directly supporting [[terrorism|terrorist]] groups, such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the [[Red Army Faction]] and the [[Japanese Red Army]].<ref>Courtois, Stephane; Werth, Nicolas; Panne, Jean-Louis; Paczkowski, Andrzej; Bartosek, Karel; Margolin, Jean-Louis & Kramer, Mark (1999).

Chapter 18</ref> North Korea has been implicated in terrorist acts such as [[Korean Air Flight 858]].\n\n=== Forced labor and deportations ===\nA number of communist states also held [[forced labor]] as a legal form of punishment for certain periods of time and again critics of these policies assert that many of those sentenced to forced labor camps such as the [[Gulag]] were sent there for political rather than criminal reasons. Some of the Gulag camps were located in very harsh environments, such as [[Siberia]], which resulted in the death of a significant fraction of inmates before they could complete their prison terms. Officially, the Gulag was shut down in 1960, though they remained de facto in action for some time after.\n\nMany deaths were also caused by involuntary [[deportations]] of entire ethnic groups. (''see'' [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]]). Many [[Prisoners of War]] taken during World War II were not released as the war ended and died in the Gulags. Many German civilians died as a result of atrocities committed by the Soviet army (''see'' [[Evacuation of East Prussia]]) and due to the policy of [[ethnic cleansing]] of Germans from the territories they lost due to the war (see [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]).\n\nNorth Korea continues to maintain a network of [[Prisons in North Korea|prison and labor camps]] that imprison an estimated 200,000 people. While the country does not regularly deport citizens, there is a system of internal exile and banishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=11855&cataId=nk01500|title=100 Exiled for Foreign Content Exposure|author=Lee Sang Yong|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Mass killings ===\n{{main|Mass killings under communist regimes}}\nScholars such as [[Stephane Courtois]], [[Steven Rosefielde]] (in ''[[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|Red Holocaust]]''), Banjamin Valentino<ref name=\"Valentino91\">Valentino, Benjamin A (2005).

[[Cornell University Press]]. pp. 91\u2013151. {{ISBN|0801472733}}</ref> and [[R.J. Rummel]] have argued that communist regimes were responsible for tens or even hundreds of millions of deaths. These deaths mostly occurred under the rule of Stalin and Mao, therefore these particular periods of communist rule in Russia and China receive considerable attention in ''The Black Book of Communism'', though other communist regimes have also caused high number of deaths, not least the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in Cambodia, which is often acclaimed to have killed more of its citizens than any other in history.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThese accounts often divide their death toll estimates into two categories:\n# Executions of people who had received the death penalty for various charges, or deaths that occurred in prison.\n# Deaths that were not caused directly by the regime (the people in question were not executed and did not die in prison), but are considered to have died as an indirect result of state or communist party policies. Courtois, among others, argues that most victims of communist rule fell in this category, which is often the subject of considerable controversy.\n\nIn most communist states, the death penalty was a legal form of punishment for most of their existence, with a few exceptions. The Soviet Union, for example, formally abolished the death penalty between 1947 and 1950, though this did nothing to curb executions and acts of genocide.<ref>{{cite web |title=On the Abolition of the Death Penalty |work=Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, 26 May 1947 |url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/50uk-ab-dp-e.html |accessdate=January 8, 2006}}<br>{{cite web |title=On the Employment of the Death Penalty to Traitors of the Motherland, Spies, and Saboteur-Subversives |work=Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, 12 January 1950 |url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/50uk-dp-sp-e.html |accessdate=January 8, 2006}}</ref> Critics argue that many of the convicted prisoners executed by authorities under communist rule were not criminals, but political dissidents. Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in the late 1930s (from roughly 1936\u20131938) is given as the most prominent example of the hypothesis.<ref>Conquest, Robert (1991) ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment''. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0195071328}}.</ref>\n\nWith regard to deaths not caused directly by state or party authorities, ''The Black Book of Communism'' points to famine and war as the indirect causes of what they see as deaths for which communist regimes were responsible. In this sense, the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 and the [[Great Leap Forward]] are often described as man-made famines. These two events alone killed a majority of the people seen as victims of communist states by estimates such as Courtois'. Courtois also blames [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s regime in Ethiopia for having exacerbated the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|1983\u20131985 famine]] by imposing unreasonable political and economic burdens on the population.\n\n==== Estimates ====\nThe authors of ''The Black Book of Communism'', R.J. Rummel, Norman Davies and others have attempted to give estimates of the total number of deaths for which communist rule of a particular state in a particular period was responsible, or the total for all states under communist rule. The question is complicated by the lack of hard data and by biases inherent in any estimation.\n\nThe number of people killed under Joseph Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union by 1939 has been estimated as 3.5\u20138 million by G.

Benjamin Valentino claims that between 21 and 70 million deaths are attributable to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and [[Democratic Kampuchea]] alone.<ref name=\"Valentino91\"/>\n\n[[Jasper Becker]], author of ''Hungry Ghosts'', claims that if the death tolls from the famines caused by communist regimes in China, the Soviet Union, Cambodia, North Korea, Ethiopia and Mozambique are added together, the figure could be close to 90 million.<ref>[[Jasper Becker]].

[[The Spectator]], 25 September 2010.</ref>\n\nThese estimates are the three highest numbers of victims blamed on communism by any notable study. However, the totals that include research by Wiezhi, Heidenrich, Glasser, Possony, Ponton, Tsaplin and Nove do not include other periods of time beyond Stalin or Mao's rule, thus it may possible when including other communist states to reach higher totals.\n\nIn a 25 January 2006 [[Council of Europe resolution 1481|resolution]] condemning the crimes of communist regimes, the [[Council of Europe]] cited the 94 million total reached by the authors of the ''Black Book of Communism''.\n\nExplanations have been offered for the discrepancies in the number of estimated victims of communist regimes:\n* First, all these numbers are estimates derived from incomplete data. Researchers often have to extrapolate and interpret available information in order to arrive at their final numbers.\n* Second, different researchers work with different definitions of what it means to be killed by a regime. As noted above, the vast majority of victims of communist regimes did not die as a result of direct government orders, but as an indirect result of state policy. There is no agreement on the question of whether communist regimes should be held responsible for their deaths and if so, to what degree. The low estimates may count only executions and labor camp deaths as instances of killings by communist regimes while the high estimates may be based on the argument that communist regimes were responsible for all deaths resulting from famine or war.\n* Some of the writers make special distinction for Stalin and Mao, who all agree are responsible for the most extensive pattern of severe crimes against humanity, but include little to no statistics on losses of life after their rule.\n* Another reason is sources available at the time of writing. More recent researchers have access to many of the official archives of communist regimes in East Europe and Soviet Union. However, in Russia many of archives for the period after Stalin's death are still closed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol8/Zhukov.html|title=Russia's Archives: Opportunities & Restrictions|journal=Perspective|volume=8|issue=3|page=5|date=January\u2013February 1998|authorlink=Yuri Zhukov (historian)|first=Yuri N.|last=Zhukov}}.</ref>\n* Finally, this is a highly politically charged field, with nearly all researchers having been accused of a pro- or anti-communist bias at one time or another.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\nBoth critics and supporters of communist rule often make comparisons between the economic development of countries under communist rule and noncommunist countries, with the intention of certain economic structures are superior to the other. All such comparisons are open to challenge, both on the comparability of the states involved and the statistics being used for comparison. No two countries are identical, which makes comparisons regarding later economic development difficult; Western Europe was more developed and industrialized than Eastern Europe long before the Cold War; World War II damaged the economies of some countries more than others; and East Germany had much of its industry dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union for war reparations.\n\nAdvocates of Soviet-style economic planning have claimed the system has in certain instances produced dramatic advances, including rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union, especially during the 1930s. Critics of Soviet economic planning, in response, assert that new research shows that the Soviet figures were partly fabricated, especially those showing extremely high growth in the Stalin era. Growth was impressive in the 1950s and 1960s, in some estimates much higher than during the 1930s, but later declined and according to some estimates became negative in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steele, Charles N|title=The Soviet Experiment: Lessons for Development|year=2002|version=in Morris, J.(ed.), Sustainable Development.

From 1928 to 1985, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew by a factor of 10 and [[Gross National Product|GNP]] [[per capita]] grew more than fivefold. The Soviet economy started out at roughly 25 percent the size of the [[economy of the United States]]. By 1955, it climbed to 40 percent. In 1965, the Soviet economy reached 50% of the contemporary United States economy and in 1977 it passed the 60 percent threshold. For the first half of the Cold War, most economists were asking when, not if, the Soviet economy would overtake the United States economy. Starting in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, growth rates slowed down in the Soviet Union and throughout the socialist bloc.<ref name=\"Ofer, Gur 1988\">Ofer, Gur.

Introduction.</ref> The reasons for this downturn are still a matter of debate among economists, but one hypothesis is that the socialist planned economies had reached the limits of the [[extensive growth]] model they were pursuing and the downturn was at least in part caused by their refusal or inability to switch to [[intensive growth]]. Further, it could be argued that since the economies of countries such as Russia were pre-industrial before the socialist revolutions, the high economic growth rate could be attributed to [[industrialization]]. Also while forms of economic growth associated with any economic structure produce some winners and losers, anticommunists point out that high growth rates under communist rule were associated with particularly intense suffering and even mass starvation of the peasant population.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" ALIGN=\"right\"\n|+ '''Estimates of national income (GNP) growth per year in the Soviet Union, 1928\u20131985'''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Brainerd |title=Reassessing the Standard of Living in the Soviet Union |journal=William Davidson Institute Working Paper |year=2006 |volume=812 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40198/wp812.pdf?sequence=3 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6elSS1ZJn?url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40198/wp812.pdf?sequence=3 |archivedate=January 24, 2016 }}</ref>\n| || [[Grigorii Khanin|Khanin]] || [[Abram Bergson|Bergson]]/[[CIA]] || TsSu\n|-\n|1928\u20131980 || 3.3 || 4.3 || 8.8\n|-\n|1928\u20131941 || 2.9 || 5.8 || 13.9\n|-\n|1950s || 6.9 || 6.0 || 10.1\n|-\n|1960s || 4.2 || 5.2 || 7.1\n|-\n|1970s || 2.0 || 3.7 || 5.3\n|-\n|1980\u20131985 || 0.6 || 2.0 || 3.2\n|-\n|}\nUnlike the slow market reforms in China and Vietnam where communist rule continues, the abrupt end to central planning was followed by a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] in many of the states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which chose to adopt the so-called [[Shock therapy (economics)|economic shock therapy]].

Some reject all comparisons altogether, noting that the communist states started out with economies that were generally much less developed to begin with.<ref name=\"Ofer, Gur 1988\"/>\n\n=== Social development ===\nStarting with the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Soviet leaders pursued a strategy of economic development concentrating the country's economic resources on [[heavy industry]] and [[defense (military)|defense]] rather than on [[consumer goods in the USSR|consumer goods]]. This strategy was later adopted in varying degrees by communist leaders in Eastern Europe and the Third World. For many Western critics of communist strategies of economic development, the unavailability of consumer goods common in the West in the Soviet Union was a case in point of how communist rule resulted in lower [[standard of living|standards of living]].\n\nThe allegation that communist rule resulted in lower standards of living sharply contrasted with communist arguments boasting of the achievements of the social and cultural programs of the Soviet Union and other communist states. For instance, Soviet leaders boasted of guaranteed employment, subsidized food and clothing, free health care, free child care and free education. Soviet leaders also touted early advances in women's equality, particularly in [[Islamic]] areas of Soviet Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Massell, Gregory J. |title=The Surrogate Proletariat: Moslem Women and Revolutionary Strategies in Soviet Central Asia, 1919\u20131929 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1974 |isbn=978-0691075624}}</ref> Eastern European communists often touted high levels of literacy in comparison with many parts of the developing world. A phenomenon called [[Ostalgie]], nostalgia for life under Soviet rule, has been noted amongst former members of Communist countries, now living in Western capitalist states, particularly those who lived in the former East Germany.\n\nThe effects of communist rule on living standards have been harshly criticized.

Horowitz claimed that in the 1980s rationing of meat and sugar was common in the Soviet Union. Horowitz cited studies suggesting the average intake of [[red meat]] for a Soviet citizen was half of what it had been for a subject of the tsar in 1913, that blacks under [[apartheid]] in South Africa owned more cars per capita and that the average welfare mother in the United States received more income in a month than the average Soviet worker could earn in a year. According to Horowitz, the only area of consumption in which the Soviets excelled was the ingestion of [[hard liquor]]. Horowitz also noted that two-thirds of the households had no hot water and a third had no running water at all. Horowitz cited the government newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'', noting a typical working-class family of four was forced to live for eight years in a single eight by eight foot room before marginally better accommodation became available. In his discussion of the Soviet housing shortage, Horowitz stated that the shortage was so acute that at all times 17 percent of Soviet families had to be physically separated for want of adequate space. A third of the hospitals had no running water and the bribery of doctors and nurses to get decent medical attention and even amenities like blankets in Soviet hospitals was not only common, but routine. In his discussion of Soviet education, Horowitz stated that only 15 percent of Soviet youth were able to attend institutions of higher learning compared to 34 percent in the United States.<ref name=\"Horowitz, David 2000\"/> However, large segments of citizens of many former communist today states say that the standard of living has fallen since the end of the Cold War,<ref name=\"Czech News Agency\">{{cite news|title=Poll: Many Czechs say they had better life under Communism|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2011/11/21/poll-many-czechs-say-they-had-better-life-under-communism|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Prague Daily Monitor|date=21 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421190107/http://praguemonitor.com/2011/11/21/poll-many-czechs-say-they-had-better-life-under-communism|archive-date=21 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Pew Research Center\">{{cite web|last=Wikes|first=Richard|title=Hungary Dissatisfied with Democracy, but Not its Ideals|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1554/hungary-economic-discontent-democracy-communism|accessdate=13 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083458/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1554/hungary-economic-discontent-democracy-communism|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> with majorities of citizens in the former East Germany and Romania were polled as saying that life was better under Communism.<ref name=\"Balkan Analysis\">{{cite web|last=Dragomir|first=Elena|title=In Romania, Opinion polls show nostalgia for Communism|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Spiegel Online International\">{{cite news|last=Bonstein|first=Julia|title=Majority of Eastern Germans Feel Life Better under Communism|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,634122,00.html|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=August 3, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of living standards, economist [[Michael Ellman]] asserts that in international comparisons state socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy.<ref>[[Michael Ellman]] (2014).

In the case of the Soviet Union, these criticisms often deal with the preferential treatment afforded to [[socialist realism]]. Other criticisms center on the large-scale cultural experiments of certain communist regimes. In Romania, the historical center of Bucharest was demolished and the whole city was redesigned between 1977 and 1989. In the Soviet Union, hundreds of churches were demolished or converted to secular purposes during the 1920s and 1930s. In China, the [[Cultural Revolution]] sought to give all artistic expression a 'proletarian' content and destroyed much older material lacking this.<ref>Introduction, The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674076087}}.</ref> Advocates of these policies promised to create a new culture that would be superior to the old while critics argue that such policies represented an unjustifiable destruction of the cultural heritage of humanity.\n\nThere is a well-known literature focusing on the role of the falsification of images in the Soviet Union under Stalin. In ''The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs in Stalin's Russia'', [[David King (graphic designer)|David King]] writes: \"So much falsification took place during the Stalin years that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/king-commissar.html The Commissar Vanishes] ''New York Times'', 1997</ref> Under Stalin, historical documents were often the subject of revisionism and forgery, intended to change public perception of certain important people and events. For example, the pivotal role played by [[Leon Trotsky]] in the Russian Revolution and Civil War was almost entirely erased from official historical records after Trotsky became the leader of a Communist faction that opposed Stalin's rule.\n\nThe emphasis on the \"[[hard sciences]]\" of the Soviet Union has been criticized.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former).

[[Lysenkoism]] and [[Japhetic theory (linguistics)|Japhetic theory]] were promoted for brief periods of time in [[biology]] and [[linguistics]] respectively, despite having no scientific merit. Research into [[genetics]] was restricted because [[Nazism|Nazi]] use of [[eugenics]] had prompted the Soviet Union to label genetics a \"fascist science\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalinist Science|last=Krementsov|first=Nikolai|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=60}}</ref> Research was also suppressed in [[cybernetics]], [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] and even [[organic chemistry]] (see [[suppressed research in the Soviet Union]])\n\nSoviet technology in many sectors lagged Western technology. Exceptions include areas like the [[Soviet space program]] and military technology where occasionally Communist technology was more advanced due to a massive concentration of research resources. According to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], much of the technology in the Communist states consisted simply of copies of Western products that had been legally purchased or gained through a massive espionage program. Some even say that stricter Western control of the export of technology through the [[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]] and providing defective technology to Communist agents after the discovery of the [[Farewell Dossier]] contributed to the fall of Communism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis, Christopher |title=The Defence Sector in the Economy of a Declining Superpower: Soviet Union and Russia, 1965\u20132000 |publisher=University of Oxford |year=2000 |version=Forthcoming Article in the Journal Defence and Peace Economics Draft (8/6/00) |url=http://www.econ.ox.ac.uk/Research/WP/PDF/paper008.pdf |access-date=2006-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526094538/http://www.econ.ox.ac.uk/Research/WP/PDF/paper008.pdf |archive-date=2006-05-26 |url-status=dead }}\n{{cite web |title=A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former).

One example is the gradual disappearance of the [[Aral Sea]] and a similar diminishing of the [[Caspian Sea]] because of the diversion of the rivers that fed them. Another is the pollution of the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the unique freshwater environment of [[Lake Baikal]]. Many of the rivers were polluted and several, like the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder]] rivers in Poland, were virtually ecologically dead. Over 70 percent of the surface water in the Soviet Union was polluted. In 1988, only 30 percent of the sewage in the Soviet Union was treated properly. Established health standards for [[air pollution]] was exceeded by ten times or more in 103 cities in the Soviet Union in 1988. The air pollution problem was even more severe in Eastern Europe. It caused a rapid growth in [[lung cancer]], forest die-back and damage to buildings and cultural heritages. According to official sources, 58 percent of total agricultural land of the former Soviet Union was affected by [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[erosion]], [[acidity]], or [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]]. Nuclear waste was dumped in the [[Sea of Japan]], the Arctic Ocean and in locations in the Far East.

Many communists disagree with many of the actions undertaken by ruling Communist parties during the 20th century.\n\nElements of the left opposed to Bolshevik plans before they were put into practice included the revisionist Marxists, such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], who denied the necessity of a revolution. [[anarchism|Anarchists]] (who had differed from Marx and his followers since the split in the [[First International]]), many of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the Marxist [[Mensheviks]] supported the overthrow of the [[tsar]], but vigorously opposed the seizure of power by Lenin and the [[Bolshevik]]s.\n\nCriticisms of Communist rule from the left continued after the creation of the Soviet state. The anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]] led the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] against the Bolsheviks during the [[Russian Civil War]] and the Socialist Revolutionary [[Fanya Kaplan]] tried to assassinate Lenin. [[Bertrand Russell]] visited Russia in 1920 and regarded the Bolsheviks as intelligent, but clueless and planless. In her books about Soviet Russia after the revolution, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'' and ''[[My Further Disillusionment in Russia]]'', [[Emma Goldman]] condemned the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] as a \"massacre\". Eventually, the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] broke with the Bolsheviks.\n\n=== By anti-revisionists ===\n[[Anti-revisionist]]s (which includes radical [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] factions, [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaists]] and [[Maoism|Maoists]]) criticize the rule of the communist states by claiming that they were [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] states ruled by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].<ref name=\"BillBland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oneparty.co.uk/html/book/ussrmenu.html|title=Restoration of Capitalism in the Soviet Union|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/Mao/CSE58.html|title=A Critique of Soviet Economics|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> Though the periods and countries defined as state capitalist or revisionist varies among different ideologies and parties, all of them accept that the Soviet Union was socialist during Stalin's time. Maoists believe that the People's Republic of China became state capitalist after Mao's death. Hoxhaists believe that the People's Republic of China was always state capitalist and uphold [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Socialist Albania]] as the only socialist state after the Soviet Union under Stalin.<ref>[http://ml-review.ca/aml/China/historymaotable.html Class Struggles in China by Bill Bland]</ref>\n\n=== By left communists ===\n[[Left communist]]s<ref name=\"icc\">{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/node/609|title=4.

Some of the earliest critics of [[Leninism]] were the German-Dutch left communists, including [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]] and [[Paul Mattick]]. Though most left communists see the [[October Revolution]] positively, their analysis concludes that by the time of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] the revolution had degenerated due to various historical factors.<ref name=\"icc\"/> [[Rosa Luxemburg]] was another communist who disagreed with Lenin's organizational methods which eventually led to the creation of the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Amadeo Bordiga]] wrote about his view of the Soviet Union as a capitalist society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1922/democratic-principle.htm|title=The Democratic Principle|author=Amadeo Bordiga|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1941/ussr-capitalist.htm|title=The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a Capitalist Society|author=Raya Dunayevskaya|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> In contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy also focused on the agrarian sector. Being the engineer that he was, Bordiga displayed a kind of theoretical rigidity which was both exasperating and effective in allowing him to see things differently. He wanted to show how capitalist social relations existed in the [[kolkhoz]] and in the [[sovkhoz]], one a cooperative farm and the other the straight wage-labor state farm. He emphasized how much of agrarian production depended on the small privately owned plots (he was writing in 1950) and predicted quite accurately the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914. In Bordiga's conception, Stalin and later Mao, Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara were \"great romantic revolutionaries\" in the 19th century sense, i.e. bourgeois revolutionaries. He felt that the Stalinist regimes that came into existence after 1945 were just extending the bourgeois revolution, i.e. the expropriation of the [[Prussian Junker]] class by the Red Army through their agrarian policies and through the development of the productive forces.\n\n=== By Trotskyists ===\nAfter the split between [[Leon Trotsky]] and Stalin, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] have argued that Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a bureaucratic and repressive one-party state and that all subsequent Communist states ultimately followed a similar path because they copied [[Stalinism]]. There are various terms used by Trotskyists to define such states, such as \"[[degenerated workers' state]]\" and \"[[deformed workers' state]]\", \"[[state capitalist]]\" or \"[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic collectivist]]\". While Trotskyists are Leninists, there are other Marxists who reject Leninism entirely, arguing, for example, that the Leninist principle of [[democratic centralism]] was the source of the Soviet Union's slide away from communism. [[Maoism|Maoists]] view the Soviet Union and most of its satellites as \"state capitalist\" as a result of [[destalinization]] and some of them also view modern China in this light.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anti-capitalism]]\n* [[Anti-communism]]\n* [[Anti-Leninism]]\n* [[Anti-Stalinist left]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''\n* [[Communist state]]\n* [[Criticism of capitalism]]\n* [[Criticism of Marxism]]\n* [[Criticism of socialism]]\n* [[Criticism of the United States]]\n* [[Dictatorship]]\n* [[Democracy]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Left communism]]\n* [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Mass killings under communist regimes]]\n* [[One-party state]]\n* [[Red fascism]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Totalitarianism]]\n* [[Victims of Communism Memorial]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Applebaum, Anne, [[Gulag: A History]], Broadway Books, 2003, hardcover, 720 pages, {{ISBN|0767900561}}\n* Applebaum, Anne (foreword) and [[Paul Hollander|Hollander, Paul]] (2006) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130328020335/http://www.isi.org/books/content/384intro.pdf introduction] and editor) ''From the Gulag to the Killing Fields: Personal Accounts of Political Violence and Repression in Communist States.''

He said of the area,<ref>Scenes and Adventures in the Semi-Alpine Regions of the Ozark of Missouri and Arkansas (1853) pg 120-121</ref>\n <blockquote>White River is one of the most beautiful and enchanting streams, and by far the most transparent, which discharge their waters into the Mississippi ... We here behold the assembled tributaries                flowing in a smooth, broad. deep, and majestic current ...                skirted at a short distance by mountains of the most imposing                grandeur.... [The] extreme limpidity and want of colour ... was                early seized upon by the French traders on first visiting this                stream, in calling it \"La Rivi\u00e8re Blanche\" (White                River).</blockquote>\n\nFuture President, [[Herbert Hoover]], spent the summer of 1892 helping [[Geologist]] [[John C. Branner]] survey the Northern [[Ozarks]]. By the early 1900s, there were many mining companies active in both Baxter, and [[Marion County, Arkansas|Marion]] Counties. Cotter quickly became a central point where minerals could be shipped via [[Steamboat]] to much larger cities in Central Arkansas or Southern [[Missouri]].\n\nOriginally, the river bend was known as either Lake's Ferry or Lake's Landing. At this spot, the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] turns sharply, making a convenient border for a town. The Spring that rises up from the caves beneath Cotter, also added to the appeal to early settlers. Lake's Ferry was known as one of the most beautiful spots on the river and was appreciated by locals and tourists.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.railroadworkersmemorial.com/cotterhistory.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821143359/http://www.railroadworkersmemorial.com/cotterhistory.htm |archive-date=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===The railroad===\nSeeking to capitalize on the growing trade in the area, the [[Missouri-Pacific Railroad]] announced plans to open the White River Line which would run through the area and would connect with the main line in Lake's Landing. By 1902, the Cotter post office had opened. Two years later, the first school in Cotter opened. In 1905, the Missouri Pacific Railroad bought the area and sold over one thousand lots, mostly to railroad employees.<ref>Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. \"Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M.

The town was named after William Cotter, an official for the Missouri Pacific Railway System, which built a line through the small town. The materials required to build the town and railroad had to be brought in by steamboats down the White River. Once the railroad was completed, the use of steamboats on the rivers of Arkansas decreased and eventually ceased altogether. In 1906, the first passenger train arrived, and the tourist era began.\n\n===The Bridge===\n\nThe mercurial [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] caused many motorists problems, as the nearest crossing was over {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north in [[Branson, Missouri]]. An inconvenient ferry system made the need for a bridge apparent. Locals wanted a bridge, but they strongly opposed a toll bridge.<ref>Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. \"Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M. Ruthven Bridge).\" 1988.

He said of the area,<ref>Scenes and Adventures in the Semi-Alpine Regions of the Ozark of Missouri and Arkansas (1853) pg 120-121</ref>\n <blockquote>White River is one of the most beautiful and enchanting streams, and by far the most transparent, which discharge their waters into the Mississippi ... We here behold the assembled tributaries                flowing in a smooth, broad. deep, and majestic current ...                skirted at a short distance by mountains of the most imposing                grandeur.... [The] extreme limpidity and want of colour ... was                early seized upon by the French traders on first visiting this                stream, in calling it \"La Rivi\u00e8re Blanche\" (White                River).</blockquote>\n\nFuture President, [[Herbert Hoover]], spent the summer of 1892 helping [[Geologist]] [[John C. Branner]] survey the Northern [[Ozarks]]. By the early 1900s, there were many mining companies active in both Baxter, and [[Marion County, Arkansas|Marion]] Counties. Cotter quickly became a central point where minerals could be shipped via [[Steamboat]] to much larger cities in Central Arkansas or Southern [[Missouri]].\n\nOriginally, the river bend was known as either Lake's Ferry or Lake's Landing. At this spot, the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] turns sharply, making a convenient border for a town. The Spring that rises up from the caves beneath Cotter, also added to the appeal to early settlers. Lake's Ferry was known as one of the most beautiful spots on the river and was appreciated by locals and tourists.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.railroadworkersmemorial.com/cotterhistory.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821143359/http://www.railroadworkersmemorial.com/cotterhistory.htm |archive-date=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===The railroad===\nSeeking to capitalize on the growing trade in the area, the [[Missouri-Pacific Railroad]] announced plans to open the White River Line which would run through the area and would connect with the main line in Lake's Landing. By 1902, the Cotter post office had opened. Two years later, the first school in Cotter opened. In 1905, the Missouri Pacific Railroad bought the area and sold over one thousand lots, mostly to railroad employees.<ref>Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. \"Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M.

The town was named after William Cotter, an official for the Missouri Pacific Railway System, which built a line through the small town. The materials required to build the town and railroad had to be brought in by steamboats down the White River. Once the railroad was completed, the use of steamboats on the rivers of Arkansas decreased and eventually ceased altogether. In 1906, the first passenger train arrived, and the tourist era began.\n\n===The Bridge===\n\nThe mercurial [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] caused many motorists problems, as the nearest crossing was over {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north in [[Branson, Missouri]]. An inconvenient ferry system made the need for a bridge apparent. Locals wanted a bridge, but they strongly opposed a toll bridge.<ref>Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. \"Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M. Ruthven Bridge).\" 1988.

The [[Bengal Sultanate]] was a powerful kingdom between the 14th and 15th centuries. Bengal became an integral part of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the 16th century. The [[Mughal Army]] built [[fortifications]] across the region and expelled Arakanese and Portuguese [[pirate]]s from the northeastern coastline of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Throughout the [[late medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods, Bengal was notable for its [[navy]] and [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]]. Its shipyards produced ships for the Mughal, Ottoman and British navies.\n\nA [[Bengal Army]] was established by the [[British East India Company]] in 1756, including native and European infantry. The native infantry included [[Bengalis]], [[Punjabis]] and [[Gurkhas]]. The Bengal Army was merged into the [[British Indian Army]] after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The British Indian Army participated in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Bengali veterans of the [[Burma Campaign]] served in the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] after the [[partition of India]]. Amid the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and a [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|genocide]] by West Pakistan in 1971, the [[Military of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi military]] was formed by defecting regiments in [[East Pakistan]], led by the [[East Bengal Regiment]]. The guerrilla [[Mukti Bahini]] played an important role during the war of independence. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the Bangladeshi military saw several [[Military coups in Bangladesh|insurrections]] as the country endured [[dictatorship]]. Since the restoration of [[parliamentary democracy]] in 1991, the Bangladesh Armed Forces have been subordinate to the civilian governments, including political and technocratic governments.\n\nSince contributing forces to the [[First Gulf War]] in 1991, Bangladesh has become a major contributor in [[UN Peacekeeping]]. Bangladeshi peacekeepers have served in the [[Balkans]], [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Its recent domestic military history has focused on [[counter-insurgency]], [[counter-terrorism]] and [[maritime security]] operations. \n\nThe [[2008 Bangladesh\u2013Myanmar naval standoff]] was a notable event of modern Bangladeshi military history.\n\n==Early history==\n===Pre-Islamic Era===\nThe early [[military history of India|military history of the Indian subcontinent]] included [[Alexander's invasion of India]], which was deterred by the might of Gangaridai Kingdom that was located in present-day Bangladesh, according to most historians. [[Prince Vijaya]] of the [[Vanga Kingdom]] led a naval expedition to conquer Sri Lanka. The [[Kalinga War]] was a notable event of the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the eastern Indian subcontinent. The ancient Indian armies included [[chariot]]s. \n\n===Pala period===\nThe Bengal region crystallized as an imperial power during the 8th-11th century [[Pala Empire]]. Many of the empire's cities are located in Bangladesh. The Pala military had a large [[war elephant]] cavalry, according to [[Arab people|Arab]] historians. The Palas recruited mercenaries from different parts of the Indian subcontinent. Pala conquests extended across North India. The Palas were engaged in a struggle over the [[Kannauj]] Triangle with the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s and [[Rashtrakuta]]s.\n  \n===Sultanate period===\nThe [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] heralded new military doctrines and hardware, including well-developed [[artillery]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] conquered Bengal in 1204 under the leadership of Bakhtiar Khilji, who later proceeded with an [[Islamic invasion of Tibet]]. In Bengal, the Delhi Sultanate displaced the [[Sena dynasty]]. Sultan Iwas Khilji (1212-1227) was responsible for founding the Bengal [[navy]] during the sultanate period.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> The chief of the [[admiralty]] had various responsibilities, including shipbuilding, transporting personnel, elephants and equipment; recruitment and collecting tolls at [[ghat]]s.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> The sultanate period saw the settlement of many military officers and soldiers from North India, Central and West Asia and the Horn of Africa.

Sher Shah Suri also renovated the [[Grand Trunk Road]] around [[Sonargaon]]. His successors later revived the Bengal Sultanate. \n\n====Isa Khan's campaigns====\nAfter the Bengal Sultanate collapsed in the late 16th-century, the aristocrat [[Isa Khan]] led a confederation of [[zamindar]]s (known as [[Baro-Bhuyan]]) to challenge the [[Mughal invasion of Bengal]], often with [[naval]] battles on the [[Padma River]], [[Meghna River]] and [[Jangalbari Fort]] in [[Egarasindhur]]. Isa Khan defeated Mughal governors [[Khan Jahan I]] in 1578, [[Shahbaz Khan Kamboh|Shahbaz Khan]] in 1584 and [[Man Singh I]] in 1594. His son and successor [[Musa Khan]] continued to lead the confederation until succumbing to the Mughals led by [[Islam Khan I]] in 1610.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Isa_Khan |title=Isa Khan - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=5 May 2014 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Mughal period===\n[[File:Ottoman fleet Indian Ocean 16th century.jpg|thumb|upright|During the 17th century, Ottoman navy vessels were built in Bangladesh]]\nBengal remained relatively stable and prosperous during the 17th century. A key challenge during the early Mughal period was [[piracy]] from the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] and the [[Portuguese settlement in Chittagong]]. In 1666, the Mughal Empire-Kingdom of Mrauk U War expelled the Arakanese and Portuguese from [[Chittagong]]. The Mughals also engaged in the [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]]. During the 18th century, Bengal endured the [[Maratha invasions of Bengal|invasions]] by the [[Maratha Army]]- the military of the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. It fell to the conquest of the [[British East India Company]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]].\n\n===Forts===\nMud forts were common in Bengal, such as the Ekdala Fort used in the [[Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War]]. By the 17th century, the Mughals constructed a series of riverside fortifications in the Bengal delta. Some of the surviving forts include the following.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Fort |title=Fort - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref> \n*[[Mahasthangarh]]\n*[[Idrakpur Fort]]\n*[[Sonakanda Fort]]\n*[[Hajiganj Fort]]\n*[[Lalbagh Fort]]\n*[[Jangalbari Fort]]\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:Lalbag Fort Museum Rezowan3.jpg|thumb|Guns preserved in the [[Lalbagh Fort]] Museum]]\nThe artillery was a vital part of the Bengal military. The Mughal emperor [[Babur]] saw it as a very effective part of the Bengal army. Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] opined that the military supremacy of the Bengal army over that of Arakan and Tripura was due to the efficiency of its artillery. The artillery used [[cannon]]s and [[gun]]s of various sizes.<ref>[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military Military - Banglapedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Bibi Mariam Cannon]] and the [[Jahan Kosha Cannon]] are examples of early modern Bengali artillery. \n\nBengal was a major exporter of [[gunpowder]] and [[saltpeter]] to Europe until the 19th century.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Mercenaries===\nForeign mercenaries were an important part of the Bengal Sultanate army.

The first native infantry was formed in 1757.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> In the 19th century, the Bengal Army was merged into the [[British Indian Army]] under the [[British Raj]]. The [[Royal Indian Navy]] was formed in 1830. The Royal Indian Air Force was formed in 1932. The [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] were raised from the armed forces of the British Raj, which included the [[Bengal Regiment]] and major installations such as the [[Dhaka Cantonment]], [[Chittagong Cantonment]] and the [[Majhira Cantonment|Bogra Cantonment]].The following includes a list of conflicts which occurred within the territory of Bangladesh under British rule.  \n*[[Siege of Calcutta]],

The Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in United Nations Peace Support Operations (UNPSO). During the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Bangladesh Army sent a 2,193 member team to monitor peace in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].

The [[Bengal Sultanate]] was a powerful kingdom between the 14th and 15th centuries. Bengal became an integral part of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the 16th century. The [[Mughal Army]] built [[fortifications]] across the region and expelled Arakanese and Portuguese [[pirate]]s from the northeastern coastline of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Throughout the [[late medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods, Bengal was notable for its [[navy]] and [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]]. Its shipyards produced ships for the Mughal, Ottoman and British navies.\n\nA [[Bengal Army]] was established by the [[British East India Company]] in 1756, including native and [[Europeans|European]] infantry. The native infantry included [[Bengalis]], [[Punjabis]] and [[Gurkhas]]. The Bengal Army was merged into the [[British Indian Army]] after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The British Indian Army participated in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Bengali veterans of the [[Burma Campaign]] served in the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] after the [[partition of India]]. Amid the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and a [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|genocide]] by West Pakistan in 1971, the [[Military of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi military]] was formed by defecting regiments in [[East Pakistan]], led by the [[East Bengal Regiment]]. The guerrilla [[Mukti Bahini]] played an important role during the war of independence. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the Bangladeshi military saw several [[Military coups in Bangladesh|insurrections]] as the country endured [[dictatorship]]. Since the restoration of [[parliamentary democracy]] in 1991, the Bangladesh Armed Forces have been subordinate to the civilian governments, including political and technocratic governments.\n\nSince contributing forces to the [[First Gulf War]] in 1991, Bangladesh has become a major contributor in [[UN Peacekeeping]]. Bangladeshi peacekeepers have served in the [[Balkans]], [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Its recent domestic military history has focused on [[counter-insurgency]], [[counter-terrorism]] and [[maritime security]] operations. \n\nThe [[2008 Bangladesh\u2013Myanmar naval standoff]] was a notable event of modern Bangladeshi military history.\n\n==Early history==\n===Pre-Islamic Era===\nThe early [[military history of India|military history of the Indian subcontinent]] included [[Alexander's invasion of India]], which was deterred by the might of Gangaridai Kingdom that was located in present-day Bangladesh, according to most historians. [[Prince Vijaya]] of the [[Vanga Kingdom]] led a naval expedition to conquer Sri Lanka. The [[Kalinga War]] was a notable event of the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the eastern Indian subcontinent. The ancient Indian armies included [[chariot]]s. \n\n===Pala period===\nThe Bengal region crystallized as an imperial power during the 8th-11th century [[Pala Empire]]. Many of the empire's cities are located in Bangladesh. The Pala military had a large [[war elephant]] cavalry, according to [[Arab people|Arab]] historians. The Palas recruited mercenaries from different parts of the Indian subcontinent. Pala conquests extended across North India. The Palas were engaged in a struggle over the [[Kannauj]] Triangle with the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s and [[Rashtrakuta]]s.\n  \n===Sultanate period===\nThe [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] heralded new military doctrines and hardware, including well-developed [[artillery]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] conquered Bengal in 1204 under the leadership of Bakhtiar Khilji, who later proceeded with an [[Islamic invasion of Tibet]]. In Bengal, the Delhi Sultanate displaced the [[Sena dynasty]]. Sultan Iwas Khilji (1212-1227) was responsible for founding the Bengal [[navy]] during the sultanate period.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> The chief of the [[admiralty]] had various responsibilities, including shipbuilding, transporting personnel, elephants and equipment; recruitment and collecting tolls at [[ghat]]s.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> The sultanate period saw the settlement of many military officers and soldiers from North India, Central and West Asia and the Horn of Africa. The settlers included [[Rajputs]] and [[Pashtuns]]. \n\nIn the 14th century, Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] and [[Hazrat Shah Jalal]] conquered [[Sylhet]] from Raja Gour Govinda;<ref>Muhammad Mojlum Khan (21 October 2013).

Sher Shah Suri also renovated the [[Grand Trunk Road]] around [[Sonargaon]]. His successors later revived the Bengal Sultanate. \n\n====Isa Khan's campaigns====\nAfter the Bengal Sultanate collapsed in the late 16th-century, the aristocrat [[Isa Khan]] led a confederation of [[zamindar]]s (known as [[Baro-Bhuyan]]) to challenge the [[Mughal invasion of Bengal]], often with [[naval]] battles on the [[Padma River]], [[Meghna River]] and [[Jangalbari Fort]] in [[Egarasindhur]]. Isa Khan defeated Mughal governors [[Khan Jahan I]] in 1578, [[Shahbaz Khan Kamboh|Shahbaz Khan]] in 1584 and [[Man Singh I]] in 1594. His son and successor [[Musa Khan]] continued to lead the confederation until succumbing to the Mughals led by [[Islam Khan I]] in 1610.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Isa_Khan |title=Isa Khan - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=5 May 2014 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Mughal period===\n[[File:Ottoman fleet Indian Ocean 16th century.jpg|thumb|upright|During the 17th century, Ottoman navy vessels were built in Bangladesh]]\nBengal remained relatively stable and prosperous during the 17th century. A key challenge during the early Mughal period was [[piracy]] from the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] and the [[Portuguese settlement in Chittagong]]. In 1666, the Mughal Empire-Kingdom of Mrauk U War expelled the Arakanese and Portuguese from [[Chittagong]]. The Mughals also engaged in the [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]]. During the 18th century, Bengal endured the [[Maratha invasions of Bengal|invasions]] by the [[Maratha Army]]- the military of the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. It fell to the conquest of the [[British East India Company]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]].\n\n===Forts===\nMud forts were common in Bengal, such as the Ekdala Fort used in the [[Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War]]. By the 17th century, the Mughals constructed a series of riverside fortifications in the Bengal delta. Some of the surviving forts include the following.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Fort |title=Fort - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref> \n*[[Mahasthangarh]]\n*[[Idrakpur Fort]]\n*[[Sonakanda Fort]]\n*[[Hajiganj Fort]]\n*[[Lalbagh Fort]]\n*[[Jangalbari Fort]]\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:Lalbag Fort Museum Rezowan3.jpg|thumb|Guns preserved in the [[Lalbagh Fort]] Museum]]\nThe artillery was a vital part of the Bengal military. The Mughal emperor [[Babur]] saw it as a very effective part of the Bengal army. Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] opined that the military supremacy of the Bengal army over that of Arakan and Tripura was due to the efficiency of its artillery. The artillery used [[cannon]]s and [[gun]]s of various sizes.<ref>[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military Military - Banglapedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Bibi Mariam Cannon]] and the [[Jahan Kosha Cannon]] are examples of early modern Bengali artillery. \n\nBengal was a major exporter of [[gunpowder]] and [[saltpeter]] to Europe until the 19th century.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Mercenaries===\nForeign mercenaries were an important part of the Bengal Sultanate army.

According to the traveler Frederick Caesar, [[Chittagong]] was a leading shipbuilding center in the 15th century. During the 17th century, the shipyards of Chittagong were reported to have built an entire fleet of warships for the [[Ottoman navy]]. During the [[Mughal Empire]], Bengal was the leading producer ships in the subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shipbuilding_Industry |title=Shipbuilding Industry - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=14 December 2014 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref> \n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had many of its ships built in Chittagong, including vessels used in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].\n\n==Colonial military history==\n[[File:Gravestone back view in Chittagong war cemetery.jpg|thumb|[[Commonwealth War Cemetery, Chittagong]]]]\nThe [[Bengal Army]] was formed in 1765 by the [[British East India Company]]. The first native infantry was formed in 1757.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> In the 19th century, the Bengal Army was merged into the [[British Indian Army]] under the [[British Raj]]. The [[Royal Indian Navy]] was formed in 1830. The Royal Indian Air Force was formed in 1932. The [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] were raised from the armed forces of the British Raj, which included the [[Bengal Regiment]] and major installations such as the [[Dhaka Cantonment]], [[Chittagong Cantonment]] and the [[Majhira Cantonment|Bogra Cantonment]].The following includes a list of conflicts which occurred within the territory of Bangladesh under British rule.  \n*[[Siege of Calcutta]],

The Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in United Nations Peace Support Operations (UNPSO). During the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Bangladesh Army sent a 2,193 member team to monitor peace in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].

As of October 2008, Bangladesh remained the second largest contributor with 9,800 troops in the UN Peacekeeping forces.\n\nUntil a peace accord was signed in 1997, the Bangladeshi military engaged in [[counterinsurgency]] operations in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] fighting the [[Shanti Bahini]] separatist group.
