The population was 1,821 at the 2010 census.\n\n==Geography==\nElkland is located at {{coord|41|59|24|N|77|18|40|W|type:city}} (41.989863, -77.311238).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land. It is located along the [[Cowanesque River]].\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2014}}\nThe [[Parkhurst Memorial Presbyterian Church]] was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20120427.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2012-04-27|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/16/12 through 4/20/12|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n===Elkland Borough===\n\nIn 1814 the township of Elkland, was organized. Its territory, taken from [[Delmar Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Delmar Township]], extended along the New York state line from the ninety-third to the one hundred and fourth mile-stone\u2014a distance of {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}}. It extended north and south a distance of {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} and embraced within its boundaries the present borough of Elkland and townships of [[Nelson Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Nelson]], [[Osceola Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Osceola]], all of [[Farmington Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Farmington]], and parts of [[Lawrence Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Lawrence]], [[Deerfield Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Deerfield]], and [[Middlebury Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Middlebury]] townships. In December 1816, a part of the township of Lawrence was taken from it, and in September 1822, another portion of its territory went to Middlebury township. In February 1830, the territory of the township of Farmington was taken from it. Those several reductions confined it to a narrow strip, about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} long, from east to west, by two and three-fourths miles wide, from north to south. By an act of the legislature, approved April 10, 1849, its territory was still further reduced by the creation of the borough of Elkland, to which, from time to time, additions have been made. In January 1857, all that part of the township not embraced in Elkland borough limits, lying west of a line extending through the center of that borough, from north to south, was erected into the township of Osceola, and in December 1857, all lying east of the same line became the township of Nelson, and Elkland township passed out of existence. By the subsequent extension of the Elkland borough limits south of the Cowanesque river, the townships of Osceola and Nelson both suffered material reductions of area. There is still left, however, a narrow strip between the southern boundary of Elkland and the northern boundary Farmington township, the western half of which belongs to Osceola Township, and the eastern half to the township of Nelson. Some years ago a movement was afoot to annex this strip to Elkland borough and thus give it and Osceola and Nelson townships more symmetrical boundaries, but for some reason the annexation was not made.\n\n===Pioneer Settlers===\n\nA man named Baker Pierce, who died in 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old [[Settler|pioneer]] graveyard at Osceola, appears to have been the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of the first decade of the present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the [[Delaware Water Gap]], New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs\u2014descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor\u2014removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.\n\nIt appears that William Courtright acquired title to the land first bought and settled on by Philip Taylor, which, in 1814, he conveyed to Lintsford Coates. The Coates family came early, as early, so it has been stated, as 1806. In 1808, however, Timothy Coates Sr. acquired the title to {{convert|170|acre|km2}} of land, situated between the lands of Cyprian Wright and those of Amasa Culver, and covered by warrant No. 233 within the limits of what is now Nelson borough, and later he and his son, Lintsford, bought land and became residents of Elkland. The exact year is, however, difficult to ascertain. Daniel Holiday was here previous to 1810, in which year his son, Daniel, now a resident of Holidaytown, Middlebury township, was born.\n\nIn March 1811, came a colony from [[Elmira, New York]] and [[Southport, New York]], consisting of Samuel Tubbs Sr., his sons, Samuel, James and Benjamin, and his sons-in-law, John Ryon Jr., David Hammond, and Martin Stevens. The members of this colony became the owners and occupants of all the land from Barney Hill on the east to the Stull farm on the west, including the Davenport Island and farm on the south side of the river. John Ryon Jr. and his brother James settled in the center of Elkland, which became known as Ryonsville. John Ryon Sr., who joined the settlement later, was the first postmaster of the village and resided there until his death in 1832. John Ryon Jr. early became a prominent and leading spirit. He was elected a justice of the peace in 1816, a member of the legislature in 1822 and 1823, and a member of the state senate in 1824. He was the first [[merchant]] of the village and its most prominent citizen. In 1848, he removed to [[Lawrenceville, PA]], where he died July 22, 1859. Samuel Tubbs settled on what is now known as the Dorrance farm and soon became identified with the material growth of the village. David Hammond settled on the old Hammond homestead now owned by Mrs. C. L. Pattison.\n\nThe names given are those of the pioneers who settled within the borough limits, so far as it has been possible to ascertain them. In time the village took the name of Elkland, growing steadily year by year. it is now one of the most prosperous and progressive boroughs in the county.\n\n===Village Growth===\n\nAs early as 1815, Col. Samuel Tubbs and his sons excavated a mill race around the south side of what afterward became known as Davenport Island and erected a saw-mill and a grist-mill. Col. Lemuel Davenport, who came about 1820, or soon after, acquired this property and owned and operated the mills. In 1870, they were purchased by Hon. John W. Ryon, of [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. In 1885, the grist-mill was changed to a roller-mill. In 1890, the machinery, etc., was removed to a site north of the Fall Brook railroad at the head of Parkhurst street, and the present mill was erected. In 1894, a grain elevator with a capacity of 14,000 bushels of grain was built. During the latter part of 1895, the mill was completely remodeled, and the latest improved machinery was added. It is now a 500-barrel mill and is one of the best equipped in the State. John W. Ryon Jr. is in charge. William Martindell is the superintendent and head miller. About 1840, D. B. Schoff erected a water-power saw-mill on the river in the southern part of the village and operated it for a number of years. It was torn down in 1869 by George Dorrance.\n\nThe first store in the village was opened about 1824 or 1825 by John Ryon Jr. and Robert Tubbs. In 1828, Joel Parkhurst, who had previously been in business with his brother in Lawrenceville, came to Elkland, joined with and later bought them out. He became within a few years, not only a leading business man, but the wealthiest citizen of the Cowanesque valley, maintaining at the same time a well-deserved reputation for liberality, enterprise, and public spirit. In 1832, George L. and Samuel Ryon opened a store and continued in business until 1843. About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David. Other changes occurred previous to Mr. Coates's retirement in 1859 or 1860.\n\nAs the country became more settled, the village grew slowly, new stores being started, a school house built, a church organized, and such other trade and industrial enterprises set on foot as the condition and necessities of the people demanded. In the winter of 1839\u201340, James Tubbs, father of Hon. Charles Tubbs, of Osceola, and who is still living, taught a school in the village. Recently in a reminiscent article published in the Elkland Journal, he described this school and the pupils who attended and closed with the following description of the village:\n\n\"At the time of my school Elkland was a mere hamlet, not even a four corners, as there was no street from Skinner's store to the river. On what is now Buffalo street two families lived\u2014Anson Blackman's and Alvinzi Foote's. Stanley, the tailor, had just occupied the house in which Dr. Rockwell now lives. Martin Stevens, carpenter, and Asaph Johnson lived on the farm where the Postal Telegraph Company's office is, and Benjamin Tubbs on the lower part of the Dorrance farm. The leading citizen was John Ryon. He had been representative and senator, and at the time of my school had a seat upon the bench as associate judge. He gave the land where the school house was built; the land for the cemetery, and the site for the Presbyterian church, which had then been built about one year. his son, John W., has become my most distinguished scholar, having been a member of Congress. Elisha B. Benedict was the physician of the place, and Rev. Octavius Fitch, the Presbyterian minister. Joel Parkhurst, who settled in Elkland eleven years previously, kept a store on the site of the Journal office, and was the postmaster. The mail arrived twice a week at the postoffice. There was no bridge across the river.\n\n===Later Years===\n\nThe Elkland [[Tanning (leather)|Tannery]] was established about 1851 by James Hancock on the south bank of the [[Cowanesque River]]. He was soon succeeded by S. G. Tabor & Son. In 1853, Joel Parkhurst acquired the property, which he continued to own until 1873, when he sold it to Joseph Cornelius. He owned and operated it in connection with his sons until 1893, when it passed into the hands of Proctor, Hunt & Co., of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Mr. Cornelius retaining an interest in the business. In January 1893, the tannery was destroyed by fire and rebuilt on the present site north of the Fall Brook railroad, beginning operations November 11, 1893.\n\nDecker & Metcalf's Sash, Door and Blind Factory was established about 1857. They ran it nearly twenty years. The property had various owners afterwards, finally falling into the hands of C. L. Pattison who removed the plant north of the railroads and incorporated it with the furniture factory.\n\nThe Cowanesque Valley Oil Company was incorporated in July 1877, the incorporators being Garrett W. Benson, [[Olean, New York]], and John Parkhurst, Charles L. Pattison, Benjamin Dorrance, and J. C. Edwards, of Elkland. An [[oil well]] was sunk on the Hammond place southwest of the borough. Oil and gas were both found, but in limited quantities.\n\nThe Elkland Furniture Association (Limited) was incorporated March 25, 1882, by Charles L. Pattison, William L. Simmons and Abram Coon, with a capital stock of $6,287.34. Its object was the manufacture and vending of furniture of every description. The plant was installed in ample buildings north of the railroad, and a large business soon built up. In 1890, one hundred hands were employed. The factory was destroyed by fire January 7, 1893. A movement to rebuild was immediately set on foot but was not successful.\n\nThe Elkland Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of toys and novelties, was established in Elkland in January 1887. Charles W. Crandall, the superintendent, was the son of [[Charles Martin Crandall]], known as the maker of Crandall's building blocks and grandson of Asa Crandall who ran a furniture factory in Covington in 1840. Mr. Crandall was in the same business in [[Montrose, Pennsylvania]], where his large factory burned August 27, 1886, involving a loss of $46,000. From sixty to seventy-five men were constantly employed, the annual output amounting to $40,000. Toys and novelties were shipped to all parts of the world.\n\n===Schools===\nThe early schools in Elkland, as in other places throughout the county, were supported by subscription, and until the building of the first school house in 1827, were taught in any house that could be secured for the purpose. The year when the first school was opened has not been ascertained, but it was probably as early as 1814 or 1816. Among the first teachers were Henry Womer, Miss Mary Ryon and Harriet B. Wright. Miss Wright, who afterwards became the wife of Ira Bulkley, taught a term of thirteen weeks beginning June 14, 1824, in an old log dwelling house \"located where C. L. Pattison now resides.\" She had eighteen pupils\u2014eight boys and ten girls. They were John, Amariah and Hannah (wife of George L. Byon) Hammond; Esther Wright (second wife of Ira Bulkley); Elizabeth Cook (wife of Orsemus Rathbone); Willis and Nancy (wife of Brockhurst L. Baker) Hammond; George L. and Harris T. Ryon; Benson, Elizabeth and Charles Tubbs; Maria Coates (wife of Lorenzo Cook); Edward, Charlotte and Hester Buck; Phebe Mascho, who died young, and her brother Charles; and a girl named Rifle, who lived in the family of John Ryon, Sr. Miss Wright's pay for teaching was \"calculated at one dollar per week, or one bushel of good merchantable wheat.\" In 1892 her sister Esther, one of her pupils, who became the second wife of Ira Bulkley, dictated for publication an article which appeared in the Elkland Journal, in which she said:\n\nElkland at that time, did not show signs of becoming a village. It had no [[tavern]], nor store, nor shop of any kind\u2014not even a distillery. There was no church in the Cowanesque valley, and the itinerant [[Methodist]] ministers who passed this way once in six weeks, held preaching services in some barn in the summer season. John Ryon, Sr. was postmaster and kept the office at his dwelling house, at which the mail arrived by carrier on horseback, once a week (Tuesdays). \"John Ryon, Esq.,\" as my father wrote his name among the patrons of my sister's school, was at that time a member of the state senate, deservedly popular, a most generous and obliging gentleman.\n\nIn 1827 the first school building was erected. It is still standing just west of the [[Presbyterian]] church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of [[Mansfield, PA]]. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver's Point\u2014now Lawrenceville\u2014for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839\u201340. in the article already quoted from, he says: \"I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship.\"\n\nThe second school house was built in 1855, and was a two-story frame, with rooms for two departments. In 1876 Joel Parkhurst proposed to give the district a new brick school house, costing $4,000, provided the people would raise a fund of $1,500, to be placed at interest and the interest used to keep the house in order and purchase apparatus. The offer was accepted and the building erected. It ranks as third among the school houses of the county. Prof. M. F. Cass has been principal of this school since 1891, and has proven himself an able, efficient and popular educator.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Map of Tioga County Pennsylvania School Districts.png|250 px|thumb|Map of Tioga County, Pennsylvania School Districts]]\n\nResidents of Elkland may attend the local, public schools operated by [[Northern Tioga School District]] which provides full day kindergarten through 12th grade.

Its territory, taken from [[Delmar Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Delmar Township]], extended along the New York state line from the ninety-third to the one hundred and fourth mile-stone\u2014a distance of {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}}. It extended north and south a distance of {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} and embraced within its boundaries the present borough of Elkland and townships of [[Nelson Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Nelson]], [[Osceola Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Osceola]], all of [[Farmington Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Farmington]], and parts of [[Lawrence Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Lawrence]], [[Deerfield Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Deerfield]], and [[Middlebury Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Middlebury]] townships. In December 1816, a part of the township of Lawrence was taken from it, and in September 1822, another portion of its territory went to Middlebury township. In February 1830, the territory of the township of Farmington was taken from it. Those several reductions confined it to a narrow strip, about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} long, from east to west, by two and three-fourths miles wide, from north to south. By an act of the legislature, approved April 10, 1849, its territory was still further reduced by the creation of the borough of Elkland, to which, from time to time, additions have been made. In January 1857, all that part of the township not embraced in Elkland borough limits, lying west of a line extending through the center of that borough, from north to south, was erected into the township of Osceola, and in December 1857, all lying east of the same line became the township of Nelson, and Elkland township passed out of existence. By the subsequent extension of the Elkland borough limits south of the Cowanesque river, the townships of Osceola and Nelson both suffered material reductions of area. There is still left, however, a narrow strip between the southern boundary of Elkland and the northern boundary Farmington township, the western half of which belongs to Osceola Township, and the eastern half to the township of Nelson. Some years ago a movement was afoot to annex this strip to Elkland borough and thus give it and Osceola and Nelson townships more symmetrical boundaries, but for some reason the annexation was not made.\n\n===Pioneer Settlers===\n\nA man named Baker Pierce, who died in 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old [[Settler|pioneer]] graveyard at Osceola, appears to have been the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of the first decade of the present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the [[Delaware Water Gap]], New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs\u2014descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor\u2014removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.\n\nIt appears that William Courtright acquired title to the land first bought and settled on by Philip Taylor, which, in 1814, he conveyed to Lintsford Coates. The Coates family came early, as early, so it has been stated, as 1806. In 1808, however, Timothy Coates Sr. acquired the title to {{convert|170|acre|km2}} of land, situated between the lands of Cyprian Wright and those of Amasa Culver, and covered by warrant No. 233 within the limits of what is now Nelson borough, and later he and his son, Lintsford, bought land and became residents of Elkland. The exact year is, however, difficult to ascertain. Daniel Holiday was here previous to 1810, in which year his son, Daniel, now a resident of Holidaytown, Middlebury township, was born.\n\nIn March 1811, came a colony from [[Elmira, New York]] and [[Southport, New York]], consisting of Samuel Tubbs Sr., his sons, Samuel, James and Benjamin, and his sons-in-law, John Ryon Jr., David Hammond, and Martin Stevens. The members of this colony became the owners and occupants of all the land from Barney Hill on the east to the Stull farm on the west, including the Davenport Island and farm on the south side of the river. John Ryon Jr. and his brother James settled in the center of Elkland, which became known as Ryonsville. John Ryon Sr., who joined the settlement later, was the first postmaster of the village and resided there until his death in 1832. John Ryon Jr. early became a prominent and leading spirit. He was elected a justice of the peace in 1816, a member of the legislature in 1822 and 1823, and a member of the state senate in 1824. He was the first [[merchant]] of the village and its most prominent citizen. In 1848, he removed to [[Lawrenceville, PA]], where he died July 22, 1859. Samuel Tubbs settled on what is now known as the Dorrance farm and soon became identified with the material growth of the village. David Hammond settled on the old Hammond homestead now owned by Mrs. C. L. Pattison.\n\nThe names given are those of the pioneers who settled within the borough limits, so far as it has been possible to ascertain them. In time the village took the name of Elkland, growing steadily year by year. it is now one of the most prosperous and progressive boroughs in the county.\n\n===Village Growth===\n\nAs early as 1815, Col. Samuel Tubbs and his sons excavated a mill race around the south side of what afterward became known as Davenport Island and erected a saw-mill and a grist-mill. Col. Lemuel Davenport, who came about 1820, or soon after, acquired this property and owned and operated the mills. In 1870, they were purchased by Hon. John W. Ryon, of [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. In 1885, the grist-mill was changed to a roller-mill. In 1890, the machinery, etc., was removed to a site north of the Fall Brook railroad at the head of Parkhurst street, and the present mill was erected. In 1894, a grain elevator with a capacity of 14,000 bushels of grain was built. During the latter part of 1895, the mill was completely remodeled, and the latest improved machinery was added. It is now a 500-barrel mill and is one of the best equipped in the State. John W. Ryon Jr. is in charge. William Martindell is the superintendent and head miller. About 1840, D. B. Schoff erected a water-power saw-mill on the river in the southern part of the village and operated it for a number of years. It was torn down in 1869 by George Dorrance.\n\nThe first store in the village was opened about 1824 or 1825 by John Ryon Jr. and Robert Tubbs. In 1828, Joel Parkhurst, who had previously been in business with his brother in Lawrenceville, came to Elkland, joined with and later bought them out. He became within a few years, not only a leading business man, but the wealthiest citizen of the Cowanesque valley, maintaining at the same time a well-deserved reputation for liberality, enterprise, and public spirit. In 1832, George L. and Samuel Ryon opened a store and continued in business until 1843. About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David. Other changes occurred previous to Mr. Coates's retirement in 1859 or 1860.\n\nAs the country became more settled, the village grew slowly, new stores being started, a school house built, a church organized, and such other trade and industrial enterprises set on foot as the condition and necessities of the people demanded. In the winter of 1839\u201340, James Tubbs, father of Hon. Charles Tubbs, of Osceola, and who is still living, taught a school in the village. Recently in a reminiscent article published in the Elkland Journal, he described this school and the pupils who attended and closed with the following description of the village:\n\n\"At the time of my school Elkland was a mere hamlet, not even a four corners, as there was no street from Skinner's store to the river. On what is now Buffalo street two families lived\u2014Anson Blackman's and Alvinzi Foote's. Stanley, the tailor, had just occupied the house in which Dr. Rockwell now lives. Martin Stevens, carpenter, and Asaph Johnson lived on the farm where the Postal Telegraph Company's office is, and Benjamin Tubbs on the lower part of the Dorrance farm. The leading citizen was John Ryon. He had been representative and senator, and at the time of my school had a seat upon the bench as associate judge. He gave the land where the school house was built; the land for the cemetery, and the site for the Presbyterian church, which had then been built about one year. his son, John W., has become my most distinguished scholar, having been a member of Congress. Elisha B. Benedict was the physician of the place, and Rev. Octavius Fitch, the Presbyterian minister. Joel Parkhurst, who settled in Elkland eleven years previously, kept a store on the site of the Journal office, and was the postmaster. The mail arrived twice a week at the postoffice. There was no bridge across the river.\n\n===Later Years===\n\nThe Elkland [[Tanning (leather)|Tannery]] was established about 1851 by James Hancock on the south bank of the [[Cowanesque River]]. He was soon succeeded by S. G. Tabor & Son. In 1853, Joel Parkhurst acquired the property, which he continued to own until 1873, when he sold it to Joseph Cornelius. He owned and operated it in connection with his sons until 1893, when it passed into the hands of Proctor, Hunt & Co., of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Mr. Cornelius retaining an interest in the business. In January 1893, the tannery was destroyed by fire and rebuilt on the present site north of the Fall Brook railroad, beginning operations November 11, 1893.\n\nDecker & Metcalf's Sash, Door and Blind Factory was established about 1857. They ran it nearly twenty years. The property had various owners afterwards, finally falling into the hands of C. L. Pattison who removed the plant north of the railroads and incorporated it with the furniture factory.\n\nThe Cowanesque Valley Oil Company was incorporated in July 1877, the incorporators being Garrett W. Benson, [[Olean, New York]], and John Parkhurst, Charles L. Pattison, Benjamin Dorrance, and J. C. Edwards, of Elkland. An [[oil well]] was sunk on the Hammond place southwest of the borough. Oil and gas were both found, but in limited quantities.\n\nThe Elkland Furniture Association (Limited) was incorporated March 25, 1882, by Charles L. Pattison, William L. Simmons and Abram Coon, with a capital stock of $6,287.34. Its object was the manufacture and vending of furniture of every description. The plant was installed in ample buildings north of the railroad, and a large business soon built up. In 1890, one hundred hands were employed. The factory was destroyed by fire January 7, 1893. A movement to rebuild was immediately set on foot but was not successful.\n\nThe Elkland Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of toys and novelties, was established in Elkland in January 1887. Charles W. Crandall, the superintendent, was the son of [[Charles Martin Crandall]], known as the maker of Crandall's building blocks and grandson of Asa Crandall who ran a furniture factory in Covington in 1840. Mr. Crandall was in the same business in [[Montrose, Pennsylvania]], where his large factory burned August 27, 1886, involving a loss of $46,000. From sixty to seventy-five men were constantly employed, the annual output amounting to $40,000. Toys and novelties were shipped to all parts of the world.\n\n===Schools===\nThe early schools in Elkland, as in other places throughout the county, were supported by subscription, and until the building of the first school house in 1827, were taught in any house that could be secured for the purpose. The year when the first school was opened has not been ascertained, but it was probably as early as 1814 or 1816. Among the first teachers were Henry Womer, Miss Mary Ryon and Harriet B. Wright. Miss Wright, who afterwards became the wife of Ira Bulkley, taught a term of thirteen weeks beginning June 14, 1824, in an old log dwelling house \"located where C. L. Pattison now resides.\" She had eighteen pupils\u2014eight boys and ten girls. They were John, Amariah and Hannah (wife of George L. Byon) Hammond; Esther Wright (second wife of Ira Bulkley); Elizabeth Cook (wife of Orsemus Rathbone); Willis and Nancy (wife of Brockhurst L. Baker) Hammond; George L. and Harris T. Ryon; Benson, Elizabeth and Charles Tubbs; Maria Coates (wife of Lorenzo Cook); Edward, Charlotte and Hester Buck; Phebe Mascho, who died young, and her brother Charles; and a girl named Rifle, who lived in the family of John Ryon, Sr. Miss Wright's pay for teaching was \"calculated at one dollar per week, or one bushel of good merchantable wheat.\" In 1892 her sister Esther, one of her pupils, who became the second wife of Ira Bulkley, dictated for publication an article which appeared in the Elkland Journal, in which she said:\n\nElkland at that time, did not show signs of becoming a village. It had no [[tavern]], nor store, nor shop of any kind\u2014not even a distillery. There was no church in the Cowanesque valley, and the itinerant [[Methodist]] ministers who passed this way once in six weeks, held preaching services in some barn in the summer season. John Ryon, Sr. was postmaster and kept the office at his dwelling house, at which the mail arrived by carrier on horseback, once a week (Tuesdays). \"John Ryon, Esq.,\" as my father wrote his name among the patrons of my sister's school, was at that time a member of the state senate, deservedly popular, a most generous and obliging gentleman.\n\nIn 1827 the first school building was erected. It is still standing just west of the [[Presbyterian]] church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of [[Mansfield, PA]]. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver's Point\u2014now Lawrenceville\u2014for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839\u201340. in the article already quoted from, he says: \"I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship.\"\n\nThe second school house was built in 1855, and was a two-story frame, with rooms for two departments. In 1876 Joel Parkhurst proposed to give the district a new brick school house, costing $4,000, provided the people would raise a fund of $1,500, to be placed at interest and the interest used to keep the house in order and purchase apparatus. The offer was accepted and the building erected. It ranks as third among the school houses of the county. Prof. M. F. Cass has been principal of this school since 1891, and has proven himself an able, efficient and popular educator.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Map of Tioga County Pennsylvania School Districts.png|250 px|thumb|Map of Tioga County, Pennsylvania School Districts]]\n\nResidents of Elkland may attend the local, public schools operated by [[Northern Tioga School District]] which provides full day kindergarten through 12th grade.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n:: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a nominal subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, noun phrases are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe '''told''' us '''that''' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. ''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The city is located {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the Caribbean sea, by the [[Sin\u00fa River]]. The city and region are known for their distinct cultural heritages, which include a blend of indigenous [[Zen\u00fa|Zen\u00fa Indians]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descendants, colonial [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descendants, and more recently, [[Levantine]] immigrants. The city is home to the [[Sombrero Vueltiao]], a national symbol; and is the home of [[Porro]] folklore music. The city has an inland seaport connected to the Caribbean Sea by the [[Sin\u00fa River]].\n\n==History==\nThe area was first settled by [[Zen\u00fa|Zen\u00fa Indians]], who lived in the banks of the [[Sin\u00fa River]] ([[Finzen\u00fa]]), [[San Jorge River]] ([[Panzen\u00fa]]) and [[Nechi River|Nech\u00ed River]] ([[Zen\u00fafana]]), where the Department of C\u00f3rdoba is located today. In 2003, dentist and historian [[Jaime Castro]] released '''Historia Extensa de Monter\u00eda''', a book on the history of the city.  According to Castro's book, Monter\u00eda was founded on May 1, 1777 by Spanish officer [[Antonio de la Torre y Miranda]], being governor of the Province of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] officer [[Juan de Torrezar D\u00edaz Pimienta]].  The city, which had been named Monter\u00eda by its inhabitants and located on the east side of the Sin\u00fa river, was then renamed \"San Jer\u00f3nimo de Buenavista\" and moved to the west side of the Sin\u00fa.\n\n'''San Jer\u00f3nimo de Buenavista''' was the name chosen by Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, in order to honor Saint Jeronimo, but people referred to it as Monter\u00eda.  In 1803, the city was burned by a group of natives, so the residents decided to move back to the Sin\u00fa's east bank, where it remains today. In recent years, Monteria has seen a growth in population on the west side.  In 1923, it became a municipality of Bol\u00edvar Department, and in 1952, it was designated as capital of the new Department of C\u00f3rdoba. Monter\u00eda was located within the boundaries of the [[Colombia]]n Department of [[Bol\u00edvar Department|Bol\u00edvar]] until 1952 when it separated from Bol\u00edvar and became the capital of the new Department of [[C\u00f3rdoba Department|C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nWith a population of approximately 400,000, the city is considered to be one of the ten most important cities in Colombia and is locally known as '''La Perla del Sin\u00fa''' (The Pearl of the River Sin\u00fa).\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Atardecersinuano.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Valley of the Sinu river]]\nThe city, which lies in the Sin\u00fa valley, is divided by the Sinu river and surrounded and sparsely populated by tropical flora and fauna.

newspaper)\n* ''El Universal'' (regional newspaper)\n\n==Economy==\nThe town's economy is based mainly on cattle farming, and a very prosperous commercial district consisting of modern malls, shops, and restaurant chains.  It is considered to be the Cattle Farming Capital of Colombia and celebrates this title with a yearly festival.\n\nPlus, the city is one of the most important destination with venues of the country by having Great Stadiums and  Convention centers, and have received important celebrities such as [[Maelo Ruiz]], [[Jorge Celed\u00f3n]], [[Shakira]], [[Years & Years|Years and Years]], [[Juanes]], [[Carlos Vives]], among others.\n\n==Transportation==\nMonteria lies on a major highway connecting [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Sincelejo]] and extending to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and [[Barranquilla]].  It has an effective public transportation system and arterial connections to the rest of the country.\n\n===Public transportation===\nAs is common in most Colombian municipalities, public transportation is tightly integrated into the city.  A system of taxis and several lines of large and small buses serve the community on surface streets. The streets of Monteria are also full of motorcycle taxis or \"rapimotos\" that provide economical transportation.\n\nA passenger-only ferry system known as \"Planchones\", consists of roofed wooden rafts. It traverses the Sinu river along a system of manual cable tows. It was made as a way to cross the river before a proper bridge could be built and has served as an alternative to cross the river ever since. It is one of the most remarkable features of the city.{{or-inline|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Monteria1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of '''Monteria''' from the Sinu river.]]\nThe city is served by a fishing port, but the waters of the Sinu river do not run deep enough and are not wide enough to serve as a commercial channel.  High quality sand is brought up from the bottom of the river in buckets placed by divers, for use in the making of cinder blocks for local and regional construction projects.\n\n===Air travel===\nMonteria is home to an international airport, [[Los Garzones Airport]], which provides service to capital cities of neighboring provinces, through the country's main air carrier [[Avianca]], easyfly and LATAM airlines.\n\nThe main cities served from the airport are [[Panama City]] and [[Bogot\u00e1]]\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region is populated by a diverse mix of people, including the indigenous people of the region, the descendants of the Sinu Indians, a tribe of natives with their own language that once produced ornate pottery and goldworks.\n\n==Tourism and sport==\n===Sites of interest===\n[[File:Monteria2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Colonial church in downtown '''Monteria'''.]]\nSites of interest in Monteria include:\n* The city's 1st Avenue<ref>https://archive.is/20070824052359/http://www.cordoba.gov.co/monteria/fotos/avenida/foto_27.html</ref> runs along the Sin\u00fa river.\n* Simon Bolivar Park separates the river from 1st Avenue and is home to wild monkeys and sloths.\n* [[Cove\u00f1as]] Beach is a beach which has a lot of tourist attractions.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n* The Colonial-era Cathedral of Saint Jeronimo is surrounded by a park.\n* [[Alamedas del Sinu]] is a shopping center in the area.\n* The bridge spanning the Sinu river is a local landmark.\n* [[Centro Comercial Buenavista Monter\u00eda]]\n\n===Sporting clubs===\n* Centro Recreacional Tacasu\u00e1n\n* Club Campestre\n* Club de golf\n* [[Jaguares de Cordoba]] - Professional Soccer team that plays in Jaraguay Stadium in Monter\u00eda\n\n==Education==\nBoth public and private educational institutions run the gamut from unlicensed private preschools to fully accredited universities.\n\n===Universities===\n* University of Cordoba [http://www.unicordoba.edu.co/] ([http://www.unicordoba.edu.co/ website]) (Public)\n* [http://www.cordoba.gov.co/monteria/fotos/moderna/foto_60.html Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071019062238/http://www.upbmonteria.edu.co/ website]) (Catholic)\n* [http://www.unisinu.edu.co/ Universidad del Sin\u00fa]\n* [http://www.funlam.edu.co/ Fundaci\u00f3n Universitaria Luis Amig\u00f3]\n* [[Cooperative University of Colombia]]\n* [http://www.cecar.edu.co/ Corporaci\u00f3n Universitaria del Caribe]\n\n== Sister Cities ==\n* [[Venice]], [[Italy]]\n* [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], [[United States]]\n\n==Health care==\nA new hospital was recently{{when|date=April 2019}} constructed in Barrio Urbina, called The Hospital of Saint Jeronimo.

The city is located {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the Caribbean sea, by the [[Sin\u00fa River]]. The city and region are known for their distinct cultural heritages, which include a blend of indigenous [[Zen\u00fa|Zen\u00fa Indians]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descendants, colonial [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descendants, and more recently, [[Arab]] immigrants. The city is home to the [[Sombrero Vueltiao]], a national symbol; and is the home of [[Porro]] folklore music. The city has an inland seaport connected to the Caribbean Sea by the [[Sin\u00fa River]].\n\n==History==\nThe area was first settled by [[Zen\u00fa|Zen\u00fa Indians]], who lived in the banks of the [[Sin\u00fa River]] ([[Finzen\u00fa]]), [[San Jorge River]] ([[Panzen\u00fa]]) and [[Nechi River|Nech\u00ed River]] ([[Zen\u00fafana]]), where the Department of C\u00f3rdoba is located today. In 2003, dentist and historian [[Jaime Castro]] released '''Historia Extensa de Monter\u00eda''', a book on the history of the city.  According to Castro's book, Monter\u00eda was founded on May 1, 1777 by Spanish officer [[Antonio de la Torre y Miranda]], being governor of the Province of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] officer [[Juan de Torrezar D\u00edaz Pimienta]].  The city, which had been named Monter\u00eda by its inhabitants and located on the east side of the Sin\u00fa river, was then renamed \"San Jer\u00f3nimo de Buenavista\" and moved to the west side of the Sin\u00fa.\n\n'''San Jer\u00f3nimo de Buenavista''' was the name chosen by Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, in order to honor Saint Jeronimo, but people referred to it as Monter\u00eda.  In 1803, the city was burned by a group of natives, so the residents decided to move back to the Sin\u00fa's east bank, where it remains today. In recent years, Monteria has seen a growth in population on the west side.  In 1923, it became a municipality of Bol\u00edvar Department, and in 1952, it was designated as capital of the new Department of C\u00f3rdoba. Monter\u00eda was located within the boundaries of the [[Colombia]]n Department of [[Bol\u00edvar Department|Bol\u00edvar]] until 1952 when it separated from Bol\u00edvar and became the capital of the new Department of [[C\u00f3rdoba Department|C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nWith a population of approximately 400,000, the city is considered to be one of the ten most important cities in Colombia and is locally known as '''La Perla del Sin\u00fa''' (The Pearl of the River Sin\u00fa).\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Atardecersinuano.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Valley of the Sinu river]]\nThe city, which lies in the Sin\u00fa valley, is divided by the Sinu river and surrounded and sparsely populated by tropical flora and fauna.  The town's weather is mainly warm and moderately humid, with average yearly temperatures of 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (80&nbsp;\u00b0F).  The area is subject to flooding.\n\n<div style=\"width:82%;\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Monter\u00eda ([[Los Garzones Airport]]) 1981\u20132010\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = y\n|collapsed = y

newspaper)\n* ''El Universal'' (regional newspaper)\n\n==Economy==\nThe town's economy is based mainly on cattle farming, and a very prosperous commercial district consisting of modern malls, shops, and restaurant chains.  It is considered to be the Cattle Farming Capital of Colombia and celebrates this title with a yearly festival.\n\nPlus, the city is one of the most important destination with venues of the country by having Great Stadiums and  Convention centers, and have received important celebrities such as [[Maelo Ruiz]], [[Jorge Celed\u00f3n]], [[Shakira]], [[Years & Years|Years and Years]], [[Juanes]], [[Carlos Vives]], among others.\n\n==Transportation==\nMonteria lies on a major highway connecting [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Sincelejo]] and extending to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and [[Barranquilla]].  It has an effective public transportation system and arterial connections to the rest of the country.\n\n===Public transportation===\nAs is common in most Colombian municipalities, public transportation is tightly integrated into the city.  A system of taxis and several lines of large and small buses serve the community on surface streets. The streets of Monteria are also full of motorcycle taxis or \"rapimotos\" that provide economical transportation.\n\nA passenger-only ferry system known as \"Planchones\", consists of roofed wooden rafts. It traverses the Sinu river along a system of manual cable tows. It was made as a way to cross the river before a proper bridge could be built and has served as an alternative to cross the river ever since. It is one of the most remarkable features of the city.{{or-inline|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Monteria1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of '''Monteria''' from the Sinu river.]]\nThe city is served by a fishing port, but the waters of the Sinu river do not run deep enough and are not wide enough to serve as a commercial channel.  High quality sand is brought up from the bottom of the river in buckets placed by divers, for use in the making of cinder blocks for local and regional construction projects.\n\n===Air travel===\nMonteria is home to an international airport, [[Los Garzones Airport]], which provides service to capital cities of neighboring provinces, through the country's main air carrier [[Avianca]], easyfly and LATAM airlines.\n\nThe main cities served from the airport are [[Panama City]] and [[Bogot\u00e1]]\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region is populated by a diverse mix of people, including the indigenous people of the region, the descendants of the Sinu Indians, a tribe of natives with their own language that once produced ornate pottery and goldworks.\n\n==Tourism and sport==\n===Sites of interest===\n[[File:Monteria2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Colonial church in downtown '''Monteria'''.]]\nSites of interest in Monteria include:\n* The city's 1st Avenue<ref>https://archive.is/20070824052359/http://www.cordoba.gov.co/monteria/fotos/avenida/foto_27.html</ref> runs along the Sin\u00fa river.\n* Simon Bolivar Park separates the river from 1st Avenue and is home to wild monkeys and sloths.\n* [[Cove\u00f1as]] Beach is a beach which has a lot of tourist attractions.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n* The Colonial-era Cathedral of Saint Jeronimo is surrounded by a park.\n* [[Alamedas del Sinu]] is a shopping center in the area.\n* The bridge spanning the Sinu river is a local landmark.\n* [[Centro Comercial Buenavista Monter\u00eda]]\n\n===Sporting clubs===\n* Centro Recreacional Tacasu\u00e1n\n* Club Campestre\n* Club de golf\n* [[Jaguares de Cordoba]] - Professional Soccer team that plays in Jaraguay Stadium in Monter\u00eda\n\n==Education==\nBoth public and private educational institutions run the gamut from unlicensed private preschools to fully accredited universities.\n\n===Universities===\n* University of Cordoba [http://www.unicordoba.edu.co/] ([http://www.unicordoba.edu.co/ website]) (Public)\n* [http://www.cordoba.gov.co/monteria/fotos/moderna/foto_60.html Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071019062238/http://www.upbmonteria.edu.co/ website]) (Catholic)\n* [http://www.unisinu.edu.co/ Universidad del Sin\u00fa]\n* [http://www.funlam.edu.co/ Fundaci\u00f3n Universitaria Luis Amig\u00f3]\n* [[Cooperative University of Colombia]]\n* [http://www.cecar.edu.co/ Corporaci\u00f3n Universitaria del Caribe]\n\n== Sister Cities ==\n* [[Venice]], [[Italy]]\n* [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], [[United States]]\n\n==Health care==\nA new hospital was recently{{when|date=April 2019}} constructed in Barrio Urbina, called The Hospital of Saint Jeronimo.

The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\nPittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.\n\nAs the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.\n\n=== Slavery and racial segregation ===\nThe area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />\n\nIn 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>\n\n=== Early industrialization ===\nDuring the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.\n\n=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===\n[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]\nOn March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.\n\nThe building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.\n\n[[File:2013-08-18--14.46.12-tpl.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the west-northwest, the Chatham County Court House in August 2013, having been rebuilt after a fire destroyed the upper floors and clock tower.]]\nThe fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>\n\n== City government ==\nThe mayor of Pittsboro is elected [[at-large]].

The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\nPittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.\n\nAs the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.\n\n=== Slavery and racial segregation ===\nThe area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />\n\nIn 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>\n\n=== Early industrialization ===\nDuring the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.\n\n=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===\n[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]\nOn March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.\n\nThe building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.\n\n[[File:2013-08-18--14.46.12-tpl.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the west-northwest, the Chatham County Court House in August 2013, having been rebuilt after a fire destroyed the upper floors and clock tower.]]\nThe fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]].

Clermont's name is taken from a [[Prefectures in France|prefecture in France]] notable as the home of [[Celts|Celtic]] leader [[Vercingetorix]] who led the unified [[Gauls|Gallic]] resistance to [[Gallic Wars|Roman invasion]].  Clermont connotes \"clear mountain,\" which described the area when it was first viewed through the thick [[Ohio River]] [[fog]] by [[Age of Discovery|French explorers]] in the 1600s.  Clermont's peoplification dates to the [[Paleoindians|Paleoindian]], [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]], and [[Fort Ancient culture|Fort Ancient]] cultures.  The [[Gatch Site]] and other sites provide glimpses into what life was like for these otherwise mysterious people.  The [[Shawnee|Shawondasee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Lenape]], [[Mingo]], [[Odawa]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] each have or had a presence in Clermont.\n\nAt its ordinance in 1800 by the [[History of Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] to reward Virginian military veterans with land [[bounty (reward)|bounties]], Clermont encompassed twenty-three current Ohio counties and over 4.2 million acres of dense [[old-growth forest]].  The first [[deed]] was issued on 20 February 1796.  [[George Washington]] owned three parcels of land in Clermont County, whose first capital was [[Williamsburg, Ohio|Williamsburg]], founded by [[Lytle family|William Lytle]], and like [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]], was founded in 1796.  A stone dairy house, constructed in 1800, is thought to be the oldest standing building in Clermont.  The edifice is located beside Harmony Hill on South Third Street in Williamsburg.  Harmony Hill, one of the area's first farms, was built by William Lytle.\n\nThe last [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] village was located two miles south of Marathon in Jackson Township, along the mouth of Grassy Run on the East Fork of the Little Miami River.  The site saw the largest frontier battle in Clermont, the Battle of Grassy Run, during which pioneer [[Simon Kenton]] clashed with chief [[Tecumseh]] on April 10, 1792.  The Wyandot lived at this site until 1811.  The Bullskin Trail, once a major American Indian trail, runs north and south through Clermont along [[Ohio State Route 133|Ohio Route 133]], and was used by frontiersmen Kenton and [[Daniel Boone]] on hunting and warfare expeditions.\n\nIn 1823, [[New Richmond, Ohio|New Richmond]] became the capital, and in 1824, it moved to [[Batavia, Ohio|Batavia]], the current capital.  Clermont's [[Moscow, Ohio|Moscow]] became the exiled home of French royalty during the early 1800s, including future [[King of the French|King of France]] [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1815 and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] in 1825.<ref>Spate House of Moscow, Ohio.

Clermont's name is taken from a [[Prefectures in France|prefecture in France]] notable as the home of [[Celts|Celtic]] leader [[Vercingetorix]] who led the unified [[Gauls|Gallic]] resistance to [[Gallic Wars|Roman invasion]].  Clermont connotes \"clear mountain,\" which described the area when it was first viewed through the thick [[Ohio River]] [[fog]] by [[Age of Discovery|French explorers]] in the 1600s.  Clermont's peoplification dates to the [[Paleoindians|Paleoindian]], [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]], and [[Fort Ancient culture|Fort Ancient]] cultures.  The [[Gatch Site]] and other sites provide glimpses into what life was like for these otherwise mysterious people.  The [[Shawnee|Shawondasee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Lenape]], [[Mingo]], [[Odawa]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] each have or had a presence in Clermont.\n\nAt its ordinance in 1800 by the [[History of Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] to reward Virginian military veterans with land [[bounty (reward)|bounties]], Clermont encompassed twenty-three current Ohio counties and over 4.2 million acres of dense [[old-growth forest]].  The first [[deed]] was issued on 20 February 1796.  [[George Washington]] owned three parcels of land in Clermont County, whose first capital was [[Williamsburg, Ohio|Williamsburg]], founded by [[Lytle family|William Lytle]], and like [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]], was founded in 1796.  A stone dairy house, constructed in 1800, is thought to be the oldest standing building in Clermont.  The edifice is located beside Harmony Hill on South Third Street in Williamsburg.  Harmony Hill, one of the area's first farms, was built by William Lytle.\n\nThe last [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] village was located two miles south of Marathon in Jackson Township, along the mouth of Grassy Run on the East Fork of the Little Miami River.  The site saw the largest frontier battle in Clermont, the Battle of Grassy Run, during which pioneer [[Simon Kenton]] clashed with chief [[Tecumseh]] on April 10, 1792.  The Wyandot lived at this site until 1811.  The Bullskin Trail, once a major American Indian trail, runs north and south through Clermont along [[Ohio State Route 133|Ohio Route 133]], and was used by frontiersmen Kenton and [[Daniel Boone]] on hunting and warfare expeditions.\n\nIn 1823, [[New Richmond, Ohio|New Richmond]] became the capital, and in 1824, it moved to [[Batavia, Ohio|Batavia]], the current capital.  Clermont's [[Moscow, Ohio|Moscow]] became the exiled home of French royalty during the early 1800s, including future [[King of the French|King of France]] [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1815 and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] in 1825.<ref>Spate House of Moscow, Ohio.

Among the locations was Clermont County, Ohio, listed for its many fruiting trees and the early influence of American Indians who built earthen mounds in the form of serpents.  Subsequently, prominent men from Hamilton County dedicated [[Eden Park (Cincinnati)|Eden Park]] to honor the distinction.\n\nPattison became the first Clermont Countian elected Governor of Ohio in 1905, Ohio's first [[Ohio Democratic Party|Democratic]] governor of the twentieth century.  Pattison lived in Milford, and at a time before the influence of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], governed from his home called the [[Promont]], which was used as the official governor's residence.

The county was a bellwether from 1912 to 1936. But starting with the 1940 election, it has become a Republican stronghold with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] being the lone Democrat to win since. Clermont has been visited by recent national ticket candidates from both predominant parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckeyefirearms.org/join-bfa-endorsee-sarah-palin-four-road-victory-rallies-ohio-Sunday|title=Join Buckeye Firearm Endorsee Sarah Palin For Four Rallies Sunday|accessdate=2017-02-22|publisher=Cincinnati Nature Center}}</ref><ref>[https://my.barackobama.com/page/s/vp-biden-milford-sept-9 \"See Vice President Joe Biden in Milford.\"] Obama For America, www.barackobama.com</ref><ref>[http://www.fox19.com/story/19475567/joe-biden-vice-president-to-make-campaign-stop-in-milford-oh \"VP Joe Biden to make campaign stop in Milford.\"]  Fox19, Digital Media Staff.
