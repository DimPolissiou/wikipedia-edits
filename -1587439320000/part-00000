The regiment was organized in New York City in May 1861 as a [[Zouave]] regiment, known for its unusual dress and drill style,  by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Elmer E.

The regiment suffered extensive casualties during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] during the fighting on [[Henry House Hill]] and while serving as the rear guard for the retreating Union Army.\n\nThe regiment would later be stationed near [[Hampton Roads]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]], but experienced little fighting. Sent back to New York City in May 1862, the regiment was mustered out of service on June 2, 1862. There were several attempts to reorganize as a [[light infantry]] regiment through the summer of 1863, and many new enlistees were involved in suppressing the [[New York Draft Riots]] but those efforts failed and the enlistees were transferred to the [[17th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].\n\n==Organization and muster==\nOn April 15, 1861, President Lincoln issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|calling for 75,000 ninety-day enlistments]] to \"repossess the forts, places, and property which have been seized from the Union.\"<ref name=\"OfficialReports1\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0122%2F&tif=00080.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0122\n  | title = Official Reports, Correspondence\n  | publisher = United States Department of War\n  | year = 1889\n  | work=The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series III, Volume I\n  | accessdate = April 17, 2008\n}}</ref> That day, Lincoln wrote Ellsworth asking for his assistance in raising a regiment.<ref>Randall (1960), p. 229.</ref> Ellsworth had known the president well, from having assisted in organizing his [[1860 United States presidential election|campaign for the presidency]] in 1860<ref name=\"medalofhonor4\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.medalofhonor.com/ElmerEllsworth.htm\n  | title = Elmer Ellsworth\n  | publisher = Medal of Honor.com\n  | accessdate = December 4, 2007\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083729/http://www.medalofhonor.com/ElmerEllsworth.htm |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> and received a commission to organize the 11th New York Infantry as a 90-day regiment.

He never achieved his dream of attending West Point, as he could not gain the needed sponsorship. He was introduced to the famous French Zouaves through the teachings of his fencing instructor, Charles DeVillers, a former French Zouave.  Ellsworth introduced this [[drill team]] to the flashy [[Zouave]] uniforms and drill that emulated French colonial troops in [[Algeria]] and turned the group, renamed the U.S. Zouave Cadets, into a national champion drill team. A national tour in 1860 brought Ellsworth to the attention of Abraham Lincoln, for whom the unit performed hundreds of military drill movements with their muskets and bayonets.<ref name=\"cadets\">{{cite web | url = http://www.us-civilwar.com/ellsworth.htm | title = Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth | publisher = Aldie's Civil War Weekly | accessdate = December 18, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021181332/http://us-civilwar.com/ellsworth.htm |archivedate = October 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhen a civil war seemed unavoidable, Ellsworth proceeded to New York City to recruit his own regiment from the city's volunteer fire companies, stating: \"I want the New York Firemen, for there are no more effective men in the country, and none with whom I can do so much. They are sleeping on a volcano at Washington and I want men who can go into a fight now.\"<ref>Ingraham (1925), p. 127.</ref>  Two days after his arrival, Ellsworth awarded officer commissions to several foremen of the volunteer fire companies and began recruiting in earnest.\n\nWithin four days, 2,300 men had answered Ellsworth's call. A selection of only the most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength.<ref name=\"Ingraham\">Ingraham (1925), p. 128.</ref> When the state could not afford to supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of [[Sharps rifle]]s, and provisions.<ref name=\"Ingraham\"/>\n\nNews media covered the regiment's formation:\n\n{{blockquote|More work has been done in six days than seemed possible. The men have been mustered into service; the officers elected; the uniforms made, and on Sunday afternoon eleven hundred as efficient and hardy soldiers as ever handled a gun, will start for the scene of rebellion. Col. Ellsworth arrived in this city on Thursday of last week. On Friday he called together a number of the principal men of the department. On Saturday he selected his officers. On Sunday he mustered one thousand men. On Monday he drilled them.<ref name=\"newclippings\"/>}}\n\nLike most Zouave regiments, the men of the 11th New York were fashioned in uniforms not typical of the standard ensemble of a Union soldier. During their service, the 11th New York wore two different style of uniforms, the first issued during the forming of the regiment and the second shortly before the Battle of Bull Run. The initial uniforms were purchased with funds donated by the Union Defense Committee.<ref name=\"Ingraham\"/> They were based on Ellsworth's own design.   They consisted of light gray jackets of a [[chasseur]] style, with dark blue and red trim along with gray trousers of a jeans cloth material with a blue stripe running down the seam, and tan leather leggings.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith (1996), p. 57</ref> Along with their gray uniforms, they wore red kepis with a blue band and also received a red fez with a blue tassel, military-issue shirt and/or overshirts.  Many Zouaves went off to war wearing the fire badge of their respective fire company.  Contrary to modern art prints, the Fire Zouaves did not go off to war wearing fireman's belts or paint mottos on their fezzes.<ref>Smith (1996), pp. 57&ndash;58</ref> The second uniform was issued when the first, not made of quality materials, fell apart on most men.<ref name=\"Smith_2\">Smith (1996), p. 58</ref> This uniform was issued by the federal government, and to the disgust of the men, was not of the true Zouave style, but an American Zouave style. The new uniform had a dark blue Zouave jacket with red cuffs and red trimming with sky blue trimming inside the red. Blue [[Fez (hat)|fezzes]] with blue tassels were issued to provide greater flair to the uniform, as well as dark blue sashes, an issue of red overshirts (not firemen's shirts), and dark blue trousers.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>  Before the First Battle of Bull Run, most of the Zouaves left their jackets in camp due to the July heat, however, they all retained their blue and red fezzes, and their red blue banded kepis.  A number of havelocks were also issued to the regiment.\nBefore the regiment departed from New York City on April 29, 1861, its members were reviewed by General [[John Adams Dix]], Ambassador [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (1810\u20131903)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]] of Kentucky, as well as other members of the city and its fire department.<ref>Ingraham (1925), p. 130.</ref>  Soon after, they marched through the streets escorted by 5,000 firemen. Along the way, they received from the fire department a large white flag measuring {{convert|68|in|m}} by {{convert|54|in|m}} to serve as the regimental colors. Charlotte Augusta Gibbes also presented the unit with a flag.<ref name=\"Smith_2\"/><ref>Ingraham (1925), pp. 130, 132.</ref> Unbeknownst to the regiment, Washington D.C. had postponed their departure because they did not comply with army regulations.

The regiment suffered extensive casualties during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] during the fighting on [[Henry House Hill]] and while serving as the rear guard for the retreating Union Army.\n\nThe regiment would later be stationed near [[Hampton Roads]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]], but experienced little fighting.

Ellsworth introduced this [[drill team]] to the flashy [[Zouave]] uniforms and drill that emulated French colonial troops in [[Algeria]] and turned the group, renamed the U.S. Zouave Cadets, into a national champion drill team.

During their service, the 11th New York wore two different style of uniforms, the first issued during the forming of the regiment and the second shortly before the Battle of Bull Run. The initial uniforms were purchased with funds donated by the Union Defense Committee.<ref name=\"Ingraham\"/> They were based on Ellsworth's own design.   They consisted of light gray jackets of a [[chasseur]] style, with dark blue and red trim along with gray trousers of a jeans cloth material with a blue stripe running down the seam, and tan leather leggings.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith (1996), p. 57</ref> Along with their gray uniforms, they wore red kepis with a blue band and also received a red fez with a blue tassel, military-issue shirt and/or overshirts.  Many Zouaves went off to war wearing the fire badge of their respective fire company.  Contrary to modern art prints, the Fire Zouaves did not go off to war wearing fireman's belts or paint mottos on their fezzes.<ref>Smith (1996), pp. 57&ndash;58</ref> The second uniform was issued when the first, not made of quality materials, fell apart on most men.<ref name=\"Smith_2\">Smith (1996), p. 58</ref> This uniform was issued by the federal government, and to the disgust of the men, was not of the true Zouave style, but an American Zouave style. The new uniform had a dark blue Zouave jacket with red cuffs and red trimming with sky blue trimming inside the red. Blue [[Fez (hat)|fezzes]] with blue tassels were issued to provide greater flair to the uniform, as well as dark blue sashes, an issue of red overshirts (not firemen's shirts), and dark blue trousers.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>  Before the First Battle of Bull Run, most of the Zouaves left their jackets in camp due to the July heat, however, they all retained their blue and red fezzes, and their red blue banded kepis.  A number of havelocks were also issued to the regiment.\nBefore the regiment departed from New York City on April 29, 1861, its members were reviewed by General [[John Adams Dix]], Ambassador [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (1810\u20131903)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]] of Kentucky, as well as other members of the city and its fire department.<ref>Ingraham (1925), p. 130.</ref>  Soon after, they marched through the streets escorted by 5,000 firemen.

Departures. 2002, 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\nFrom an early age, she was interested in archaeology and art history, encouraged experts who frequented her parents' home, such as Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[James Rorimer]] and archaeologist [[Gisela Richter]].<ref> Bob Morris: In Iris Love\u2019s Wide Circle of Friends. In: The New York Times. 2. May 2012, 30. June 2014, Lincoln Evening Journal, 9 November 1970 </ref> \n\nLove completed her Bachelor of Arts at [[Smith College]], which included a year abroad at the [[University of Florence]]. During the pursuit of her bachelor's thesis in Italy, she compared Etruscan warrior figures at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Florence]] with those at the Met in New York and concluded the latter was housing fakes. Out of respect for her connections in New York, she initially hesitated to publish her substantiations, and decided to warn them when she was ready to release the findings in 1960. The museum retaliated by announcing the forgeries to ''[[The New York Times]]'', without acknowledging her work.<ref>Iris Love in the Internet Movie Database (English)</ref> \n\nLove never finished the beginnings of her doctorate at [[New York University]], instead working on an excavation on the island of [[Samothrace]] in the Aegean Sea from 1957 to 1965. She later became assistant professor at C.W. Post Long Island University ([[LIU Post]]).<ref> Finger im Staub. Nomen est omen: Eine Dame namens Love entdeckte den Tempel der Liebe. Der Spiegel 4/1970. 19 January 1970, published 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\n== Knidos and controversy ==\n\nLove is perhaps best known for her archaeological work in [[Knidos]], which began when she traveled there with Turkish archaeologist A\u015fk\u0131dil Akarca and continued after raising funds from Long Island University for further excavation on an annual basis. In 1969, her team discovered a foundation that Love thought was the remains of the Temple of [[Aphrodite]], confirming the instinct with inscriptions found the following year.<ref> Christine Mitchell Havelock: The Aphrodite of Knidos and her successors. A historical review of the female nude in Greek art. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor 1995, {{ISBN|0-472-10585-X}}, S. 60\u201361. </ref> \n\nThe discovery attracted international media attention when it was presented at the annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], and attracted many famous guests to the excavation site, including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bianca Jagger]]. This fanfare called Love's interpretation into question, with critics accusing her of converting the excavation into an exclusive holiday spot. \n\nThe year 1970 also found Love involved in another controversial research discussion. She believed she had found the original head of Aphrodite by the artist [[Praxiteles]] in the depots of the [[British Museum]], which would have been one of the most spectacular discoveries in the history of ancient art. Greco-Roman Curator [[Bernard Ashmole]] vehemently contested this interpretation (and the implication that he had overlooked the masterpiece by then), stirring a dispute in the press. With this rebuke, Love concentrated on the search for the statue in continued excavations, with numerous deep search trenches created that still shape the area of \u200b\u200bancient Knidos.<ref> Christine Bruns-\u00d6zgan: Knidos.

She subsequently retired from archeology, living between Greece, Italy, and New York where she lived for many years with the well-known tabloid journalist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] and devoted herself to breeding [[dachshund]]s, for which she won several prizes.<ref> Judy Wieder: Liz Smith Tells on Herself.

Departures. 2002, 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\nFrom an early age, she was interested in archaeology and art history, encouraged experts who frequented her parents' home, such as Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[James Rorimer]] and archaeologist [[Gisela Richter]].<ref> Bob Morris: In Iris Love\u2019s Wide Circle of Friends. In: The New York Times. 2. May 2012, 30. June 2014, Lincoln Evening Journal, 9 November 1970 </ref> \n\nLove completed her Bachelor of Arts at [[Smith College]], which included a year abroad at the [[University of Florence]]. During the pursuit of her bachelor's thesis in Italy, she compared Etruscan warrior figures at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Florence]] with those at the Met in New York and concluded the latter was housing fakes. Out of respect for her connections in New York, she initially hesitated to publish her substantiations, and decided to warn them when she was ready to release the findings in 1960. The museum retaliated by announcing the forgeries to ''[[The New York Times]]'', without acknowledging her work.<ref>Iris Love in the Internet Movie Database (English)</ref> \n\nLove never finished the beginnings of her doctorate at [[New York University]], instead working on an excavation on the island of [[Samothrace]] in the Aegean Sea from 1957 to 1965. She later became assistant professor at C.W. Post Long Island University ([[LIU Post]]).<ref> Finger im Staub. Nomen est omen: Eine Dame namens Love entdeckte den Tempel der Liebe. Der Spiegel 4/1970. 19 January 1970, published 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\n== Knidos and controversy ==\n\nLove is perhaps best known for her archaeological work in [[Knidos]], which began when she traveled there with Turkish archaeologist A\u015fk\u0131dil Akarca and continued after raising funds from Long Island University for further excavation on an annual basis. In 1969, her team discovered a foundation that Love thought was the remains of the Temple of [[Aphrodite]], confirming the instinct with inscriptions found the following year.<ref> Christine Mitchell Havelock: The Aphrodite of Knidos and her successors. A historical review of the female nude in Greek art. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor 1995, {{ISBN|0-472-10585-X}}, S. 60\u201361. </ref> \n\nThe discovery attracted international media attention when it was presented at the annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], and attracted many famous guests to the excavation site, including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bianca Jagger]]. This fanfare called Love's interpretation into question, with critics accusing her of converting the excavation into an exclusive holiday spot. \n\nThe year 1970 also found Love involved in another controversial research discussion. She believed she had found the original head of Aphrodite by the artist [[Praxiteles]] in the depots of the [[British Museum]], which would have been one of the most spectacular discoveries in the history of ancient art. Greco-Roman Curator [[Bernard Ashmole]] vehemently contested this interpretation (and the implication that he had overlooked the masterpiece by then), stirring a dispute in the press. With this rebuke, Love concentrated on the search for the statue in continued excavations, with numerous deep search trenches created that still shape the area of \u200b\u200bancient Knidos.<ref> Christine Bruns-\u00d6zgan: Knidos.

She subsequently retired from archeology, living between Greece, Italy, and New York where she lived for many years with the well-known tabloid journalist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] and devoted herself to breeding [[dachshund]]s, for which she won several prizes.<ref> Judy Wieder: Liz Smith Tells on Herself.

Sounds, visuals, and even the iconic score of the films have become integral components in American society. The film helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making [[science fiction film]]s a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster genre]].<ref name=Cook>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David A.|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970\u20131979|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23265-8|edition=1st paperback print.}}{{Page needed|date=June 2016}}</ref> This impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s \"[[Blue Harvest]]\" special, [[Seth Green]]'s \"[[Robot Chicken: Star Wars]]\", and Lucas's self-proclaimed favorite parody, ''[[Hardware Wars]]'' by [[Ernie Fosselius]].\n\n==Arts==\n===Filmmaking history===\n\n====Financial impact on Fox====\n[[20th Century Fox]] optioned ''Star Wars''. When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the [[Aspen Skiing Company|Aspen skiing]] and [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach golf]] corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977. Income from ''Star Wars'' re-releases, sequels, and merchandising enriched the studio in the following decades. ''Star Wars'' helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.<ref name=Cook/>\n\n====Impact on filmmaking====\n''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films,<ref name=Bigsby>{{cite book|last1=Bigsby|first1=Christopher|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-84132-1|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.<ref name=Bigsby/> ''Star Wars'' was also important in the movement towards the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] in films.<ref name=\"chicago\"/> The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in [[special effect]]s. Companies like [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Digital Productions]] were created to provide them. The 1977 ''Star Wars'' pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In ''Star Wars'', the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic.<ref name=Cook/> Along with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.<ref name=\"chicago\"/><ref name=pbs/> It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself.<ref name=msn/>\n\nThe holographic video effect associated with ''Star Wars'' served as a technological tool for [[CNN]] during its 2008 Election Night coverage. CNN reporter [[Jessica Yellin]] and musician [[will.i.am]] looked as though they were in the network's [[New York City]] studios talking face-to-face with hosts [[Anderson Cooper]] and [[Wolf Blitzer]], when in reality, they were in [[Chicago]] at [[Barack Obama]]'s rally. The process involved Yellin and will.i.am standing in front of a blue screen in a special tent, while being shot by 35 HD cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com:80/entertainment/tv/chi-cnn-hologram-081104-story,0,2621692.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108053032/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/chi-cnn-hologram-081104-story%2C0%2C2621692.story |archivedate=November 8, 2008 |title=The Watcher: Freaky CNN hologram recalls 'Star Wars' - chicagotribune.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2016-06-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAnother impact Star Wars made on film making was its use of the \"[[Monomyth]]\" or \"[[The hero's journey|The Hero's Journey]]\" found in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]].'' While George Lucas wrote through 4 drafts of the film, between the first and second drafts, he read Joseph Campbell's book titled ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces.''

In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries.

When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the [[Aspen Skiing Company|Aspen skiing]] and [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach golf]] corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977.

Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.<ref name=Bigsby/> ''Star Wars'' was also important in the movement towards the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] in films.<ref name=\"chicago\"/> The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in [[special effect]]s. Companies like [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Digital Productions]] were created to provide them. The 1977 ''Star Wars'' pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In ''Star Wars'', the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic.<ref name=Cook/> Along with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.<ref name=\"chicago\"/><ref name=pbs/> It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself.<ref name=msn/>\n\nThe holographic video effect associated with ''Star Wars'' served as a technological tool for [[CNN]] during its 2008 Election Night coverage.

In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries.

Research typically engages with various media forms, official documents or [[white papers]], and text found in food production sites - markets, production facilities, restaurants, etc. This generally entails the empirical analysis of words and [[phrases]] (eg.

Furthermore, such research broaches [[psycholinguistics]] by noting that these different groups demonstrate differing capacities to subconsciously alter their taste perceptions based on languages in food labels. Existing linguistic research on food labelling and health also addresses objective meal sizes, nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat\u201d), health benefit claims (e.g., \u201cmay increase bone density\u201d; and brand names. <ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref>\n\n==== Product labelling and Environmentalism ====\nCulinary linguistics further delineates ties with the social and environmental facets of food politics.

Difficult foreign words (\u201ctonnarelli\u201d, \u201cchoclo\u201d, \u201cbastilla\u201d, \u201cpersillade\u201d, \u201coyako\u201d) are an implicit signal of the high-educational status of the menu writer and, by extension, the customer \u2026 expensive menus were shorter and more implicit. By contrast, the wordy menus of middle-priced restaurants were stuffed with adjectives (\u201cfresh\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cmild\u201d, \u201ccrisp\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201cgolden brown\u201d), while positive but vague words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201csavoury\u201d were used by the cheapest restaurants; high-status restaurants want their customers to presuppose that food will be fresh, crisp and delicious. The surfeit of adjectives on middle-priced menus is thus a kind of overcompensation, a sign of status anxiety, and only the cheapest restaurants, in which the tastiness of the food might be in question, must overly protest the toothsomeness of their treats.\u201d\n\n=== Food Reviews ===\nFood reviews (see [[food critic]]) are written to provide feedback about [[foodservice]] in [[restaurants]]. For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref>\n\n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories. Diemer and Frobenius distinguish the vocabulary on food blogs into seven categories: 1) food jargon such as recipe or food 2)  ingredients, food and recipe types, such as salt or cream 3) non-English terms like vollkorn and gelato 4) kitchen tools, for example bowl and pan 5) preparation methods, such as heat and bake 6)amounts and measures, like cup or minutes 7) blog-specific terminology such as comments or post. <ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\"></ref>\n\n==== Culinary verb use ====\nThe most common non-auxiliary verbs (see [[auxiliary verb]]) are action verbs that describe activities in the lexical field of [[cooking]], like make, add, cook, serve, take, chop, bake or fry. In addition, there are activities related to food procurement, such as buy or pick, and consumption, such as eat.\n\n=== Recipes ===\n\n[[Recipes]] may come in written or spoken form. Written recipes are considered procedural discourse, which is agency neutral and time neutral.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wharton|first1 = Tim|year= 2012|title=Recipes: Beyond the Words|journal=Gastronomica:The Journal for Food Studies ,Vol.10No.4|pages=67-73|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|doi= 10.1525/gfc.2010.10.4.67)}}</ref> \u201cThis agency/ time neutrality is reflected in the use of the imperative form\u201d, which has no overt subject and no grammatical tense in English. Spoken recipes can be likened to narratives and sets of instructions, as they \u201ctend to switch back and forth between the first person past tense of the former and the second person imperative of the latter <ref>{{cite journal |last= Norrick |first= Neal |date= 2011 |title= Conversational Recipe Telling |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010|journal= Journal of Pragmatics |volume=43|issue=11 |pages= 2740\u20132761  |doi= 10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010 |access-date= March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooking Shows === \n\n[[Cooking show]]s or cookery programmes are forms of spoken discourse in culinary linguistics. It involves the performance of food preparation in front of a live or television audience by a host, typically, a [[celebrity chef]]. \n\n==== Instructions ====\nAn essential part of cooking shows is the delivery of instructions during food preparation. Such instructions are usually influenced by the linguistic styles of different celebrity chef personalities. For example, British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] is known for employing slang in his performance of culinary speech. He often substitutes the traditional terms like \u201cto add\u201d with a slang verb, \u201cto chuck\u201d (meaning \u2018to throw\u2019).\n\n==== Expressing Emotions ====\nThe medium of television allows for emotions in culinary discourse to be conveyed through visual and aural signifiers. \n\n===== Visual language =====\nThe use of facial expressions and [[body language]] are visual ways in which emotions arising from food preparation and consumption are communicated to the audience.\n\u201c In humans, the characteristic facial expressions that coincide with the experience of disgust and distaste include behaviors such as gaping and nose wrinkling, are usually elicited by nausea or revulsion. These negative expressions are typically evoked by unpalatable tastes, such as bitter, both in children and in adults. Palatable tastes, such as [[sucrose]], are thought to induce sensory pleasure, which elicits less frequently expressed appetitive reactions, such as facial relaxation and smiling and sucking movements.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Forestell|first1= Catherine A|last2= Menella|first2= Julie A|year= 2012|title=The Relationship between Infant Facial Expressions and Food Acceptance|journal=Curr Nutr Rep|pages= 141-147|publisher=PMC|doi= 10.1007/s13668-017-0205-y)}}</ref>\n\n===== Verbal language =====\nIn terms of verbal cues, vocal sounds such as groaning [\u201cmmmm\u201d sound] often denote a sense of satisfaction and pleasure towards the consumption of food. The personification of food is also a linguistic technique of establishing intimacy and emotional connection in the performance of food preparation and consumption. This may sometimes involve interaction between chefs and their culinary creation. \n\n\u201cJamie is bending the spaghettini so that they will fit tightly into the pan into the boiling water, and as he does so, he addresses the pasta as if it were one of his \u201cmates\u201d: We\u2019ve got some quite good quality pasta here, right, so this is spaghettini it cooks in around 7 minutes right so this goes in boiling salted water it\u2019s supposed to be, just bend it around, get in there, go on mate, get in there,here we go\u2026\u201d \n<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Gerdhardt |editor-first=Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first=Maximiliane|editor3-last=Ley|editor3-first=Susanne|title=Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=July 4, 2013 |pages=53-82 |chapter= Passionate about food: Jamie and Nigella and the performance of food-talk |isbn=978-9027202932}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref>\n\n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories. Diemer and Frobenius distinguish the vocabulary on food blogs into seven categories: 1) food jargon such as recipe or food 2)  ingredients, food and recipe types, such as salt or cream 3) non-English terms like vollkorn and gelato 4) kitchen tools, for example bowl and pan 5) preparation methods, such as heat and bake 6)amounts and measures, like cup or minutes 7) blog-specific terminology such as comments or post. <ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\"></ref>\n\n==== Culinary verb use ====\nThe most common non-auxiliary verbs (see [[auxiliary verb]]) are action verbs that describe activities in the lexical field of [[cooking]], like make, add, cook, serve, take, chop, bake or fry. In addition, there are activities related to food procurement, such as buy or pick, and consumption, such as eat.\n\n=== Recipes ===\n\n[[Recipes]] may come in written or spoken form. Written recipes are considered procedural discourse, which is agency neutral and time neutral.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wharton|first1 = Tim|year= 2012|title=Recipes: Beyond the Words|journal=Gastronomica:The Journal for Food Studies ,Vol.10No.4|pages=67-73|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|doi= 10.1525/gfc.2010.10.4.67)}}</ref> \u201cThis agency/ time neutrality is reflected in the use of the imperative form\u201d, which has no overt subject and no grammatical tense in English. Spoken recipes can be likened to narratives and sets of instructions, as they \u201ctend to switch back and forth between the first person past tense of the former and the second person imperative of the latter <ref>{{cite journal |last= Norrick |first= Neal |date= 2011 |title= Conversational Recipe Telling |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010|journal= Journal of Pragmatics |volume=43|issue=11 |pages= 2740\u20132761  |doi= 10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010 |access-date= March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooking Shows === \n\n[[Cooking show]]s or cookery programmes are forms of spoken discourse in culinary linguistics. It involves the performance of food preparation in front of a live or television audience by a host, typically, a [[celebrity chef]]. \n\n==== Instructions ====\nAn essential part of cooking shows is the delivery of instructions during food preparation. Such instructions are usually influenced by the linguistic styles of different celebrity chef personalities. For example, British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] is known for employing slang in his performance of culinary speech. He often substitutes the traditional terms like \u201cto add\u201d with a slang verb, \u201cto chuck\u201d (meaning \u2018to throw\u2019).\n\n==== Expressing Emotions ====\nThe medium of television allows for emotions in culinary discourse to be conveyed through visual and aural signifiers. \n\n===== Visual language =====\nThe use of facial expressions and [[body language]] are visual ways in which emotions arising from food preparation and consumption are communicated to the audience.\n\u201c In humans, the characteristic facial expressions that coincide with the experience of disgust and distaste include behaviors such as gaping and nose wrinkling, are usually elicited by nausea or revulsion. These negative expressions are typically evoked by unpalatable tastes, such as bitter, both in children and in adults. Palatable tastes, such as [[sucrose]], are thought to induce sensory pleasure, which elicits less frequently expressed appetitive reactions, such as facial relaxation and smiling and sucking movements.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Forestell|first1= Catherine A|last2= Menella|first2= Julie A|year= 2012|title=The Relationship between Infant Facial Expressions and Food Acceptance|journal=Curr Nutr Rep|pages= 141-147|publisher=PMC|doi= 10.1007/s13668-017-0205-y)}}</ref>\n\n===== Verbal language =====\nIn terms of verbal cues, vocal sounds such as groaning [\u201cmmmm\u201d sound] often denote a sense of satisfaction and pleasure towards the consumption of food. The personification of food is also a linguistic technique of establishing intimacy and emotional connection in the performance of food preparation and consumption. This may sometimes involve interaction between chefs and their culinary creation. \n\n\u201cJamie is bending the spaghettini so that they will fit tightly into the pan into the boiling water, and as he does so, he addresses the pasta as if it were one of his \u201cmates\u201d: We\u2019ve got some quite good quality pasta here, right, so this is spaghettini it cooks in around 7 minutes right so this goes in boiling salted water it\u2019s supposed to be, just bend it around, get in there, go on mate, get in there,here we go\u2026\u201d \n<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Gerdhardt |editor-first=Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first=Maximiliane|editor3-last=Ley|editor3-first=Susanne|title=Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=July 4, 2013 |pages=53-82 |chapter= Passionate about food: Jamie and Nigella and the performance of food-talk |isbn=978-9027202932}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]].{{awkward|date=April 2020}} Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]].

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome. As late as the reign of Pope [[Benedict VII]] (974\u2013983), a new [[Archdiocese of Carthage|Archbishop of Carthage]] was consecrated. From the 10th century, Christianity declined in the region.<ref>Insoll, T.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa.

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses.

This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century.

Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in Mediterranean trade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avner Greif | title = Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition | version = | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] in its journal [[American Economic Review]] | date= June 1993 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_Papers/SSRNAUG202008.pdf | access-date = 2007-07-11 | author-link = Avner Greif }}.

The Maghreb's variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) identifies several distinct [[ecoregion]]s in the Maghreb.\n\n====Mediterranean Maghreb====\n[[File:Chamaerops humilis argentea1.jpg|thumb|[[Chamaerops|Dwarf fan palm]], grown in Maghrebi countries]]\nThe portions of the Maghreb between the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], along with coastal [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] in Libya, are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]. These ecoregions share many species of plants and animals with other portions of [[Mediterranean Basin]].

Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals. The northern edge of the Sahara corresponds to the 100&nbsp;mm isohyet, which is also the northern range of the [[date palm]] ''(Phoenix dactylifera)''.<ref name=\"Wickens\"/>\n* [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]]: This ecoregion lies along the northern edge of the Sahara, next to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions of the Mediterranean Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south.

Among these is a culinary tradition that [[Habib Bourguiba]] defined as Western Arab, where [[couscous]] is the staple food, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where white rice is the staple food. In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

It consisted of three separate battles in the Chinese provinces of [[Henan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\nThese battles were the Japanese '''Operation Kogo''' or [[Battle of Central Henan]], '''Operation Togo 1''' or the [[Battle of Changheng]], and '''Operation Togo 2''' and '''Togo 3''', or the [[Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou]], respectively. The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to [[French Indochina]], and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.<ref>''The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive'', pg. 21</ref>\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the operation was also called '''''Tairiku Dats\u016b Sakusen''''' (\u5927\u9678\u6253\u901a\u4f5c\u6226), or \"Continent Cross-Through Operation\", while the Chinese refer to it as the '''Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi''' ({{zh|t=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u6703\u6230|s=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u4f1a\u6218|p=Y\u00f9 X\u012bang Gu\u00ec Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n}}).\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Japanese mechanized forces marching towards Lo-yang.jpg|thumb|left|1944 Operation Ichigo]]\nThere were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway|Pinghan Railway]] between [[Beijing]] and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of [[Liuzhou]], near the border with Japanese-held [[Indochina]]. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation.\n\nThe Japanese included [[Kwantung Army]] units and equipment from [[Manchukuo]], mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under [[Joseph Stilwell]] set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement.\n[[File:1944 Operation Ichigo IJA invaded Henan.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944]]\nIn [[Battle of Central Henan|Operation Kogo]], 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General [[Tang Enbo]] (\u6e6f\u6069\u4f2f), were deployed to defend the strategic position of [[Luoyang]]. <!-- What does \"strategic position\" mean here? Please clarify.--> The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the [[Yellow River]] around [[Zhengzhou]] in late April and defeated Chinese forces near [[Xuchang]], then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25.\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|left|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\nThe second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied [[Changsha]], [[Hengyang]], [[Guilin]] and [[Liuzhou]]. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of [[Mission 204]] to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]] often disrupted the [[Hunan\u2013Guangxi Railway]] between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\n\nThe [[XX Bomber Command]] operating Strategic [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] of the [[Twentieth Air Force]], which were attacking Japan in [[Operation Matterhorn]], were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the [[Marianas]] under the command of the newly established [[XXI Bomber Command]]. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo.\n\n===Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces===\nGeneral [[Jiang Dingwen]] of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=323\u2013324|quote=|via=}}</ref> This was revenge for the [[1938 Yellow River flood]] and the [[Chinese famine of 1942\u201343]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=271\u2013272, 326|quote=|via=}}</ref> Japanese actions would cause other famines in [[British India]] (The [[1943 Bengal famine|1943 Indian famine]] killed about 4 million Bengalis in [[Bengal]]<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33618621]</ref>.)

He was able to convince General [[George Marshall]] to have President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] send an ultimatum to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \"at once\" placed Stilwell \"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446\u2013447</ref>\n\nAn exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from [[Patrick Hurley]], Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292</ref> Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation and vassalization of China, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298</ref><ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452</ref>\nAs a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General [[Albert Wedemeyer]]. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] were divided up and allocated to other officers.\n\nAlthough Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] drama critic-turned-war correspondent [[Brooks Atkinson]] interviewed him in [[Chungking]] and wrote:<blockquote>The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China.  The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China\u2014actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{cite magazine\n| title      = Crisis\n| url        = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n| magazine  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine quoting ''[[The New York Times]]''\n| date       = 1944-11-13\n| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAtkinson, who had visited [[Mao Zedong]] in the communist capital of [[Yenan]], saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled ''Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City''), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].

White|Theodore White]], a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent in China at the time of the offensive, was based on an interview with former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Major Frank Gleason, who led a demolition group of American soldiers during the offensive that were charged with blowing up anything left behind in the retreat that might be of use to Japan. His group ultimately destroyed over 150 bridges and 50,000 tons of munitions, helping slow the Japanese advance.

It consisted of three separate battles in the Chinese provinces of [[Henan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\nThese battles were the Japanese '''Operation Kogo''' or [[Battle of Central Henan]], '''Operation Togo 1''' or the [[Battle of Changheng]], and '''Operation Togo 2''' and '''Togo 3''', or the [[Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou]], respectively. The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to [[French Indochina]], and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.<ref>''The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive'', pg. 21</ref>\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the operation was also called '''''Tairiku Dats\u016b Sakusen''''' (\u5927\u9678\u6253\u901a\u4f5c\u6226), or \"Continent Cross-Through Operation\", while the Chinese refer to it as the '''Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi''' ({{zh|t=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u6703\u6230|s=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u4f1a\u6218|p=Y\u00f9 X\u012bang Gu\u00ec Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n}}).\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Japanese mechanized forces marching towards Lo-yang.jpg|thumb|left|1944 Operation Ichigo]]\nThere were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway|Pinghan Railway]] between [[Beijing]] and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of [[Liuzhou]], near the border with Japanese-held [[Indochina]]. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation.\n\nThe Japanese included [[Kwantung Army]] units and equipment from [[Manchukuo]], mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under [[Joseph Stilwell]] set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement.\n[[File:1944 Operation Ichigo IJA invaded Henan.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944]]\nIn [[Battle of Central Henan|Operation Kogo]], 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General [[Tang Enbo]] (\u6e6f\u6069\u4f2f), were deployed to defend the strategic position of [[Luoyang]]. <!-- What does \"strategic position\" mean here? Please clarify.--> The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the [[Yellow River]] around [[Zhengzhou]] in late April and defeated Chinese forces near [[Xuchang]], then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25.\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|left|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\nThe second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied [[Changsha]], [[Hengyang]], [[Guilin]] and [[Liuzhou]]. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of [[Mission 204]] to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]] often disrupted the [[Hunan\u2013Guangxi Railway]] between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\n\nThe [[XX Bomber Command]] operating Strategic [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] of the [[Twentieth Air Force]], which were attacking Japan in [[Operation Matterhorn]], were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the [[Marianas]] under the command of the newly established [[XXI Bomber Command]]. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo.\n\n===Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces===\nGeneral [[Jiang Dingwen]] of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=323\u2013324|quote=|via=}}</ref> This was revenge for the [[1938 Yellow River flood]] and the [[Chinese famine of 1942\u201343]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=271\u2013272, 326|quote=|via=}}</ref> General Jiang's account also said: \"Actually this is truly painful for me to say: in the end the damages we suffered from the attacks by the people were more serious than the losses from battles with the enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=324|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Henan peasants picked up the weapons Kuomintang troops had abandoned to defend themselves against the Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=325|quote=|via=}}</ref> When the Kuomintang army ordered the Henan locals to destroy the local highways to prevent the Japanese advance, they refused.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=326|quote=|via=}}</ref> In fact they sometimes even went back at night and mended roads which the army had torn up by day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=326|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the rapid deterioration of the Chinese front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, General [[Joseph Stilwell]] saw this as an opportunity to win his political struggle against [[Chiang Kai-shek]], China's leader, and gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. He was able to convince General [[George Marshall]] to have President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] send an ultimatum to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \"at once\" placed Stilwell \"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446\u2013447</ref>\n\nAn exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from [[Patrick Hurley]], Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292</ref> Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation and vassalization of China, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298</ref><ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452</ref>\nAs a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General [[Albert Wedemeyer]]. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] were divided up and allocated to other officers.\n\nAlthough Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] drama critic-turned-war correspondent [[Brooks Atkinson]] interviewed him in [[Chungking]] and wrote:<blockquote>The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China.  The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China\u2014actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{cite magazine\n| title      = Crisis\n| url        = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n| magazine  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine quoting ''[[The New York Times]]''\n| date       = 1944-11-13\n| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAtkinson, who had visited [[Mao Zedong]] in the communist capital of [[Yenan]], saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled ''Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City''), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].
