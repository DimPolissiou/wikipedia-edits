Along with this belief came also the need for a Slavic umbrella language. A strong candidate for that position was [[Russian language|Russian]], the language of the largest (and during most of the 19th century the only) Slavic state and also mother tongue of more than half of the Slavs. This option enjoyed most of its popularity in Russia itself, but was also favoured by Pan-Slavists abroad, for example the Slovak [[\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far]].<ref name=\"Ruposova\">\u041b.\u041f. \u0420\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430'', in: ''\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430'' (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442, 2012 no. 1, p. 55. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Others believed that [[Old Church Slavonic]] was a better and also more neutral solution. In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in [[Orthodox church|Orthodox]] liturgy, where it played a role similar to [[Latin]] in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, [[Proto-Slavic]]. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], its grammar was complex, and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.\n\n=== Early projects ===\nThe first Interslavic grammar, ''Gramat\u00ed\u010dno izk\u00e2zanje ob r\u00faskom jez\u00edku'' by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107]], was written in 1665.<ref>Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, ''\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0431 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0443''. Moscow, 1665.</ref> He referred to the language as '''Ruski''', but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic]] and his own [[Ikavian \u010cakavian]] dialect of [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Kri\u017eani\u0107 used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise ''Politika'' (1663\u20131666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in ''Politika'' are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=\u0418\u0417 \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0413\u0412\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418 \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0418|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKri\u017eani\u0107 was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], had translated the ''Summa Doctrinae Christanae'' by [[Petrus Canisius]] into \"Slovignsky\",<ref>Petrus Canisius, \"Svmma navka christianskoga / sloxena castnim v\u010ditegliem Petrom Kanisiem; tvmacena iz latinskoga jazika v slovignsky, i vtisstena po zapoviedi presuetoga Otca Pape Gregoria Trinaestoga [...] Koie iz Vlasskoga, illi Latinskoga iazika, v Slouignsky Jazik protuma\u010dio iest pop Ssimvn Bvdineo Zadranin\".

In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the [[South Slavic languages]] there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]], that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of [[Matija Majar]] (1809\u20131892), a Slovenian [[Austroslavism|Austroslavist]] who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published [[Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski]] (\"Mutual Slavic Orthography\").<ref name=\"majar\">Matija Majar-Ziljski, ''Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski, to je: Uzajemna Slovnica ali Mluvnica Slavjanska''. Prague, 1865.</ref> In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was by taking their own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic (\"mutual\") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of [[Cyril and Methodius]]<ref name=\"brata\">Matija Majar Ziljski, ''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga''. Prague, 1864.</ref> and for a magazine he published in the years 1873\u20131875, ''Slavjan''.

They deplored the fact that these dialects had diverged beyond mutual comprehensibility, and the Pan-Slavic language they envisioned was intended to reverse this process.

In most cases they provided grammatical comparisons between the Slavic languages, sometimes but not always offering solutions they labelled as \"Pan-Slavic\". What their projects have in common that they neither have a rigidly prescriptive grammar, nor a separate vocabulary.\n\n=== The twentieth century ===\n[[File:Bohumil Holy.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Bohumil Hol\u00fd]]<br />(1885\u20131947)]]\nIn the early 20th century it had become clear that the divergence of the Slavic languages was irreversible and the concept of a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like [[Esperanto]], efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.<ref name=\"Meyer\" />{{RP|118}}\n\nIn the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands. In 1907 the Czech dialectologist [[Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek]] (1852\u20131919) published a grammar of '''Neuslavisch''', a proposal for a common literary language for all Slavs within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]].<ref>Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek, ''Grammatik der Neuslawischen Sprache''.

For that reason it gained little acceptance among Slavs: a high degree of simplification, characteristic for most international auxiliary languages, makes it easier to learn for non-Slavs, but widens the distance with the natural Slavic languages and gives the language an overly artificial character, which by many is considered a disadvantage.<ref name=\"narodna pravda\">{{cite web|url=http://narodna.pravda.com.ua/discussions/4a8f1e1b731fc/|script-title=uk:\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0428\u0442\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u041c\u043e\u0432\u0438: \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0432\u0430|publisher=Narodna.pravda.com.ua|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=uk}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, the '''Slovianski''' project was started by a group of people from different countries, who felt the need for a simple and neutral Slavic language that the Slavs could understand without prior learning.

It consists of elements that can be encountered in all or at least most of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://izviestija.info/index.php/nauka/195-zalozenja-za-medzuslovjanski-jezyk|title=Zalo\u017ee\u0148ja za med\u017euslovjanski jezyk|publisher=Izviestija.info|accessdate=11 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210133123/http://izviestija.info/index.php/nauka/195-zalozenja-za-medzuslovjanski-jezyk|archive-date=10 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Nouns ===\nInterslavic is an [[inflecting language]]. [[Noun]]s can have three [[gender (grammar)|genders]], two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative]]). Since several Slavic languages also have a [[vocative]], it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThere is no [[article (grammar)|article]]. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five [[declension]]s:\n* masculine nouns (ending in a \u2013 usually hard \u2013 [[consonant]]): ''dom'' \"house\", ''m\u0173\u017e'' \"man\"\n* feminine nouns ending in '''-a''': ''\u017eena'' \"woman\", ''zemja'' \"earth\"\n* feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant: ''kos\u0165'' \"bone\"\n* neuter nouns ending in '''-o''' or '''-e''': ''slovo'' \"word\", ''morje'' \"sea\"\n* Old Church Slavonic also had a consonantal declension that in most Slavic languages merged into the remaining declensions. Some Interslavic projects and writers preserve this declension, which consists of nouns of all three genders, mostly neuters:\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-m\u0119/-men-''': ''im\u0119/imene'' \"name\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-\u0119/-\u0119t-''' (children and young animals): ''tel\u0119/tel\u0119te'' \"calf\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-o/-es-''': ''nebo/nebese'' \"heaven\"\n** masculine nouns of the group '''-en-''': ''kame\u0144/kamene'' \"stone\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-\u00f2v''': ''c\u0155k\u00f2v/c\u0155kve'' \"church\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-i/-er-''': ''mati/matere'' \"mother\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Declension of nouns'''\n! rowspan=\"3\" |&nbsp;!! colspan=\"4\" | masculine !! colspan=\"2\" | neuter !! colspan=\"3\" | feminine !! colspan=\"3\" | consonantal\n|-\n! hard, animate !! hard, non-animate !! soft, animate !! soft, non-animate !! hard !! soft !! -a, hard !! -a, soft !! -\u00d8 !! m. !! n. !! f.\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | singular\n|-\n!

One can write ''dobrego'' instead of ''dobrogo'', ''sv\u011b\u017eogo'' instead of ''sv\u011b\u017eego''.\n\n==== Comparison ====\nThe [[comparative]] is formed with the ending '''-(\u011bj)\u0161i''': ''slab'''\u0161i''''' \"weaker\", ''p\u00f2ln'''\u011bj\u0161i''''' \"fuller\". The [[superlative]] is formed by adding the [[prefix]] '''naj-''' to the comparative: '''''naj'''slab'''\u0161i''''' \"weakest\". Comparatives can also be formed with the adverbs ''bolje'' or ''vy\u0161e'' \"more\", superlatives with the adverbs ''najbolje'' or ''najvy\u0161e'' \"most\".\n\n==== Adverbs ====\nHard adjectives can be turned into an adverb with the ending '''-o''', soft adjectives with the ending '''-e''': ''dobr'''o''''' \"well\", ''sv\u011b\u017e'''e''''' \"freshly\".

A [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.\n\nVerbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:<br />\n''d\u011blati ~ sd\u011blati'' \"to do\"<br />\n''\u010distiti ~ iz\u010distiti'' \"to clean\"<br />\n''pisati ~ napisati'' \"to write\"<br />\nBecause prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:\n* '''-ati''' becomes '''-yvati''' (e.g. ''zapisati ~ zapisyvati'' \"to note, to register, to record\", ''dokazati ~ dokazyvati'' \"to prove\")\n* '''-iti''' become '''-jati''' (e.g. ''napraviti ~ napravjati'' \"to lead\", ''pozvoliti ~ pozvaljati'' \"to allow\", ''oprostiti ~ opra\u0161\u0107ati'' \"to simplify\")\n\nSome aspect pairs are irregular, for example ''nazvati ~ nazyvati'' \"to name, to call\", ''prijdti ~ prihoditi'' \"to come\", ''podj\u0119ti ~ podimati'' \"to undertake\".\n\n==== Stems ====\nThe Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. To simplify these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal [[stem (linguistics)|stems]]. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:\n* the first stem is used for the [[infinitive]], the [[past tense]], the [[conditional mood]], the [[past passive participle]] and the [[verbal noun]]. It is formed by removing the ending '''-ti''' from the infinitive: ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011bla-'', ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''prosi-'', ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-''. Verbs ending in '''-sti''' can also have their stem ending on '''t''' or '''d''', f.ex. ''vesti > ved-'' \"to lead\", ''gnesti > gnet-'' \"to crush\".\n* the second stem is used for the [[present tense]], the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[present active participle]]. In most cases both stems are identical, and in most of the remaining cases the second stem can be derived regularly from the first. In particular cases they have to be learned separately. In the present tense, a distinction is made between two conjugations:\n** the first conjugation includes almost all verbs that do not have the ending '''-iti''', as well as monosyllabic verbs on '''-iti''':\n*** verbs on '''-ati''' have the stem '''-aj-''': ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011blaj-''\n*** verbs on '''-ovati''' have the stem '''-uj-''': ''kovati'' \"to forge\" > ''kuj-''\n*** verbs on '''-n\u0173ti''' have the stem '''-n-''': ''t\u0119gn\u0173ti'' \"to pull, to draw\" > ''t\u0119gn-''\n*** monosyllabic verbs have '''-j-''': ''piti'' \"to drink\" > ''pij-'', ''\u010duti'' \"to feel\" > ''\u010duj-''\n*** the second stem is identical to the first stem if the latter ends in a consonant: ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-'', ''vesti'' \"to lead\" > ''ved-''\n** the second conjugation includes all polysyllabic verbs on '''-iti''' and most verbs on '''-\u011bti''': ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''pros-i-'', ''vid\u011bti'' \"to see\" > ''vid-i-''\nThere are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: ''pisati'' \"to write\" > ''pi\u0161-'', ''spati'' \"to sleep\" > ''sp-i-'', ''zvati'' \"to call\" > ''zov-'', ''ht\u011bti'' \"to want\" > ''ho\u0107-''. In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.\n\n==== Conjugation ====\nThe various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:\n* ''Present tense'': '''-\u0173, -e\u0161, -e, -emo, -ete, -\u0173t''' (first conjugation); '''-j\u0173, -i\u0161, -i, -imo, -ite, -\u0119t''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past tense \u2013 simple'' (as in Russian): m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li'''\n* ''Past tense \u2013 complex'' (as in South Slavic):\n** ''Imperfect tense'': '''-h, -\u0161e, -\u0161e, -hmo, -ste, -h\u0173'''\n** ''Perfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the present tense of ''byti'' \"to be\"\n** ''Pluperfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the imperfect tense of ''byti''\n* ''Conditional'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the conditional of ''byti''\n* ''Future tense'': the future tense of ''byti'' + the infinitive\n* ''Imperative'': '''-\u00d8, -mo, -te''' after '''j''', or '''-i, -imo, -ite''' after another consonant.\n\nThe forms with '''-l-''' in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the ''L-participle''. The remaining participles are formed as follows:\n* ''Present active participle'': '''-\u0173\u0107i''' (first conjugation), '''-\u0119\u0107i''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Present passive participle'': '''-omy/-emy''' (first conjugation), '''-imy''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past active participle'': '''-v\u0161i''' after a vowel, or '''-\u0161i''' after a consonant\n* ''Past passive participle'': '''-ny''' after a vowel, '''-eny''' after a consonant. Monosyllabic verbs (except for those on '''-ati''') have '''-ty'''.

Often used are the following alternative forms:\n* In the first conjugation, '''-aje-''' is often reduced to '''-a-''': ''ty d\u011bla\u0161'', ''on d\u011bla'' etc.\n* Instead of the 1st person singular ending '''-(j)\u0173''', the ending '''-(e)m''' is sometimes used as well: ''ja d\u011blam'', ''ja hvalim'', ''ja nesem''.\n* Instead of '''-mo''' in the 1st person plural, '''-me''' can be used as well: ''my d\u011bla(je)me'', ''my hvalime''.\n* Instead of '''-hmo''' in the imperfect tense, '''-smo''' and the more archaic '''-hom''' can be used as well.\n* Instead of the conjugated forms of ''byti'' in the conditional (''byh, bys'' etc.), ''by'' is often used as a [[particle (grammar)|particle]]: ''ja by pisal(a)'', ''ty by pisal(a)'' etc.\n* Verbal nouns can have the ending '''-ije''' instead of '''-je''': ''d\u011blanije'', ''hvaljenije''.\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\nA few verbs have an irregular conjugation:\n* '''byti''' \"to be\" has ''jesm, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, s\u0173t'' in the present tense, ''b\u011bh, b\u011b\u0161e...'' in the imperfect tense, and ''b\u0173d\u0173, b\u0173de\u0161...'' in the future\n* '''dati''' \"to give\", '''j\u011bsti''' \"to eat\" and '''v\u011bd\u011bti''' \"to know\" have the following present tense: ''dam, da\u0161, da, damo, date, dad\u0173t''; ''jem, je\u0161...''; ''v\u011bm, v\u011b\u0161...''\n* '''idti''' \"to go by foot, to walk\" has an irregular L-participle: ''\u0161el, \u0161la, \u0161lo, \u0161li''.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nWords in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages. For this purpose, the latter are subdivided into six groups:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]\n* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]\n* [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]\n* [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croat]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]\n\nThese groups are treated equally. In some situations even smaller languages, like [[Kashubian language|Cashubian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Sorbian languages]] are included.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/voting_machine.html|title=Voting Machine|website=steen.free.fr|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Interslavic vocabulary has been compiled in such way that words are understandable to a maximum number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, but also on the inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]: to ensure coherence, a system of regular [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/design_criteria.html#vocabulary|title=Vocabulary|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=\"#000000\" CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=0 VALIGN=TOP STYLE=\"font-size:80%\"\n|+ <big>Sample words in Interslavic, compared to other Slavic languages</big>\n!

Along with this belief came also the need for a Slavic umbrella language. A strong candidate for that position was [[Russian language|Russian]], the language of the largest (and during most of the 19th century the only) Slavic state and also mother tongue of more than half of the Slavs. This option enjoyed most of its popularity in Russia itself, but was also favoured by Pan-Slavists abroad, for example the Slovak [[\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far]].<ref name=\"Ruposova\">\u041b.\u041f. \u0420\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430'', in: ''\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430'' (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442, 2012 no. 1, p. 55. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Others believed that [[Old Church Slavonic]] was a better and also more neutral solution. In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in [[Orthodox church|Orthodox]] liturgy, where it played a role similar to [[Latin]] in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, [[Proto-Slavic]]. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], its grammar was complex, and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.\n\n=== Early projects ===\nThe first Interslavic grammar, ''Gramat\u00ed\u010dno izk\u00e2zanje ob r\u00faskom jez\u00edku'' by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107]], was written in 1665.<ref>Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, ''\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0431 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0443''. Moscow, 1665.</ref> He referred to the language as '''Ruski''', but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic]] and his own [[Ikavian \u010cakavian]] dialect of [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Kri\u017eani\u0107 used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise ''Politika'' (1663\u20131666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in ''Politika'' are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=\u0418\u0417 \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0413\u0412\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418 \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0418|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKri\u017eani\u0107 was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], had translated the ''Summa Doctrinae Christanae'' by [[Petrus Canisius]] into \"Slovignsky\",<ref>Petrus Canisius, \"Svmma navka christianskoga / sloxena castnim v\u010ditegliem Petrom Kanisiem; tvmacena iz latinskoga jazika v slovignsky, i vtisstena po zapoviedi presuetoga Otca Pape Gregoria Trinaestoga [...] Koie iz Vlasskoga, illi Latinskoga iazika, v Slouignsky Jazik protuma\u010dio iest pop Ssimvn Bvdineo Zadranin\".

In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the [[South Slavic languages]] there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]], that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of [[Matija Majar]] (1809\u20131892), a Slovenian [[Austroslavism|Austroslavist]] who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published [[Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski]] (\"Mutual Slavic Orthography\").<ref name=\"majar\">Matija Majar-Ziljski, ''Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski, to je: Uzajemna Slovnica ali Mluvnica Slavjanska''. Prague, 1865.</ref> In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was by taking their own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic (\"mutual\") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of [[Cyril and Methodius]]<ref name=\"brata\">Matija Majar Ziljski, ''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga''. Prague, 1864.</ref> and for a magazine he published in the years 1873\u20131875, ''Slavjan''.

They deplored the fact that these dialects had diverged beyond mutual comprehensibility, and the Pan-Slavic language they envisioned was intended to reverse this process. Their long-term objective was that this language would replace the individual Slavic languages.<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{cite book |author=Anna-Maria Meyer |date=2014 |title=Wiederbelebung einer Utopie.

In most cases they provided grammatical comparisons between the Slavic languages, sometimes but not always offering solutions they labelled as \"Pan-Slavic\". What their projects have in common that they neither have a rigidly prescriptive grammar, nor a separate vocabulary.\n\n=== The twentieth century ===\n[[File:Bohumil Holy.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Bohumil Hol\u00fd]]<br />(1885\u20131947)]]\nIn the early 20th century it had become clear that the divergence of the Slavic languages was irreversible and the concept of a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like [[Esperanto]], efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.<ref name=\"Meyer\" />{{RP|118}}\n\nIn the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands. In 1907 the Czech dialectologist [[Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek]] (1852\u20131919) published a grammar of '''Neuslavisch''', a proposal for a common literary language for all Slavs within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]].<ref>Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek, ''Grammatik der Neuslawischen Sprache''.

For that reason it gained little acceptance among Slavs: a high degree of simplification, characteristic for most international auxiliary languages, makes it easier to learn for non-Slavs, but widens the distance with the natural Slavic languages and gives the language an overly artificial character, which by many is considered a disadvantage.<ref name=\"narodna pravda\">{{cite web|url=http://narodna.pravda.com.ua/discussions/4a8f1e1b731fc/|script-title=uk:\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0428\u0442\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u041c\u043e\u0432\u0438: \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0432\u0430|publisher=Narodna.pravda.com.ua|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=uk}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, the '''Slovianski''' project was started by a group of people from different countries, who felt the need for a simple and neutral Slavic language that the Slavs could understand without prior learning.

[[Noun]]s can have three [[gender (grammar)|genders]], two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative]]). Since several Slavic languages also have a [[vocative]], it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThere is no [[article (grammar)|article]]. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five [[declension]]s:\n* masculine nouns (ending in a \u2013 usually hard \u2013 [[consonant]]): ''dom'' \"house\", ''m\u0173\u017e'' \"man\"\n* feminine nouns ending in '''-a''': ''\u017eena'' \"woman\", ''zemja'' \"earth\"\n* feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant: ''kos\u0165'' \"bone\"\n* neuter nouns ending in '''-o''' or '''-e''': ''slovo'' \"word\", ''morje'' \"sea\"\n* Old Church Slavonic also had a consonantal declension that in most Slavic languages merged into the remaining declensions. Some Interslavic projects and writers preserve this declension, which consists of nouns of all three genders, mostly neuters:\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-m\u0119/-men-''': ''im\u0119/imene'' \"name\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-\u0119/-\u0119t-''' (children and young animals): ''tel\u0119/tel\u0119te'' \"calf\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-o/-es-''': ''nebo/nebese'' \"heaven\"\n** masculine nouns of the group '''-en-''': ''kame\u0144/kamene'' \"stone\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-\u00f2v''': ''c\u0155k\u00f2v/c\u0155kve'' \"church\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-i/-er-''': ''mati/matere'' \"mother\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Declension of nouns'''\n! rowspan=\"3\" |&nbsp;!! colspan=\"4\" | masculine !! colspan=\"2\" | neuter !! colspan=\"3\" | feminine !! colspan=\"3\" | consonantal\n|-\n! hard, animate !! hard, non-animate !! soft, animate !! soft, non-animate !! hard !! soft !! -a, hard !! -a, soft !! -\u00d8 !! m. !! n. !! f.\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | singular\n|-\n!

A [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.\n\nVerbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:<br />\n''d\u011blati ~ sd\u011blati'' \"to do\"<br />\n''\u010distiti ~ iz\u010distiti'' \"to clean\"<br />\n''pisati ~ napisati'' \"to write\"<br />\nBecause prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:\n* '''-ati''' becomes '''-yvati''' (e.g. ''zapisati ~ zapisyvati'' \"to note, to register, to record\", ''dokazati ~ dokazyvati'' \"to prove\")\n* '''-iti''' become '''-jati''' (e.g. ''napraviti ~ napravjati'' \"to lead\", ''pozvoliti ~ pozvaljati'' \"to allow\", ''oprostiti ~ opra\u0161\u0107ati'' \"to simplify\")\n\nSome aspect pairs are irregular, for example ''nazvati ~ nazyvati'' \"to name, to call\", ''prijdti ~ prihoditi'' \"to come\", ''podj\u0119ti ~ podimati'' \"to undertake\".\n\n==== Stems ====\nThe Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. To simplify these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal [[stem (linguistics)|stems]]. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:\n* the first stem is used for the [[infinitive]], the [[past tense]], the [[conditional mood]], the [[past passive participle]] and the [[verbal noun]]. It is formed by removing the ending '''-ti''' from the infinitive: ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011bla-'', ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''prosi-'', ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-''. Verbs ending in '''-sti''' can also have their stem ending on '''t''' or '''d''', f.ex. ''vesti > ved-'' \"to lead\", ''gnesti > gnet-'' \"to crush\".\n* the second stem is used for the [[present tense]], the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[present active participle]]. In most cases both stems are identical, and in most of the remaining cases the second stem can be derived regularly from the first. In particular cases they have to be learned separately. In the present tense, a distinction is made between two conjugations:\n** the first conjugation includes almost all verbs that do not have the ending '''-iti''', as well as monosyllabic verbs on '''-iti''':\n*** verbs on '''-ati''' have the stem '''-aj-''': ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011blaj-''\n*** verbs on '''-ovati''' have the stem '''-uj-''': ''kovati'' \"to forge\" > ''kuj-''\n*** verbs on '''-n\u0173ti''' have the stem '''-n-''': ''t\u0119gn\u0173ti'' \"to pull, to draw\" > ''t\u0119gn-''\n*** monosyllabic verbs have '''-j-''': ''piti'' \"to drink\" > ''pij-'', ''\u010duti'' \"to feel\" > ''\u010duj-''\n*** the second stem is identical to the first stem if the latter ends in a consonant: ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-'', ''vesti'' \"to lead\" > ''ved-''\n** the second conjugation includes all polysyllabic verbs on '''-iti''' and most verbs on '''-\u011bti''': ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''pros-i-'', ''vid\u011bti'' \"to see\" > ''vid-i-''\nThere are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: ''pisati'' \"to write\" > ''pi\u0161-'', ''spati'' \"to sleep\" > ''sp-i-'', ''zvati'' \"to call\" > ''zov-'', ''ht\u011bti'' \"to want\" > ''ho\u0107-''. In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.\n\n==== Conjugation ====\nThe various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:\n* ''Present tense'': '''-\u0173, -e\u0161, -e, -emo, -ete, -\u0173t''' (first conjugation); '''-j\u0173, -i\u0161, -i, -imo, -ite, -\u0119t''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past tense \u2013 simple'' (as in Russian): m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li'''\n* ''Past tense \u2013 complex'' (as in South Slavic):\n** ''Imperfect tense'': '''-h, -\u0161e, -\u0161e, -hmo, -ste, -h\u0173'''\n** ''Perfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the present tense of ''byti'' \"to be\"\n** ''Pluperfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the imperfect tense of ''byti''\n* ''Conditional'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the conditional of ''byti''\n* ''Future tense'': the future tense of ''byti'' + the infinitive\n* ''Imperative'': '''-\u00d8, -mo, -te''' after '''j''', or '''-i, -imo, -ite''' after another consonant.\n\nThe forms with '''-l-''' in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the ''L-participle''. The remaining participles are formed as follows:\n* ''Present active participle'': '''-\u0173\u0107i''' (first conjugation), '''-\u0119\u0107i''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Present passive participle'': '''-omy/-emy''' (first conjugation), '''-imy''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past active participle'': '''-v\u0161i''' after a vowel, or '''-\u0161i''' after a consonant\n* ''Past passive participle'': '''-ny''' after a vowel, '''-eny''' after a consonant. Monosyllabic verbs (except for those on '''-ati''') have '''-ty'''.

Often used are the following alternative forms:\n* In the first conjugation, '''-aje-''' is often reduced to '''-a-''': ''ty d\u011bla\u0161'', ''on d\u011bla'' etc.\n* Instead of the 1st person singular ending '''-(j)\u0173''', the ending '''-(e)m''' is sometimes used as well: ''ja d\u011blam'', ''ja hvalim'', ''ja nesem''.\n* Instead of '''-mo''' in the 1st person plural, '''-me''' can be used as well: ''my d\u011bla(je)me'', ''my hvalime''.\n* Instead of '''-hmo''' in the imperfect tense, '''-smo''' and the more archaic '''-hom''' can be used as well.\n* Instead of the conjugated forms of ''byti'' in the conditional (''byh, bys'' etc.), ''by'' is often used as a [[particle (grammar)|particle]]: ''ja by pisal(a)'', ''ty by pisal(a)'' etc.\n* Verbal nouns can have the ending '''-ije''' instead of '''-je''': ''d\u011blanije'', ''hvaljenije''.\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\nA few verbs have an irregular conjugation:\n* '''byti''' \"to be\" has ''jesm, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, s\u0173t'' in the present tense, ''b\u011bh, b\u011b\u0161e...'' in the imperfect tense, and ''b\u0173d\u0173, b\u0173de\u0161...'' in the future\n* '''dati''' \"to give\", '''j\u011bsti''' \"to eat\" and '''v\u011bd\u011bti''' \"to know\" have the following present tense: ''dam, da\u0161, da, damo, date, dad\u0173t''; ''jem, je\u0161...''; ''v\u011bm, v\u011b\u0161...''\n* '''idti''' \"to go by foot, to walk\" has an irregular L-participle: ''\u0161el, \u0161la, \u0161lo, \u0161li''.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nWords in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages. For this purpose, the latter are subdivided into six groups:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]\n* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]\n* [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]\n* [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croat]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]\n\nThese groups are treated equally. In some situations even smaller languages, like [[Kashubian language|Cashubian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Sorbian languages]] are included.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/voting_machine.html|title=Voting Machine|website=steen.free.fr|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Interslavic vocabulary has been compiled in such way that words are understandable to a maximum number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, but also on the inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]: to ensure coherence, a system of regular [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/design_criteria.html#vocabulary|title=Vocabulary|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=\"#000000\" CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=0 VALIGN=TOP STYLE=\"font-size:80%\"\n|+ <big>Sample words in Interslavic, compared to other Slavic languages</big>\n!

In 1999 she was cast in the campus drama ''School 2'' as a rebellious high school girl, which launched her to stardom. She became a popular young star at barely 20 years old, appearing in [[Korean drama|TV dramas]] and movies. However, a string of poor acting performances brought her negative criticism. Critics and viewers disparagingly called her an \"attractive but blank actress,\" more famous for being a fashion icon and actor [[Lee Jung-jae]]'s then-girlfriend.<ref name=miri />\n\nIn 2006, after reading the synopsis of TV series ''[[Goodbye Solo (TV series)|Goodbye Solo]]'', Kim knew that she wanted the role of Mi-ri more than anything, saying \"I was ready to do anything to play her.\" She begged renowned screenwriter [[Noh Hee-kyung]] to cast her, and though Noh turned her down five times, Kim would not give up, and her determination eventually convinced Noh to see her hidden potential. Vowing to start over from the bottom, Kim went through strict acting training which included basic vocal and respiratory exercises; she got a hold of the script before anyone else, and continued to analyze the role and practice every day. Kim said that until ''Goodbye Solo'', she hadn't been sure what to do with the rest of her life, but the drama made her feel that acting was her true calling, like she'd \"finally opened up the first page of the textbook.\" She received good reviews for her performance, and despite the drama's low ratings, the role transformed her career.<ref name=miri>Shin, Hae-in (16 March 2006).

In 1999 she was cast in the campus drama ''School 2'' as a rebellious high school girl, which launched her to stardom. She became a popular young star at barely 20 years old, appearing in [[Korean drama|TV dramas]] and movies. However, a string of poor acting performances brought her negative criticism. Critics and viewers disparagingly called her an \"attractive but blank actress,\" more famous for being a fashion icon and actor [[Lee Jung-jae]]'s then-girlfriend.<ref name=miri />\n\nIn 2006, after reading the synopsis of TV series ''[[Goodbye Solo (TV series)|Goodbye Solo]]'', Kim knew that she wanted the role of Mi-ri more than anything, saying \"I was ready to do anything to play her.\" She begged renowned screenwriter [[Noh Hee-kyung]] to cast her, and though Noh turned her down five times, Kim would not give up, and her determination eventually convinced Noh to see her hidden potential. Vowing to start over from the bottom, Kim went through strict acting training which included basic vocal and respiratory exercises; she got a hold of the script before anyone else, and continued to analyze the role and practice every day. Kim said that until ''Goodbye Solo'', she hadn't been sure what to do with the rest of her life, but the drama made her feel that acting was her true calling, like she'd \"finally opened up the first page of the textbook.\" She received good reviews for her performance, and despite the drama's low ratings, the role transformed her career.<ref name=miri>Shin, Hae-in (16 March 2006).

She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"]. ''Time Magazine'', April 3, 1939</ref> One critic said Cornell played every queen as though she were a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as though she were a queen.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1982, with friend [[Lady Bird Johnson]], she founded the National Wildflower Research Center, now the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]], in [[Austin, Texas]]. The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor. She has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Hayes is also in the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html#H|title=Members of the American Theater Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHayes was a Catholic<ref>Hayes, Helen.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier. Hayes was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack.<ref name=pace>Pace, Eric.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF123DF93BA25750C0A965958260 \"Helen Hayes, Flower of the Stage, Dies at 92\"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 18, 1993</ref> In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.<ref>[http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes Postage Stamp\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611152808/https://beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes |date=2011-06-11 }} beyondtheperf.com, April 25, 2011, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDiminutive and homespun, Helen Hayes was distinctly less glamorous than the other Great Ladies, but the qualities of modesty and practicality that she projected helped create her lasting appeal.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\".

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

It defines the rights and obligations of the citizens of [[Catalonia]], the political institutions of the Catalan community, their competences and relations with the rest of [[Spain]], and the financing of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Government of Catalonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.gencat.cat/ca/inici/ |title=Official web of the Generalitat de Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |date=18 June 2006 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis Law was approved by [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 18 June 2006 and supplanted the first [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|Statute of Sau]], which dated from 1979. The approval was given by the 36% of Catalan people with the right to vote.

Nosaltres decidim'' (in English, \"We are a nation. We decide\").\n\n==History==\nIn 1919, a first [[Statute of Catalonia of 1919|project of Statute]] was started by the [[Commonwealth of Catalonia]] although it was rejected by Spanish ''[[Cortes Generales]]''.\n\nIn 1928, a [[Draft Constitution of the Catalan Republic of 1928|project of Constitution]] was written in [[Havana]] by exiled Catalan nationalists.\n\nCatalonia first obtained a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932|Statute of Autonomy in 1932]], during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. This law was abolished by General [[Francisco Franco]] after the [[Spanish Civil War]], largely because Catalonia had been a region generally opposed to Franco's ''Nacionales'' forces. During periods of his rule, public usage of the Catalan language and culture, and more specifically, Catalan self-government were harshly suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1979, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|second Statute]] was approved by referendum.\n\nOn 18 June 2006, a [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|referendum]] amending the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]] to further expand the authority of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Catalonia's government, was approved, and became effective on 9 August 2006.\n\nThis referendum was noted for its [[voter turnout]] being below 50%.\nIt was also noted for its uneasy coalition forging. Tensions within the coalition government which originally promoted the Statute led to an [[2006 Catalan Parliament election|early regional election in 2006]].\n\n===2005 Draft===\nThe \"Draft of New Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia of 2005\" was a [[reform]] proposal regarding Catalan self-government.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the [[Catalan Parliament]] approved (with the support of 120 [[Member of Parliament|deputies]] to 15) a proposal for reform of the current [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The approved proposal was sent for review and discussion to the [[Cortes Generales]] (Spain's parliament) on 2 November 2005.\n\nAfter receiving the proposal drafted by the Catalan regional parliament, on 2 November 2005 the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Spanish Congress of Deputies]] approved the admission to formality of the ''Proposal for reform of the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia'' with the support of all the groups except the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party (PP)]]. The latter filed an objection of unconstitutionality before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]], which ruled unconstitutional 14 articles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/jurisprudencia/paginas/Sentencia.aspx?cod=16273|title=Detalle de sentencia|work=tribunalconstitucional.es|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204071339/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/jurisprudencia/Paginas/Sentencia.aspx?cod=16273|archive-date=4 December 2012|df=}}</ref> of the original text. Its [[constitutionality]] has also been contested by some intellectuals and [[journalist]]s related to liberal or conservative media such as the [[COPE (radio station)|COPE (Catholic radio network)]] and the Madrid-based [[newspaper]]s ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' and ''[[La Raz\u00f3n (Madrid)|La Raz\u00f3n]]''.\n\nOn 21 January 2006, [[Spanish Prime Minister]] [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] and Catalan [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Artur Mas]] arrived at a pre-agreement about nation definition and financing in the current project of statute.\n\nOn 10 May 2006, the amended text<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060725070939/http://www.gencat.net/nouestatut/cat/estatut_textsenat_cat.pdf]</ref> passed through its final reading through both Houses of the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]], with the support of all parties except both the Spanish main opposition party, the conservative People's Party, and the [[Catalan separatism|Catalan separatist]] party [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]. The latter voted against the project in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Spanish Congress of Deputies]] but abstained in the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (to avoid a blocking vote). ERC voted against it, despite its senior members having had a hand in drafting its content, as a result of the internal tensions within the party which this issue had brought to the surface. Later on both parties, for opposite reasons, supported a ''no'' vote in the [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|referendum held afterwards regarding the passing of the new Statute]].\n\nThe [[List of Presidents of Catalonia|president of Catalonia]], [[Pasqual Maragall]], decided that Sunday 18 June would be the date on which the text would be put to the [[Catalan people]] in the form of a [[referendum]]. The referendum approved the Statute, the \"yes\" side receiving 74% of [[votes]] cast. The [[voter turnout]] was 49.41% of the total [[constituency|electorate]], an unprecedentedly low figure for this type of vote. The new Statute has been in force since 9 August 2006.\n\n===Data===\n* The [[1931 Catalan autonomy referendum|1931 referendum]] on the Statute of Autonomy registered a [[voter turnout]] of 75.13%, of which 99.49% voted favourably to its passing, according to the official results released.\n* The [[1979 Catalan autonomy referendum|1979 referendum]] on the Statute of Autonomy registered a voter turnout of 59.7%, of which 88.1% voted favorably.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paco Soto/Barcelona |url=http://www.hoy.es/pg060619/prensa/noticias/Nacional/200606/19/HOY-NAC-092.html |title=Hoy Digital &#124; NACIONAL&nbsp;\u2013 El nuevo Estatut catal\u00e1n cosecha el menor respaldo de la historia |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref>\n* The [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|2006 referendum]] on the current version of the Statute registered a voter turnout of 48.85%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/132031/0/estatut/referendum/reacciones/ |title=Reacciones pol\u00edticas al \"S\u00ed\" de los catalanes al Estatut empa\u00f1ado por el bajo \u00edndice de participaci\u00f3n |publisher=20minutos.es |date=18 June 2006 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref> Of the total votes, 73.24% were in favour of the new Statute, while 20.57% were against.\n\n==Self-government under the statute==\nCatalonia is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] within the Kingdom of [[Spain]], with the status of [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|historical region]] in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. In September 2005, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] approved the definition of Catalonia as a 'nation' in the [[preamble]]<ref>[http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/preambul.htm Preamble of the ''Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708213233/http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/preambul.htm |date=8 July 2008}}, Generalitat of Catalonia</ref> of the new Statute of Autonomy (autonomous basic law).\n\nThe 120 delegates of all parties (CiU, PSC, ERC, ICV-EA) with the exception of the 15 delegates of the Partido Popular approved this definition.\nIn the opinion of the Spanish Government this has a 'declaratory' but not a 'legal' value, since the Spanish Constitution recognises the indissoluble \"unity of the Spanish Nation\".\n\nThe [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] is the institution in which the self-government of Catalonia is politically organised. It consists of the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]], the [[President of the Generalitat de Catalunya|President of the Generalitat]], and the Executive Council or [[Government of Catalonia]].\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy gives the Generalitat of Catalonia the powers that enable it to carry out the functions of self-government.

The [[Occitan language]] ([[Aranese dialect|Aranese]] in [[Val d'Aran]]) is declared an official language of Catalonia, as Catalan and Spanish were since the 1979 Statute.\n* Creation of an entire title (Title I) dedicated to the rights and obligations of Catalan citizens, apart from the ones of the Spanish Constitution.\n* Creation of [[Vegueries]] as the new territorial division of Catalonia, suppression of the four Spanish Provincial Deputations.\n* Reinforce of the powers of the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]].

This law was abolished by General [[Francisco Franco]] after the [[Spanish Civil War]], largely because Catalonia had been a region generally opposed to Franco's ''Nacionales'' forces. During periods of his rule, public usage of the Catalan language and culture, and more specifically, Catalan self-government were harshly suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1979, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|second Statute]] was approved by referendum.\n\nOn 18 June 2006, a [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|referendum]] amending the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]] to further expand the authority of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Catalonia's government, was approved, and became effective on 9 August 2006.\n\nThis referendum was noted for its [[voter turnout]] being below 50%.\nIt was also noted for its uneasy coalition forging. Tensions within the coalition government which originally promoted the Statute led to an [[2006 Catalan Parliament election|early regional election in 2006]].\n\n===2005 Draft===\nThe \"Draft of New Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia of 2005\" was a [[reform]] proposal regarding Catalan self-government.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the [[Catalan Parliament]] approved (with the support of 120 [[Member of Parliament|deputies]] to 15) a proposal for reform of the current [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The approved proposal was sent for review and discussion to the [[Cortes Generales]] (Spain's parliament) on 2 November 2005.\n\nAfter receiving the proposal drafted by the Catalan regional parliament, on 2 November 2005 the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Spanish Congress of Deputies]] approved the admission to formality of the ''Proposal for reform of the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia'' with the support of all the groups except the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party (PP)]].

Its [[constitutionality]] has also been contested by some intellectuals and [[journalist]]s related to liberal or conservative media such as the [[COPE (radio station)|COPE (Catholic radio network)]] and the Madrid-based [[newspaper]]s ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' and ''[[La Raz\u00f3n (Madrid)|La Raz\u00f3n]]''.\n\nOn 21 January 2006, [[Spanish Prime Minister]] [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] and Catalan [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Artur Mas]] arrived at a pre-agreement about nation definition and financing in the current project of statute.\n\nOn 10 May 2006, the amended text<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060725070939/http://www.gencat.net/nouestatut/cat/estatut_textsenat_cat.pdf]</ref> passed through its final reading through both Houses of the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]], with the support of all parties except both the Spanish main opposition party, the conservative People's Party, and the [[Catalan separatism|Catalan separatist]] party [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]. The latter voted against the project in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Spanish Congress of Deputies]] but abstained in the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (to avoid a blocking vote). ERC voted against it, despite its senior members having had a hand in drafting its content, as a result of the internal tensions within the party which this issue had brought to the surface. Later on both parties, for opposite reasons, supported a ''no'' vote in the [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|referendum held afterwards regarding the passing of the new Statute]].\n\nThe [[List of Presidents of Catalonia|president of Catalonia]], [[Pasqual Maragall]], decided that Sunday 18 June would be the date on which the text would be put to the [[Catalan people]] in the form of a [[referendum]]. The referendum approved the Statute, the \"yes\" side receiving 74% of [[votes]] cast. The [[voter turnout]] was 49.41% of the total [[constituency|electorate]], an unprecedentedly low figure for this type of vote. The new Statute has been in force since 9 August 2006.\n\n===Data===\n* The [[1931 Catalan autonomy referendum|1931 referendum]] on the Statute of Autonomy registered a [[voter turnout]] of 75.13%, of which 99.49% voted favourably to its passing, according to the official results released.\n* The [[1979 Catalan autonomy referendum|1979 referendum]] on the Statute of Autonomy registered a voter turnout of 59.7%, of which 88.1% voted favorably.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paco Soto/Barcelona |url=http://www.hoy.es/pg060619/prensa/noticias/Nacional/200606/19/HOY-NAC-092.html |title=Hoy Digital &#124; NACIONAL&nbsp;\u2013 El nuevo Estatut catal\u00e1n cosecha el menor respaldo de la historia |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref>\n* The [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|2006 referendum]] on the current version of the Statute registered a voter turnout of 48.85%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/132031/0/estatut/referendum/reacciones/ |title=Reacciones pol\u00edticas al \"S\u00ed\" de los catalanes al Estatut empa\u00f1ado por el bajo \u00edndice de participaci\u00f3n |publisher=20minutos.es |date=18 June 2006 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref> Of the total votes, 73.24% were in favour of the new Statute, while 20.57% were against.\n\n==Self-government under the statute==\nCatalonia is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] within the Kingdom of [[Spain]], with the status of [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|historical region]] in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].
