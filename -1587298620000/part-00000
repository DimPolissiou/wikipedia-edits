He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked [[vigilante]] who defends the [[commoner]]s and [[indigenous peoples of California]] against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black [[costume]] includes a cape, a hat known as a [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]], and a mask covering the upper half of his face.\n\nIn the stories, Zorro has a high [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Zorro is an [[acrobat]] and an expert in various weapons, but the one he employs most frequently is his [[rapier]], which he uses often to carve the initial \"Z\" on his defeated foes, and other objects. He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].\n\nZorro is the [[secret identity]] of '''Don Diego de la Vega''' (originally ''Don Diego Vega''), a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega (originally ''Don Alejandro Vega''), the richest landowner in California, while Diego's mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in [[Spain]], and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge ''[[hacienda]]'', which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels, leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro's operations and as Tornado's hiding place. In order to divert suspicion about his identity, Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a [[fop]].\n\nZorro made his debut in the 1919 novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', originally meant as a stand-alone story. However, the success of the 1920 film adaptation ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades: the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories, the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959, the year after his death. ''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]]. While the rest of McCulley's Zorro stories did not enjoy the same popularity, as most of them were never reprinted until the 21st century, the character also appears in over 40 films and in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957\u201359, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]. Other media featuring Zorro include stories by other authors, audio/radio dramas, comic books and strips, stage productions and video games.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books, with [[Batman]] drawing particularly close parallels to the character.\n\n== Publishing history ==\n[[File:Capistrano2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zorro's debut in the novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'' (1919).]]\nZorro debuted in [[Johnston McCulley]]'s novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', serialized in five parts between August 9 and September 6, 1919 in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=lat>{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Zorro still makes his mark|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/28/entertainment/et-zorro28|accessdate=October 18, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 2005}}</ref> The story was originally meant as a standalone tale, and at the [[denouement]], Zorro's true identity is revealed to all.\n\n[[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], on their [[honeymoon]], selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, [[United Artists]], beginning the character's cinematic tradition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The novel was adapted as the film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which Fairbanks produced, co-wrote and starred in as Diego/Zorro. The movie was a commercial success,<ref name=lat /> and the 1924 reprint of McCulley's story by publisher [[Grosset & Dunlap]] used the same title, capitalizing on the movie's popularity. The novel has since been reprinted using both titles.\n\nIn response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922. The 1922 story was ''The Further Adventures of Zorro'' and was also serialized in ''Argosy All-Story Weekly''. Fairbanks picked up the movie rights for the sequel that year. However, Fairbanks's sequel, ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925), was more based on the 1919 novel ''Don Q's Love Story'' by the mother-son duo Kate Prichard and [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] than ''The Further Adventures''. Thus McCulley received no credit on the film.<ref name=ths>{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Stuart|title=The Hollywood Sequel: History & Form, 1911\u20132010|date=2014|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=978-1-84457-843-6|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtYtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=The+Further+Adventures+of+Zorro+(1922)&source=bl&ots=TayFQci5_O&sig=t3lBdIeEx3syvLEVBUM7BA9jH0I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8xIOAgPvWAhWhz4MKHddhCBw4ChDoAQhNMAc#v=onepage&q=The%20Further%20Adventures%20of%20Zorro%20(1922)&f=false|accessdate=October 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt first, production of new Zorro stories proceeded at irregular intervals: the third novel, ''Zorro Rides Again'' (not to be confused with the 1937 theatrical serial) was published in 1931, nine years after the second one. Then, between 1932 and 1941, McCulley wrote four short stories and two serialized novels. Zorro stories were published much more frequently between 1944 and 1951, a period in which McCulley published 52 short stories with the character for the ''West Magazine''. \"Zorro Rides the Trail!\", which appeared in ''Max Brand's Western Magazine'' in 1954, is the last story to be published during the author's lifetime, and the second-to-last story overall. The last, \"The Mask of Zorro\" (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in ''Short Stories for Men'' in 1959. These stories [[Retroactive continuity|ignore]] Zorro's public revelation of his identity.\n\n''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]]. For the most part, McCulley's other Zorro stories remained overlooked and out-of-print until the 21st century. [http://www.boldventurepress.com Bold Venture Press] collected all McCulley's Zorro stories ''Zorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures'', in six volumes.\n\nOver 40 Zorro titled films were made over the years, including ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', the 1940 classic starring [[Tyrone Power]]. The character was also featured in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957\u2013'59, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]].<ref name=lat /> Zorro appears in several stories written by other authors, comics books and strips, stage productions, video games and other media. McCulley died in 1958, just as Zorro was at the height of his popularity thanks to the Disney series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:The Mark of Zorro (1920) - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the first Zorro film, ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which was instrumental in the early success of the character]]\n\nIn ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]],'' Se\u00f1or Zorro became an outlaw in the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|pueblo of Los Angeles]] in [[California]] \"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed\" and is dubbed the \"Curse of Capistrano\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless [[fop]], she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Do\u00f1a Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (''caballeros'') who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.\n\nIn later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.\n\nIn McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.\n\nSeveral Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.\n\nMcCulley's stories are set during the era of [[History of California#Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)|Spanish California]] (1769\u20131821)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Zorro.htm|title=The Legacy of the Fox:A Chronology of Zorro | publisher=|date= |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref> and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of [[History of California#Mexican period (1821 to 1846)|Mexican California]] (1821\u20131848).\n\n==Character motifs==\n[[File:Zorroandbernardo.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]) and Bernardo ([[Gene Sheldon]]) in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1957\u20131959 ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series]]\n\nThe character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cape or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]], and a black sackcloth [[mask]] that covers the top half of his head. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and in the television series ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957\u20131959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro's mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded [[domino mask]], which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro's cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a \"wide sombrero,\" and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nHis favored weapon is a [[rapier]], which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects. He also uses other weapons, including a [[bullwhip]] and a [[pistol]].\n\nThe [[fox]] is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics \"Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free {{nbsp}}...\" from [[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Disney's television series]] theme.\n\nHis heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.\n\n==Skills and resources==\n[[File:Zorroridesagain.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serial ''[[Zorro Rides Again]]'' (1937), starring [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as a descendant of the original Zorro]]\nZorro is an agile athlete and [[acrobat]], using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents.\n\nHis calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled him to use his two main weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent.\n\nIn some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro's boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat.\n\nZorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In ''The Curse of Capistrano'', it was unnamed. In Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series the horse gets the name [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his ''[[hacienda]]'' with a system of secret passages and tunnels.\n\nMcCulley's concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939), starring [[Reed Hadley]] as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks' version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley's stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney's ''Zorro'' television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro's secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master's charade. [[The CBN Family Channel|The Family Channel]]'s ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by [[Juan Diego Botto]], with a similar disability and pretense.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Zorro gip.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Reed Hadley]]) in the serial ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939)]]\n\nIn ''The Curse of Capistrano'', Diego is described as \"a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years, noted the length of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] for his small interest in the really important things of life.\" It is also said that \"Don Diego was unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times. It appeared that he disliked action. He seldom wore his blade, except as a matter of style and apparel. He was damnably polite to all women and paid court to none. ... Those who knew Don Diego best declared he yawned ten score times a day\". Though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. At the end of the novel, Diego explains that he has planned his double identity since he was fifteen:\n\n<blockquote>\"It began ten years ago, when I was but a lad of fifteen,\" he said. \"I heard tales of persecution. I saw my friends, the frailes, annoyed and robbed. I saw soldiers beat an old native who was my friend. And then I determined to play this game.\"\n\n\"It would be a difficult game to play, I knew. So I pretended to have small interest in life, so that men never would connect my name with that of the highwayman I expected to become. In secret, I practiced horsemanship and learned how to handle a blade\u2014\"\n\n\"By the saints, he did,\" Sergeant Gonzales growled.\n\n\"One half of me was the languid Don Diego you all knew, and the other half was the Curse of Capistrano I hoped one day to be. And then the time came, and my work began.\"\n\n\"It is a peculiar thing to explain, se\u00f1ores. The moment I donned cloak and mask, the Don Diego part of me fell away. My body straightened, new blood seemed to course through my veins, my voice grew strong and firm, fire came to me! And the moment I removed cloak and mask I was the languid Don Diego again. Is it not a peculiar thing?</blockquote>\n\nThis part of the backstory was changed in the 1920 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'': Diego is recently returned from [[Spain]] at the start of the movie, and Zorro later tells Lolita that he learnt his swordsmanship in Spain. The 1925 sequel ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' expands on this concept by saying that \"Though the home of the De Vegas has long been on California soil, the eldest son of each new generation returns to Spain for a period of travel and study.\" The 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' keeps the idea of Diego learning his swordsmanship in Spain, and adds the idea of him being unexpectedly summoned home by his father Don Alejandro when California fell into the hand of an oppressing dictator. Both ideas would then be included in most retelling of the character's backstory.\n\nMcCulley's portrayal of Diego's personality, with minor variations, is followed in most Zorro media.\n\nA notable exception to this portrayal is Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957\u201359), where Diego, despite using the original fa\u00e7ade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and simply masquerades as \"the most inept swordsman in all of California.\" In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does, but thinks he does not have the skill.\n\nThe Family Channel's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1990\u20131993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade is actually exaggerating his real interests. Diego is actually well-versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and to have no interest in swordplay or action. Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave in this version of the story.\n\n==Inspirations==\nThe historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is [[Joaquin Murrieta]], whose life was fictionalized in an 1854 [[dime novel]] by [[John Rollin Ridge]]. In the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' Murrieta's (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' [[pulp magazine|pulp series]] by [[Emma Orczy]].\n\nThe character recalls other figures, such as [[Robin Hood]], [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]], [[Salomon Pico]],<ref>Magill, Frank N. \"Magill's Survey of Cinema: Silent Films\". Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, 1982. and Tompkins, Walker. Decade of the Desperado. Santa Barbara Magazine Vol. 8 No. 4, Santa Barbara. 1982.</ref> [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza]], and [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]. Another possible historical inspiration is [[William Lamport]], an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by [[Vicente Riva Palacio]]; ''The Irish Zorro'' (2004) is a recent biography. Another is [[Estanislao]], a [[Yokuts]] man who led a revolt against the [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jose]] in 1827.\n\nThe 1890s [[penny dreadful]] treatment of the [[Spring-heeled Jack]] character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro's heroic persona. Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked [[alter ego]] to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter \"S\" into walls with his rapier as a calling card.\n\nLike Sir Percy in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete [[dandy]] who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character [[The Masked Rider (1919 film)|''The Masked Rider'']] (1919).

The main character is played by [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Robert Livingston]], who would then play the actual Zorro in the movie ''[[The Bold Caballero]]'', also released in 1936.\n\n[[The Masked Rider]], the primary [[mascot]] of [[Texas Tech University]], is similar to Zorro. Originally called \"Ghost Rider\", it was an unofficial mascot appearing in a few games in 1936 and then became the official mascot with the 1954 Gator Bowl.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books. [[Bob Kane]] has credited Zorro as part of the inspiration for the character [[Batman]], which was created in 1939.<ref>Boichel, Bill. \"Batman: Commodity as Myth.\" The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Like Don Diego de la Vega, Bruce Wayne is [[affluent]], the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish and uncaring to throw off suspicion. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s comic book miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' (2001\u20132002) both include multiple Zorro references like the Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman's origins, Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', starring [[Tyrone Power]].\n\nZorro inspired a similar pulp character known as [[El Coyote (fictional character)|El Coyote]], which was created in 1943 by Jos\u00e9 Mallorqu\u00ed. A sample superhero character called The Fox appearing in the ''[[GURPS Supers|Supers]]'' supplement of the [[GURPS|GURPS role-playing system]] is also based on Zorro.\n\nThe 1954 ''[[Man with the Steel Whip]]'' [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serial features a masked hero similar to Zorro, called El Latigo. Republic had previously released five Zorro serials between 1937 and 1949, but had since lost the licence for the character and could not use him anymore. The serial makes frequent use of [[stock footage]] from all five Zorro serials, with scenes originally showing Zorro now being interpreted as showing El Latigo: the result of this is that the costume and body shape of El Latigo keeps changing between scenes, even becoming female in scenes taken from ''[[Zorro's Black Whip]]'' (1944).<ref name=\"GMS\">{{cite book | last = Harmon| first = Jim |author2=[[Donald F.

Hanna-Barbera Production's animated series ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' (1959\u20131962) features El Kabong, an alternate persona of the main character [[Quick Draw McGraw]], which is loosely based upon Zorro.\n\nIn the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001\u20132004), a DC Comics character, [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], bears a striking similarity to Zorro, in that he wears the same style hat, mask, sash and cape. The main difference is that his primary weapon is a whip. The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004\u20132006), voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro's appearance were added in. Seen in the episode \"[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]\" (2005), he appears alongside [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[Bat Lash]] and [[Jonah Hex]].\n\nIn 2015, The M7 Con Western Convention, held at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] featured a segment on the history of Zorro in film and television. The presentation focused on the great Zorro actors including [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], and [[Duncan Regehr]]. Maestro Ramon Martinez and actor [[Alex Kruz]] gave a live demonstration of the [[Spain|Spanish]] style of fencing known as La Verdadera [[Destreza]].

He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked [[vigilante]] who defends the [[commoner]]s and [[indigenous peoples of California]] against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black [[costume]] includes a cape, a hat known as a [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]], and a mask covering the upper half of his face.\n\nIn the stories, Zorro has a high [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Zorro is an [[acrobat]] and an expert in various weapons, but the one he employs most frequently is his [[rapier]], which he uses often to carve the initial \"Z\" on his defeated foes, and other objects. He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].\n\nZorro is the [[secret identity]] of '''Don Diego de la Vega''' (originally ''Don Diego Vega''), a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega (originally ''Don Alejandro Vega''), the richest landowner in California, while Diego's mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in [[Spain]], and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge ''[[hacienda]]'', which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels, leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro's operations and as Tornado's hiding place. In order to divert suspicion about his identity, Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a [[fop]].\n\nZorro made his debut in the 1919 novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', originally meant as a stand-alone story. However, the success of the 1920 film adaptation ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades: the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories, the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959, the year after his death. ''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]]. While the rest of McCulley's Zorro stories did not enjoy the same popularity, as most of them were never reprinted until the 21st century, the character also appears in over 40 films and in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957\u201359, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]. Other media featuring Zorro include stories by other authors, audio/radio dramas, comic books and strips, stage productions and video games.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books, with [[Batman]] drawing particularly close parallels to the character.\n\n== Publishing history ==\n[[File:Capistrano2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zorro's debut in the novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'' (1919).]]\nZorro debuted in [[Johnston McCulley]]'s novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', serialized in five parts between August 9 and September 6, 1919 in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=lat>{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Zorro still makes his mark|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/28/entertainment/et-zorro28|accessdate=October 18, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 2005}}</ref> The story was originally meant as a standalone tale, and at the [[denouement]], Zorro's true identity is revealed to all.\n\n[[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], on their [[honeymoon]], selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, [[United Artists]], beginning the character's cinematic tradition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The novel was adapted as the film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which Fairbanks produced, co-wrote and starred in as Diego/Zorro. The movie was a commercial success,<ref name=lat /> and the 1924 reprint of McCulley's story by publisher [[Grosset & Dunlap]] used the same title, capitalizing on the movie's popularity. The novel has since been reprinted using both titles.\n\nIn response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922. The 1922 story was ''The Further Adventures of Zorro'' and was also serialized in ''Argosy All-Story Weekly''. Fairbanks picked up the movie rights for the sequel that year. However, Fairbanks's sequel, ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925), was more based on the 1919 novel ''Don Q's Love Story'' by the mother-son duo Kate Prichard and [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] than ''The Further Adventures''. Thus McCulley received no credit on the film.<ref name=ths>{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Stuart|title=The Hollywood Sequel: History & Form, 1911\u20132010|date=2014|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=978-1-84457-843-6|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtYtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=The+Further+Adventures+of+Zorro+(1922)&source=bl&ots=TayFQci5_O&sig=t3lBdIeEx3syvLEVBUM7BA9jH0I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8xIOAgPvWAhWhz4MKHddhCBw4ChDoAQhNMAc#v=onepage&q=The%20Further%20Adventures%20of%20Zorro%20(1922)&f=false|accessdate=October 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt first, production of new Zorro stories proceeded at irregular intervals: the third novel, ''Zorro Rides Again'' (not to be confused with the 1937 theatrical serial) was published in 1931, nine years after the second one. Then, between 1932 and 1941, McCulley wrote four short stories and two serialized novels. Zorro stories were published much more frequently between 1944 and 1951, a period in which McCulley published 52 short stories with the character for the ''West Magazine''. \"Zorro Rides the Trail!\", which appeared in ''Max Brand's Western Magazine'' in 1954, is the last story to be published during the author's lifetime, and the second-to-last story overall. The last, \"The Mask of Zorro\" (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in ''Short Stories for Men'' in 1959. These stories [[Retroactive continuity|ignore]] Zorro's public revelation of his identity.\n\n''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]].

[http://www.boldventurepress.com Bold Venture Press] collected all McCulley's Zorro stories ''Zorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures'', in six volumes.\n\nOver 40 Zorro titled films were made over the years, including ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', the 1940 classic starring [[Tyrone Power]]. The character was also featured in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957\u2013'59, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]].<ref name=lat /> Zorro appears in several stories written by other authors, comics books and strips, stage productions, video games and other media. McCulley died in 1958, just as Zorro was at the height of his popularity thanks to the Disney series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:The Mark of Zorro (1920) - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the first Zorro film, ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which was instrumental in the early success of the character]]\n\nIn ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]],'' Se\u00f1or Zorro became an outlaw in the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|pueblo of Los Angeles]] in [[California]] \"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed\" and is dubbed the \"Curse of Capistrano\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless [[fop]], she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Do\u00f1a Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (''caballeros'') who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.\n\nIn later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.\n\nIn McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.\n\nSeveral Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.\n\nMcCulley's stories are set during the era of [[History of California#Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)|Spanish California]] (1769\u20131821)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Zorro.htm|title=The Legacy of the Fox:A Chronology of Zorro | publisher=|date= |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref> and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of [[History of California#Mexican period (1821 to 1846)|Mexican California]] (1821\u20131848).\n\n==Character motifs==\n[[File:Zorroandbernardo.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]) and Bernardo ([[Gene Sheldon]]) in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1957\u20131959 ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series]]\n\nThe character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cape or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]], and a black sackcloth [[mask]] that covers the top half of his head. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and in the television series ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957\u20131959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro's mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded [[domino mask]], which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro's cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a \"wide sombrero,\" and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nHis favored weapon is a [[rapier]], which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects. He also uses other weapons, including a [[bullwhip]] and a [[pistol]].\n\nThe [[fox]] is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics \"Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free {{nbsp}}...\" from [[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Disney's television series]] theme.\n\nHis heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.\n\n==Skills and resources==\n[[File:Zorroridesagain.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serial ''[[Zorro Rides Again]]'' (1937), starring [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as a descendant of the original Zorro]]\nZorro is an agile athlete and [[acrobat]], using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents.\n\nHis calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled him to use his two main weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent.\n\nIn some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro's boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat.\n\nZorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In ''The Curse of Capistrano'', it was unnamed. In Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series the horse gets the name [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his ''[[hacienda]]'' with a system of secret passages and tunnels.\n\nMcCulley's concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939), starring [[Reed Hadley]] as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks' version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley's stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney's ''Zorro'' television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro's secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master's charade. [[The CBN Family Channel|The Family Channel]]'s ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by [[Juan Diego Botto]], with a similar disability and pretense.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Zorro gip.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Reed Hadley]]) in the serial ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939)]]\n\nIn ''The Curse of Capistrano'', Diego is described as \"a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years, noted the length of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] for his small interest in the really important things of life.\" It is also said that \"Don Diego was unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times. It appeared that he disliked action. He seldom wore his blade, except as a matter of style and apparel. He was damnably polite to all women and paid court to none. ... Those who knew Don Diego best declared he yawned ten score times a day\". Though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. At the end of the novel, Diego explains that he has planned his double identity since he was fifteen:\n\n<blockquote>\"It began ten years ago, when I was but a lad of fifteen,\" he said. \"I heard tales of persecution. I saw my friends, the frailes, annoyed and robbed. I saw soldiers beat an old native who was my friend. And then I determined to play this game.\"\n\n\"It would be a difficult game to play, I knew. So I pretended to have small interest in life, so that men never would connect my name with that of the highwayman I expected to become. In secret, I practiced horsemanship and learned how to handle a blade\u2014\"\n\n\"By the saints, he did,\" Sergeant Gonzales growled.\n\n\"One half of me was the languid Don Diego you all knew, and the other half was the Curse of Capistrano I hoped one day to be. And then the time came, and my work began.\"\n\n\"It is a peculiar thing to explain, se\u00f1ores. The moment I donned cloak and mask, the Don Diego part of me fell away. My body straightened, new blood seemed to course through my veins, my voice grew strong and firm, fire came to me! And the moment I removed cloak and mask I was the languid Don Diego again. Is it not a peculiar thing?</blockquote>\n\nThis part of the backstory was changed in the 1920 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'': Diego is recently returned from [[Spain]] at the start of the movie, and Zorro later tells Lolita that he learnt his swordsmanship in Spain. The 1925 sequel ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' expands on this concept by saying that \"Though the home of the De Vegas has long been on California soil, the eldest son of each new generation returns to Spain for a period of travel and study.\" The 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' keeps the idea of Diego learning his swordsmanship in Spain, and adds the idea of him being unexpectedly summoned home by his father Don Alejandro when California fell into the hand of an oppressing dictator. Both ideas would then be included in most retelling of the character's backstory.\n\nMcCulley's portrayal of Diego's personality, with minor variations, is followed in most Zorro media.\n\nA notable exception to this portrayal is Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957\u201359), where Diego, despite using the original fa\u00e7ade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and simply masquerades as \"the most inept swordsman in all of California.\" In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does, but thinks he does not have the skill.\n\nThe Family Channel's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1990\u20131993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade is actually exaggerating his real interests. Diego is actually well-versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and to have no interest in swordplay or action. Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave in this version of the story.\n\n==Inspirations==\nThe historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is [[Joaquin Murrieta]], whose life was fictionalized in an 1854 [[dime novel]] by [[John Rollin Ridge]]. In the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' Murrieta's (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' [[pulp magazine|pulp series]] by [[Emma Orczy]].\n\nThe character recalls other figures, such as [[Robin Hood]], [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]], [[Salomon Pico]],<ref>Magill, Frank N. \"Magill's Survey of Cinema: Silent Films\". Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, 1982. and Tompkins, Walker. Decade of the Desperado. Santa Barbara Magazine Vol. 8 No. 4, Santa Barbara. 1982.</ref> [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza]], and [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]. Another possible historical inspiration is [[William Lamport]], an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by [[Vicente Riva Palacio]]; ''The Irish Zorro'' (2004) is a recent biography. Another is [[Estanislao]], a [[Yokuts]] man who led a revolt against the [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jose]] in 1827.\n\nThe 1890s [[penny dreadful]] treatment of the [[Spring-heeled Jack]] character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro's heroic persona. Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked [[alter ego]] to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter \"S\" into walls with his rapier as a calling card.\n\nLike Sir Percy in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete [[dandy]] who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character [[The Masked Rider (1919 film)|''The Masked Rider'']] (1919). This character was the first Mexican black-clad masked rider on a black horse to appear on the silver screen. Fairbanks's costume in ''The Mark of Zorro'', released the following year, resembled that of the Rider with only slight differences in the mask and hat.<ref>[http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ The Masked Rider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111122432/http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ |date=January 11, 2016 }} The Serial Squadron</ref>\n\n==Appearances in media==\n===Stories by Johnston McCulley===\n[[File:Argosy All-Story Weekly 19220506.jpg|thumb|''The Further Adventures of Zorro'', ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' Vol. 142 No. 4, May 6, 1922.]]\n* ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', ''[[All-Story Weekly]]'' Vol. 100 No. 2 \u2013 Vol. 101 No. 2, serialized in five parts, August 9, 1919 \u2013 September 6, 1919 \u2013 novella ''The Curse of Capistrano'' published by [[Grosset & Dunlap]] in 1919, and reissued as ''The Mark of Zorro'' in 1924 by the same editor\n* ''The Further Adventures of Zorro'', ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' Vol. 142 No. 4 \u2013 Vol. 143 No. 3, serialized in six parts, May 6, 1922 \u2013 June 10, 1922\n* ''Zorro Rides Again'', ''Argosy'' Vol. 224 No. 3 \u2013 Vol. 224 No. 6, serialized in four parts, October 3, 1931 \u2013 October 24, 1931\n* \"Zorro Saves A Friend\", ''Argosy'' Vol. 234 No. 1, November 12, 1932\n* \"Zorro Hunts A Jackal\", ''Argosy'' Vol. 237 No. 6, April 22, 1933 (a.k.a.

Gertz died in 1961, and his estate transferred to his children, who created Zorro Productions, Inc. Fireworks Entertainment argued that the original rights had already been transferred to [[Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] in 1920 and provided documents showing this was legally affirmed in 1929, and also questioned whether the copyright was still valid.\n\nThe court ruled that \"since the copyrights in ''The Curse of Capistrano'' and ''The Mark of Zorro'' lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain\".<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573994030226630518&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr#r&#91;31&#93; Note 31] of ''Sony Pictures Entertainment v.

The main character is played by [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Robert Livingston]], who would then play the actual Zorro in the movie ''[[The Bold Caballero]]'', also released in 1936.\n\n[[The Masked Rider]], the primary [[mascot]] of [[Texas Tech University]], is similar to Zorro. Originally called \"Ghost Rider\", it was an unofficial mascot appearing in a few games in 1936 and then became the official mascot with the 1954 Gator Bowl.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books. [[Bob Kane]] has credited Zorro as part of the inspiration for the character [[Batman]], which was created in 1939.<ref>Boichel, Bill. \"Batman: Commodity as Myth.\" The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Like Don Diego de la Vega, Bruce Wayne is [[affluent]], the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish and uncaring to throw off suspicion. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s comic book miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' (2001\u20132002) both include multiple Zorro references like the Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman's origins, Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', starring [[Tyrone Power]].\n\nZorro inspired a similar pulp character known as [[El Coyote (fictional character)|El Coyote]], which was created in 1943 by Jos\u00e9 Mallorqu\u00ed. A sample superhero character called The Fox appearing in the ''[[GURPS Supers|Supers]]'' supplement of the [[GURPS|GURPS role-playing system]] is also based on Zorro.\n\nThe 1954 ''[[Man with the Steel Whip]]'' [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serial features a masked hero similar to Zorro, called El Latigo. Republic had previously released five Zorro serials between 1937 and 1949, but had since lost the licence for the character and could not use him anymore. The serial makes frequent use of [[stock footage]] from all five Zorro serials, with scenes originally showing Zorro now being interpreted as showing El Latigo: the result of this is that the costume and body shape of El Latigo keeps changing between scenes, even becoming female in scenes taken from ''[[Zorro's Black Whip]]'' (1944).<ref name=\"GMS\">{{cite book | last = Harmon| first = Jim |author2=[[Donald F.

Hanna-Barbera Production's animated series ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' (1959\u20131962) features El Kabong, an alternate persona of the main character [[Quick Draw McGraw]], which is loosely based upon Zorro.\n\nIn the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001\u20132004), a DC Comics character, [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], bears a striking similarity to Zorro, in that he wears the same style hat, mask, sash and cape. The main difference is that his primary weapon is a whip. The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004\u20132006), voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro's appearance were added in. Seen in the episode \"[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]\" (2005), he appears alongside [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[Bat Lash]] and [[Jonah Hex]].\n\nIn 2015, The M7 Con Western Convention, held at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] featured a segment on the history of Zorro in film and television. The presentation focused on the great Zorro actors including [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], and [[Duncan Regehr]]. Maestro Ramon Martinez and actor [[Alex Kruz]] gave a live demonstration of the [[Spain|Spanish]] style of fencing known as La Verdadera [[Destreza]]. The two dueled live as Zorro and the Comandante much to the delight of the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zorro-swashbucklingnewsandupdates.blogspot.com/2015/12/m7-con-2015-alex-kruz-appears-as-zorro.html|title='M7 Con 2015 Alex Kruz Appears As Zorro\u2019}}</ref>\n\nA cave that was used as a filming location in various Zorro productions is now known as \"Zorro's Cave\" and remains in place, now hidden behind a condominium complex, on land that was once the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, Calif.]], recognized as the most widely filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Legend of Zorro'' by Bill Yenne 1991 Mallard Press {{ISBN|978-0-7924-5547-9}}\n* ''Zorro Unmasked: The Official History'' by Sandra Curtis 1998 Hyperion {{ISBN|978-0-7868-8285-4}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.zorro.com Zorro Productions, Inc.]\n* [http://www.billcotter.com/zorro A guide to the Walt Disney television series version of ''Zorro'']\n* [http://www.newworldzorro.com A comprehensive guide to the New World ''Zorro'' television series]\n* [http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Zorro.htm The Legacy of the Fox: A Chronology of Zorro]\n* {{INDUCKSCode|Type=character|Code=ZOR}}\n* [https://inducks.org/character.php?c=Diego Don Diego de la Vega] at the [[INDUCKS]]\n\n{{Zorro}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Zorro| ]]\n[[Category:Characters in pulp fiction]]\n[[Category:Dynamite Entertainment characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional acrobats]]\n[[Category:Fictional Alta California people]]\n[[Category:Fictional human rights activists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1919]]\n[[Category:Fictional gentleman thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional nobility]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional slaves]]\n[[Category:Fictional fencers]]\n[[Category:Fictional flexible weapons practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Film serial characters]]\n[[Category:Media franchises]]\n[[Category:Series of books]]\n[[Category:Topps Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Latin American superheroes]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of California]]\n", "name_user": "Nicholas0", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAmerican theatrical feature films:starred -> starring", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro"}

Later, Gonzalez stars in ''[[Cielo Rojo]]'', and Louvier in ''[[Emperatriz]]''. Most cast and crews have worked together in other telenovelas produced by Azteca such as '' [[Cuando seas m\u00eda]]'' (Fernando Gaitan, Elisa Salinas, Juan David Burns, Sergio Basanez, Iliana Fox, Rodrigo Abed, Rodrigo Cachero, and Alejandro Lukini) and ''[[La duda]]'' (Jose Carlos Rodriguez, Fabiana Perzabal). Venezuelan actress Johanna Morales is promoted from recurring role to starring role in Episode 74.\n\nThe second season is filmed in Mexico. Since Venezuelan actress Johanna Morales could not continue to stay in Mexico, therefore her character is killed off.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{TV Azteca telenovelas and series in 2010-2019}}\n{{Grey's Anatomy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corazon Abierto (Mexican Telenovela), A}}\n[[Category:2011 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2011 Mexican television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 Mexican television series endings]]\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy]]\n[[Category:Mexican telenovelas]]\n[[Category:TV Azteca telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Medical telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Mexican television series based on American television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{cleanup reorganize|date=October 2017}}\n{{condense|date=October 2017}}\n{{confusing|date=October 2017}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name            = A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\n | image                = A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto casts.jpg\n | caption              =\n | genre                = [[Medical drama]]\n | camera               = [[Multicamera setup|Multi-camera]]\n | picture_format       = [[Color]] HDTV, 1080i\n | runtime              = 42&nbsp;minutes\n | creator              = [[Shonda Rhimes]]<br />[[Fernando Gait\u00e1n]]<br />'''Season 2:'''<br />Luis Felipe Ybarra\n | writer               = '''Season 1:'''<br />[[Fernando Gait\u00e1n]]<br />'''Season 2:'''<br />Jos\u00e9 Luis Duran<br />Luis Felipe Ybarra\n | developer            = [[RCN Television Colombia]] <br />'''RCN Telenovelas:''' <br />[[Alberto Santini Lara]]<br />[[Elisa Salinas]]<br />[[Disney Media Networks]]<br />[[Vista Productions]] (Season 1 only)\n | producer             = '''Season 1:'''<br />Juan David Burns <br />'''Season 2:'''<br /> Elisa Salinas\n | executive_producer   = '''Disney Media Latin Networks:'''<br />Fernando Barbosa<br />Leonardo Aranguibel<br />'''Season 1:'''<br />Alberto Santini Lara<br />Yuldor Guti\u00e9rrez<br />'''Season 2:'''<br />Pedro Lira<br />Pedro Luevano\n | director             = Raul Quintanilla<br />Julian Atu\u00f1ano<br />'''Season 1:'''<br />Wiliam Barragan\n | starring             = [[Sergio Basa\u00f1ez]]<br />[[Iliana Fox]]<br />Rodrigo Abed<br />Leonardo Garcia<br />Fran Meric<br />Luis Ernesto Franco<br />Laura Palma<br />Adrian Rubio<br />Fabiana Perzabal<br />Alejandro Lukini<br />Luis Miguel Lombana<br />Carmen Madrid<br />Angelica Aragon\n | narrated             =\n | theme_music_composer = Mauricio Abaroa\n | opentheme            = '''''\"Vive\"''''' by [[Marta S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Samuel Castel\u00e1n Marini|Samuel Castelli]]\n | endtheme             =\n | country              = [[Mexico]]\n | language             = Spanish\n | network              = [[RCN Television]]\n | location             = [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]]\n | first_aired          = 9 November 2011\n | last_aired           = 25 May 2012\n | related              = ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'', [[A coraz\u00f3n abierto (Colombian TV series)|''A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto'' (Colombian telenovela)]]\n | num_episodes         = 138\n | list_episodes        =\n | preceded_by          = [[Emperatriz]]\n | followed_by          = [[Amor Cautivo]]\n | website              =http://canalrcnmsn.com/programas/coraz\u00f3n_abierto\n}}\n'''''A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto''''' is a Mexican telenovela produced by [[RCN Television]] in collaboration with Vista Production (first season only) and Disney Media Network Latin America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informador.com.mx/entretenimiento/2011/264587/6/presentan-a-corazon-abierto-nueva-serie-de-tv-azteca-y-disney.htm |title=Presentan ''A coraz\u00f3n abierto'', nueva serie de TV Azteca y Disney |author=NTX / IAMR |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2011|language=Spanish |trans-title=Presenting ''A coraz\u00f3n abierto'', the new series of TV Azteca and Disney}}</ref> Based on [[Shonda Rhimes]]' ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', it is adapted and supervised by Colombian writer, [[Fernando Gait\u00e1n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttvmedianews.com/scripts/templates/estilo_nota.asp?nota=eng%2FTV+Abierta%2FContenidos%2F2011%2F11_noviembre%2F11_estreno_A_Corazon_Abierto_Mexico |title=A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto Premieres in Mexico |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912115337/http://www.ttvmedianews.com/scripts/templates/estilo_nota.asp?nota=eng%2FTV+Abierta%2FContenidos%2F2011%2F11_noviembre%2F11_estreno_A_Corazon_Abierto_Mexico |archivedate=12 September 2014 }}</ref> It marks the return of [[Sergio Basa\u00f1ez]] as a protagonist with the presentation of Iliana Fox as a protagonist.

Later, Gonzalez stars in ''[[Cielo Rojo]]'', and Louvier in ''[[Emperatriz]]''. Most cast and crews have worked together in other telenovelas produced by Azteca such as '' [[Cuando seas m\u00eda]]'' (Fernando Gaitan, Elisa Salinas, Juan David Burns, Sergio Basanez, Iliana Fox, Rodrigo Abed, Rodrigo Cachero, and Alejandro Lukini) and ''[[La Duda]]'' (Jose Carlos Rodriguez, Fabiana Perzabal). Venezuelan actress Johanna Morales is promoted from recurring role to starring role in Episode 74.\n\nThe second season is filmed in Mexico. Since Venezuelan actress Johanna Morales could not continue to stay in Mexico, therefore her character is killed off.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{TV Azteca telenovelas and series in 2010-2019}}\n{{Grey's Anatomy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corazon Abierto (Mexican Telenovela), A}}\n[[Category:2011 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2011 Mexican television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 Mexican television series endings]]\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy]]\n[[Category:Mexican telenovelas]]\n[[Category:TV Azteca telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Medical telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Mexican television series based on American television series]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromLa DudatoLa dudausingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_coraz%C3%B3n_abierto_(Mexican_TV_series)"}

His mixing skills and innovative style were quickly noticed and he was soon offered a residency at legendary Manchester club, [[The Ha\u00e7ienda|Fac 51 The Hacienda]]. Dasilva and DJ [[Mike Pickering]] started the wildly popular Ibiza-inspired HOT nights, which are seen by many as the birthplace of UK [[acid house]], alongside [[Danny Rampling]]'s Shoom.\n\nDuring his residency at [[The Ha\u00e7ienda|The Hacienda]], he became well known for his use of a cappella vocals and sound effects. Such techniques influenced a new generation of young DJs, including [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]], who credits Dasilva for teaching him how to mix harmonically and build sets.\n\nSince leaving [[The Ha\u00e7ienda|The Hacienda]], Dasilva's career has taken him around the world. He was the first guest DJ to be booked by Slam (Soma Records) in Glasgow back in 1989, first UK DJ to play Tresor in Berlin around 1990. He was also one of the first British DJs to play China in the mid-90s, and was resident on the first Strictly Rhythm Records Tour alongside Todd Terry and a young Roger Sanchez. Since 2015 he has been one of the resident DJs at 'I Love Acid', currently the longest running dedicated, regular Acid House clubnight in the UK (established 2007) and winner of [[DJ Mag]]'s Best Club Event 2019 award.\n\n<br />\n\n== Production ==\nJon has remixed for bands such as; [[New Fast Automatic Daffodils]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[A Certain Ratio]], [[Inspiral Carpets]] and [[M People]], and has released productions on labels including Ellum Audio, Rush Hour, Soma, Mute, Deconstruction, Better Days, Eskimo, DMC and many others. \n\nSome release highlights include \"Soul On Ice\" featuring [[Rowetta]] from the [[Happy Mondays]] on vocals, \"Hot\" by Ideal, Jon's most successful solo project to date and Jon's blistering remix of Screen IIs, \"Hey Mr. DJ\", on Cleveland City Records. Jon was signed to Cleveland City for some years.\n\nIn 2013, Jon collaborated with [[Maceo Plex]] to produce \"Love Somebody Else\" which won \"Best House Track\" that year at the International Dance Awards in Miami.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The [[List of Nepenthes species by distribution|greatest diversity]] occurs on [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], and the Philippines, with many [[endemism|endemic]] species.

A few are considered tropical alpine, with cool days and nights near freezing.

From the stems arise alternate, sword-shaped leaves with entire [[leaf margin]]s. An extension of the [[midrib]] (the [[tendril]]), which in some species aids in climbing, protrudes from the tip of the leaf; at the end of the tendril the pitcher forms. The pitcher starts as a small bud and gradually expands to form a globe- or tube-shaped trap.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" /> The shapes can evoke a champagne flute or a condom.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lifeform of the week carnivorous plants are out for blood|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/lifeform-of-the-week-carnivorous-plants-are-out-for-blood | work=Earthsky | date=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nepenthes pitcher morphology upper.svg|thumb|250px|left|Basic structure of an upper pitcher]]\n\nThe trap contains a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or [[syrup]]y, and is used to drown the prey. This fluid contains [[viscoelastic]] [[biopolymers]] that may be crucial to the retention of insects within the traps of many species.  The viscoelastic fluid in pitchers is especially effective in the retention of winged insects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bonhomme|first1=V.|title=Slippery or sticky?

Along the upper inside part of the trap is a slick, waxy coating which makes the escape of its prey nearly impossible. Surrounding the entrance to the trap is a structure called the [[peristome]] (the \"lip\"), which is slippery and often quite colorful, attracting prey, but offering an unsure footing.  The prey-capture effectiveness of the peristome is further enhanced in moist environments, where condensation may cause a thin water film to form on the surface of the peristome.  When wet, the slippery surface of the peristome causes insects to \u2018aquaplane\u2019, or slip and fall, into the pitcher.<ref name=\"Moran 2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Moran|first1=J.A.|title=The carnivorous syndrome in Nepenthes pitcher plants|journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior|date=2010|volume=5|issue=6|pages=644\u2013648|doi=10.4161/psb.5.6.11238|pmid=21135573|pmc=3001552}}</ref>  Above the peristome is a lid (the [[operculum (botany)|operculum]]); in many species, this keeps rain from diluting the fluid within the pitcher, the underside of which may contain [[nectar]] glands which attract prey.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" />\n\n''Nepenthes'' species usually produce two types of pitchers, known as leaf dimorphism. Appearing near the base of the plant are the large, lower traps, which typically sit on the ground. The upper or aerial pitchers are usually larger, coloured differently, and possess different features from the lower pitchers. These upper pitchers usually form as the plant reaches maturity and the plant grows taller. To keep the plant steady, the upper pitchers often form a loop in the tendril, allowing it to wrap around nearby support. In some species (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N.&nbsp;rafflesiana]]''), different prey may be attracted by the two types of pitchers.

Although ''Nepenthes'' is distantly related to several modern genera, among these, even the carnivorous relatives [the sundews (''[[Drosera]]''), Venus flytrap (''[[Dionea muscipula]]''), waterwheel plant (''[[Aldrovanda]]''), and dewy pine (''[[Drosophyllum]]'')], all lack those traits.  Among known ''Nepenthes'', no protomodern characteristics or large variations are found, which suggests that all extant species radiated from a single close ancestor bearing all the modern traits. [[Phylogenetic]] comparisons of the [[chloroplast]] ''[[Maturase K|matK]] ''gene sequences between ''Nepenthes'' species and with related species support this conclusion, long genetic distance between ''Nepenthes'' and others, and abruptly diverging \"pom-pom\" grouping of the ''Nepenthes'' species .<ref name=ICPS_phylogeny>{{cite webpage | last1 = Brittnacher | first1 = John | year = 2011 | title = Evolution -- Nepenthes Phylogeny | url = http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cp/EvolutionNepenthes.php | journal = ICPS Webpage | access-date = 2011-02-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043826/http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cp/EvolutionNepenthes.php | archive-date = 2011-05-14 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFossilized pollen of ''Nepenthes''-like plants living on the northern [[Tethys Sea]] from 65 to 35 million years ago indicates that then-warmer Europe may have been where the proto-''Nepenthes'' developed, and then escaped to Asia and India as Africa collided with Europe and the ensuing climate change wiped out the ancestral species in the original habitat. About 20 million years ago, [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Sulawesi]] and possibly even the Philippines were connected to mainland Asia, providing a bridge for the colonization of most sites of ''Nepenthes'' species radiation. The extensive landbridges in the area 20,000 years ago during the ice age would have provided access to the remaining sites of ''Nepenthes'' populations in [[Oceania]]. The main complication with this hypothesis is the presence of ''Nepenthes'' on the distant islands of [[Seychelles]] and [[Madagascar]]. The seeds were thought to have been transferred by [[seabirds]] and [[shorebirds]], which rest during their migrations in swampy habitats and may have inadvertently picked up the seeds.

Some species (e.g. ''N.&nbsp;mirabilis'') have been found growing in [[clearcutting|clear-cut]] forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in [[savanna]]-like grass communities. The soils in which ''Nepenthes'' species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of [[peat]], white sand, [[sandstone]], or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] content (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N.&nbsp;rajah]]''), on sandy beaches in the [[sea spray]] zone (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes albomarginata|N.&nbsp;albomarginata]]'').

''Nepenthes'' species certainly attract and kill their prey, albeit passively, through active production of attractive colours, sugary [[nectar]], and even sweet scents. From this relationship, the plants primarily gain [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] to supplement their nutrient requirements for growth, given these soil nutrients are typically lacking. The most frequent prey is an abundant and diverse group of [[arthropod]]s, with [[ant]]s and other [[insect]]s topping the menu. Other arthropods found frequently include [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, while [[snail]]s and [[frog]]s are more unusual, but not unheard of. The most uncommon prey for ''Nepenthes'' species includes rats found in ''N.&nbsp;rajah''.

The complex ecological relationship between pitcher plants and infauna is not yet fully understood, but the relationship may be [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]]: the infauna is given shelter, food, or protection, and the plant that harbours the infauna receives expedited breakdown of captured prey, increasing the rate of digestion and keeping harmful bacterial populations repressed.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997\" /><ref name=\"Mogi 1992\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mogi | first1 = M. | last2 = Yong | first2 = H.S. | year = 1992 | title = Aquatic arthropod communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitchers: the role of niche differentiation, aggregation, predation and competition in community organization | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 90 | issue = 2| pages = 172\u2013184 | doi = 10.1007/BF00317174 | pmid = 28313712 }}</ref><ref name=\"Beaver 1979\">{{cite journal | last1 = Beaver | first1 = R.A. | year = 1979 | title = Fauna and foodwebs of pitcher plants in west Malaysia | url = | journal = Malayan Nature Journal | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1\u201310 }}</ref>\n\n=== Antimicrobial properties ===\n''Nepenthes'' digestive fluids are sterile before pitchers open and contain secondary metabolites and proteins that act as [[bactericide]]s and fungicides after the pitcher opens.

Once the bacteria and fungi enter the fluid, secondary metabolites are produced in addition to antimicrobial proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mith\u00f6fer|first=Axel|date=2011-09-01|title=Carnivorous pitcher plants: Insights in an old topic|url=|journal=Phytochemistry|series=Plant-Insect Interactions|volume=72|issue=13|pages=1678\u20131682|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.11.024|pmid=21185041}}</ref> [[Naphthoquinone]]s, a class of secondary metabolite, are commonly produced, and these either kill or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria and fungi.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buch|first=Franziska|last2=Rott|first2=Matthias|last3=Rottloff|first3=Sandy|last4=Paetz|first4=Christian|last5=Hilke|first5=Ines|last6=Raessler|first6=Michael|last7=Mith\u00f6fer|first7=Axel|date=2012-12-21|title=Secreted pitfall-trap fluid of carnivorous Nepenthes plants is unsuitable for microbial growth|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/20/aob.mcs287|journal=Annals of Botany|language=en|pages=375\u201383|doi=10.1093/aob/mcs287|issn=0305-7364|pmc=3579442|pmid=23264234|volume=111|issue=3}}</ref> This adaptation could have evolved since ''Nepenthes'' plants that could produce secondary metabolites and antimicrobial proteins to kill bacteria and fungi were most likely more fit. Plants that produced antimicrobial compounds could prevent loss of valuable nutrients gained from insects within the pitcher. Since ''Nepenthes'' cannot digest certain bacteria and fungi, the bactericides and fungicides allow plants to maximize nutrient uptake.\n\n==Botanical history==\n[[File:Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium.jpg|thumb|right|Plukenet's drawing of ''N.&nbsp;distillatoria'' from his ''Almagestum Botanicum'' of 1696.]]\nThe earliest known record of ''Nepenthes'' dates back to the 17th century. In 1658, French colonial governor [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]] published a description of a pitcher plant in his seminal work ''Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar''.  It reads:<ref>de Flacourt, \u00c9. 1658. ''Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar''.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is a plant growing about 3 feet high which carries at the end of its leaves, which are 7 inches long, a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight. There are red ones and yellow ones, the yellow being the biggest. The inhabitants of this country are reluctant to pick the flowers, saying that if somebody does pick them in passing, it will not fail to rain that day. As to that, I and all the other Frenchmen did pick them, but it did not rain. After rain these flowers are full of water, each one containing a good half-glass. [translated from French in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\nFlacourt called the plant ''Amramatico'', after a local name. More than a century later, this species was [[Species description|formally described]] as ''[[Nepenthes madagascariensis|N.&nbsp;madagascariensis]]''.<ref name=Poiret>Poiret, J.L.M. 1797. ''N\u00e9pente''. In: J.B. Lamarck ''Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique Botanique'' Vol. 4.</ref>\n\nThe second species to be described was ''[[Nepenthes distillatoria|N.&nbsp;distillatoria]]'', the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[endemism|endemic]]. In 1677, Danish physician [[Thomas Bartholin]]<!--Bartolinus--> made brief mention of it under the name ''Miranda herba'', Latin for \"marvellous herb\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bartholinus | year = | title = Miranda herba | url = | journal = Acta Medica et Philosophica Hafniensia | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 38 }}</ref> Three years later, Dutch merchant [[Jacob Breyne]] referred to this species as ''Bandura zingalensium'', after a local name for the plant.<ref>Breyne, J. 1680. ''Bandura zingalensium'' etc. ''Prodromus Fasciculi Rariorum Plantarum'' 1: 18.</ref> ''Bandura'' subsequently became the most commonly used name for the tropical pitcher plants, until Linnaeus coined ''Nepenthes'' in 1737.<ref name=P&L />\n\n''Nepenthes distillatoria'' was again described in 1683, this time by Swedish physician and naturalist [[Herman Niklas Grim]]<!--also known as Hermann Nicolaus Grimm, Hermannus Nicolaus Grimmius-->.<ref>Grimm, H.N. 1683. ''Planta mirabilis destillatoria''. In: Miscellanea curiosa sive Ephemeridum. ''Med. Phys. Germ. Acad. Nat. Cur. Decuriae'' 2, ann. prim. p. 363, f. 27.</ref> Grim called it ''Planta mirabilis destillatoria'' or the \"miraculous distilling plant\", and was the first to clearly illustrate a tropical pitcher plant.<ref name=P&L /> Three years later, in 1686, English naturalist [[John Ray]] quoted Grim as saying:<ref>Ray, J. 1686. ''Bandura cingalensium'' etc. ''Historia Plantarum'' 1: 721\u2013722.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The root draws up moisture from the earth which with the help of the sun's rays rises up into the plant itself and then flows down through the stems and nerves of the leaves into the natural utensil to be stored there until used for human needs. [translated from Latin in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\nOne of the earliest illustrations of ''Nepenthes'' appears in Leonard Plukenet's ''Almagestum Botanicum'' of 1696.<ref>Plukenet, L. 1696. ''Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium''. In: ''Almagestum Botanicum''.</ref> The plant, called ''Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium'', is undoubtedly ''N.&nbsp;distillatoria''.<ref name =P&L />\n\n[[File:Cantharifera - Herbarium amboinense (1747).jpg|thumb|left|''Cantharifera'' as illustrated in Rumphius's ''Herbarium Amboinensis'', Volume 5, published in 1747, although probably drawn in the late 17th century. The vine on the right is not a ''Nepenthes'', but a species of ''[[Flagellaria]]''.]]\n\nAround the same time, German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] discovered two new ''Nepenthes'' species in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Rumphius illustrated the first one, now considered synonymous with  ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis|N.&nbsp;mirabilis]]'', and gave it the name ''Cantharifera'', meaning \"tankard-bearer\". The second, referred to as ''Cantharifera&nbsp;alba'', is thought to have been ''[[Nepenthes maxima|N.&nbsp;maxima]]''. Rumphius described the plants in his most famous work, the six-volume ''Herbarium Amboinense'', a catalogue of the [[flora]] of [[Ambon Island]]. However, it would not be published until many years after his death.<ref>Rumphius, G.E. 1741\u20131750. ''Cantharifera''. In: ''Herbarium Amboinense'' 5, lib. 7, cap. 61, p. 121, t. 59, t. 2.</ref>\n\nAfter going blind in 1670, when the manuscript was only partially complete, Rumphius continued work on ''Herbarium Amboinensis'' with the help of clerks and artists. In 1687, with the project nearing completion, at least half of the illustrations were lost in a fire. Persevering, Rumphius and his helpers first completed the book in 1690. However, two years later, the ship carrying the manuscript to the Netherlands was attacked and sunk by the French, forcing them to start over from a copy that had fortunately been retained by Governor-General Johannes Camphuijs. The ''Herbarium Amboinensis'' finally arrived in the Netherlands in 1696. Even then, the first volume did not appear until 1741, 39 years after Rumphius's death. By this time, Linnaeus's name ''Nepenthes'' had become established.<ref name=P&L />\n\n[[File:Nepenthes distillatoria - Thesaurus zeylanicus (1737).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of ''Bandura&nbsp;zeylanica'' (''N.&nbsp;distillatoria'') from Burmann's ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus'' of 1737]]\n\n''Nepenthes distillatoria'' was again illustrated in [[Johannes Burmann]]'s ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus'' of 1737. The drawing depicts the end of a flowering stem with pitchers. Burmann refers to the plant as ''Bandura zeylanica''.<ref>Burmann, J. 1737. ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus''. Amsterdam.</ref>\n\nThe next mention of tropical pitcher plants was made in 1790, when Portuguese priest [[Jo\u00e3o de Loureiro]] described ''Phyllamphora&nbsp;mirabilis'', or the \"marvellous urn-shaped leaf\", from [[Vietnam]]. Despite living in the country for around 35 years, it seems unlikely that Loureiro observed living plants of this species, as he stated the lid is a moving part, [[rapid plant movement|actively opening and closing]]. In his most celebrated work, ''Flora Cochinchinensis'', he writes:<ref>de Loureiro, J. 1790. ''Flora Cochinchinensis'' 2: 606\u2013607.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[...] (the) leaf-tip ends in a long hanging tendril, twisted spirally in the middle, from which hangs a sort of vase, oblong, pot-bellied, with a smooth lip with a projecting margin and a lid affixed to one side, which of its own nature freely opens and closes in order to receive the dew and store it. A marvellous work of the Lord! [translated from French in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\n''Phyllamphora&nbsp;mirabilis'' was eventually transferred to the genus ''Nepenthes'' by Rafarin in 1869.<ref>Schlauer, J. {{Tooltip| N.d. | No date}} [http://www.omnisterra.com/bot/cp_home.cgi?name=Nepenthes+mirabilis ''Nepenthes mirabilis'']. Carnivorous Plant Database.</ref> As such, ''P.&nbsp;mirabilis'' is the [[basionym]] of this most cosmopolitan of tropical pitcher plant species.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997\"/>\n\nLoureiro's description of a moving lid was repeated by [[Jean Louis Marie Poiret]] in 1797. Poiret described two of the four ''Nepenthes'' species known at the time: ''N.&nbsp;madagascariensis'' and ''N.&nbsp;distillatoria''. He gave the former its current name and called the latter ''Nepente de l'Inde'', or simply \"''Nepenthes'' of India\", although this species is absent from the mainland.  In [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique Botanique'', he included the following account:<ref name=Poiret />\n\n<blockquote>This urn is hollow, as I have just said, usually full of soft, clear water, and then closed. It opens during the day and more than half the liquid disappears, but this loss is repaired during the night, and the next day the urn is full again and closed by its lid. This is its sustenance, and enough for more than one day because it is always about half-full at the approach of night. [translated from French in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Veitch Nepenthes house.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Nepenthes'' house of the [[Veitch Nurseries]] as illustrated in ''[[The Gardeners' Chronicle]]'', 1872]]\n\nWith the discovery of new species and [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks']] original introduction of specimens to Europe in 1789, interest in ''Nepenthes'' grew throughout the 19th century, culminating in what has been called the \"Golden Age of ''Nepenthes''\" in the 1880s.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\">Barthlott, W., Porembski, S., Seine, R., and Theisen, I. 2007. ''The Curious World of Carnivorous Plants.'' Portland, Oregon: Timber Press.</ref><ref name=P&L /> However, the popularity of the plants dwindled in the early 20th century, before all but disappearing by [[World War II]]. This is evidenced by the fact that no new species were described between 1940 and 1966. The revival of global interest in the cultivation and study of ''Nepenthes'' is credited to [[Japan]]ese botanist [[Shigeo Kurata]], whose work in the 1960s and 1970s did much to bring attention to these plants.<ref name=Sarawak>Clarke, C.M. & C.C.

Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works as long as it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in dissolved solid and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow in full sun), a well-drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as ''N.&nbsp;alata'' can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength. Occasional feeding with frozen (thawed before use) [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s may be beneficial.

Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped ''[[Sphagnum]]'' [[moss]], or on sterile plant tissue culture media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or [[perlite]] has been used for germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp ''Sphagnum'' moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. [[Plant tissue culture|Tissue culture]] is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices.

The [[List of Nepenthes species by distribution|greatest diversity]] occurs on [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], and the Philippines, with many [[endemism|endemic]] species. Many are plants of hot, humid, lowland areas, but the majority are tropical [[montane]] plants, receiving warm days but cool to cold, humid nights year round. A few are considered tropical alpine, with cool days and nights near freezing.  The name \"monkey cups\" refers to the fact that [[monkey]]s have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Nepenthes in the Southern Western Ghats.jpg|thumb|''Nepenthes mirabilis'' at the [[Periyar Tiger Reserve]], in Southern [[Western Ghats]] of India]]\n''Nepenthes'' species usually consist of a shallow root system and a [[prostrate shrub|prostrate]] or climbing stem, often several metres long and up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} or more, and usually {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or less in diameter, although this may be thicker in a few species (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes bicalcarata|N.&nbsp;bicalcarata]]''). From the stems arise alternate, sword-shaped leaves with entire [[leaf margin]]s. An extension of the [[midrib]] (the [[tendril]]), which in some species aids in climbing, protrudes from the tip of the leaf; at the end of the tendril the pitcher forms. The pitcher starts as a small bud and gradually expands to form a globe- or tube-shaped trap.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" /> The shapes can evoke a champagne flute or a condom.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lifeform of the week carnivorous plants are out for blood|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/lifeform-of-the-week-carnivorous-plants-are-out-for-blood | work=Earthsky | date=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nepenthes pitcher morphology upper.svg|thumb|250px|left|Basic structure of an upper pitcher]]\n\nThe trap contains a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or [[syrup]]y, and is used to drown the prey. This fluid contains [[viscoelastic]] [[biopolymers]] that may be crucial to the retention of insects within the traps of many species.  The viscoelastic fluid in pitchers is especially effective in the retention of winged insects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bonhomme|first1=V.|title=Slippery or sticky?

Along the upper inside part of the trap is a slick, waxy coating which makes the escape of its prey nearly impossible. Surrounding the entrance to the trap is a structure called the [[peristome]] (the \"lip\"), which is slippery and often quite colorful, attracting prey, but offering an unsure footing.  The prey-capture effectiveness of the peristome is further enhanced in moist environments, where condensation may cause a thin water film to form on the surface of the peristome.  When wet, the slippery surface of the peristome causes insects to \u2018aquaplane\u2019, or slip and fall, into the pitcher.<ref name=\"Moran 2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Moran|first1=J.A.|title=The carnivorous syndrome in Nepenthes pitcher plants|journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior|date=2010|volume=5|issue=6|pages=644\u2013648|doi=10.4161/psb.5.6.11238|pmid=21135573|pmc=3001552}}</ref>  Above the peristome is a lid (the [[operculum (botany)|operculum]]); in many species, this keeps rain from diluting the fluid within the pitcher, the underside of which may contain [[nectar]] glands which attract prey.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" />\n\n''Nepenthes'' species usually produce two types of pitchers, known as leaf dimorphism. Appearing near the base of the plant are the large, lower traps, which typically sit on the ground. The upper or aerial pitchers are usually smaller, coloured differently, and possess different features from the lower pitchers. These upper pitchers usually form as the plant reaches maturity and the plant grows taller. To keep the plant steady, the upper pitchers often form a loop in the tendril, allowing it to wrap around nearby support. In some species (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N.&nbsp;rafflesiana]]''), different prey may be attracted by the two types of pitchers. This varied morphology also often makes identification of species difficult.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" />\n\nPrey usually consists of [[insects]],  but the largest species (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N.&nbsp;rajah]]'' and ''N.&nbsp;rafflesiana'') may occasionally catch small [[vertebrate]]s, such as rats and lizards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Phillipps | first1 = A | year = 1988 | title = ''A second record of rats as prey in ''Nepenthes rajah | url = http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv17n2p55.pdf | journal = [[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2| page = 55 }}</ref><ref>Moran, J.A. 1991.

Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref>\n\n''Nepenthes'' was formally published as a [[genus|generic]] name in 1753 in Linnaeus's famous ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', which established [[botanical nomenclature]] as it exists today. ''Nepenthes distillatoria'' is the [[type species]] of the genus.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Linnaeus | first1 = C | year = 1753 | title = Nepenthes | url = | journal = Species Plantarum | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 955 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nepenthes Species Plantarum.jpg|thumb|400px|''Nepenthes'' from Carolus Linnaeus's ''Species Plantarum'' of 1753]]\n\nThe name \"monkey cups\" was discussed in the May 1964 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', in which Paul A. Zahl wrote:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zahl | first1 = P.A. | year = 1964 | title = Malaysia's Giant Flowers and Insect-trapping Plants | url = | journal = National Geographic | volume = 125 | issue = 5| pages = 680\u2013701 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The carriers called them \"monkey cups,\" a name I had heard elsewhere in reference to ''Nepenthes'', but the implication that monkeys drink the pitcher fluid seemed farfetched. I later proved it true. In Sarawak, I found an [[orangutan]] that had been raised as a pet and later freed. As I approached it gingerly in the forest, I offered it a half-full pitcher. To my surprise, the ape accepted it, and with the finesse of a lady at tea, executed a delicate bottoms-up.</blockquote>\n\nThe plants are often called ''kantong semar'' ([[Semar]]'s pocket) in Indonesia and ''sako ni Hudas'' ([[Judas Iscariot|Judas']] [[Money bag#History|money bag]]) in the Philippines.\n\n===Evolution and phylogeny===\n\nAn absence of evidence of intermediate species, fossil or living (i.e. a [[Transitional fossil|missing link]]), does not allow forming a [[phylogenetic]]al timeline for the development of the distinctive traits of modern ''Nepenthes'', which include its relatively rare strict [[dioecy]] and carnivorous pitchers. Although ''Nepenthes'' is distantly related to several modern genera, among these, even the carnivorous relatives [the sundews (''[[Drosera]]''), Venus flytrap (''[[Dionea muscipula]]''), waterwheel plant (''[[Aldrovanda]]''), and dewy pine (''[[Drosophyllum]]'')], all lack those traits.  Among known ''Nepenthes'', no protomodern characteristics or large variations are found, which suggests that all extant species radiated from a single close ancestor bearing all the modern traits. [[Phylogenetic]] comparisons of the [[chloroplast]] ''[[Maturase K|matK]] ''gene sequences between ''Nepenthes'' species and with related species support this conclusion, long genetic distance between ''Nepenthes'' and others, and abruptly diverging \"pom-pom\" grouping of the ''Nepenthes'' species .<ref name=ICPS_phylogeny>{{cite webpage | last1 = Brittnacher | first1 = John | year = 2011 | title = Evolution -- Nepenthes Phylogeny | url = http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cp/EvolutionNepenthes.php | journal = ICPS Webpage | access-date = 2011-02-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043826/http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cp/EvolutionNepenthes.php | archive-date = 2011-05-14 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFossilized pollen of ''Nepenthes''-like plants living on the northern [[Tethys Sea]] from 65 to 35 million years ago indicates that then-warmer Europe may have been where the proto-''Nepenthes'' developed, and then escaped to Asia and India as Africa collided with Europe and the ensuing climate change wiped out the ancestral species in the original habitat. About 20 million years ago, [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Sulawesi]] and possibly even the Philippines were connected to mainland Asia, providing a bridge for the colonization of most sites of ''Nepenthes'' species radiation. The extensive landbridges in the area 20,000 years ago during the ice age would have provided access to the remaining sites of ''Nepenthes'' populations in [[Oceania]]. The main complication with this hypothesis is the presence of ''Nepenthes'' on the distant islands of [[Seychelles]] and [[Madagascar]]. The seeds were thought to have been transferred by [[seabirds]] and [[shorebirds]], which rest during their migrations in swampy habitats and may have inadvertently picked up the seeds. This hypothesis is possibly reinforced by the success of the lowland swamp-dwelling ''[[Nepenthes distillatoria|N.&nbsp;distillatoria]]'' in colonizing so many locations.<ref name=ICPS_phylogeny />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Nepenthes distribution.svg|thumb|280px|right|Global distribution of ''Nepenthes'']]\n{{further|List of Nepenthes species by distribution|l1=List of ''Nepenthes'' species by distribution}}\n\nThe genus ''Nepenthes'' is mostly found within the [[Malay Archipelago]], with the [[List of Nepenthes species by distribution|greatest biodiversity]] found on Borneo, Sumatra, and the Philippines<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amoroso|first=Victor B.|last2=Aspiras|first2=Reyno A.|date=2011-01-01|title=Hamiguitan Range: A sanctuary for native flora|journal=Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences|volume=18|issue=1|pages=7\u201315|doi=10.1016/j.sjbs.2010.07.003|pmid=23961098|pmc=3730927|issn=1319-562X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nhn/blumea/2009/00000054/f0030001/art00015|title=Inventory and conservation of endangered, endemic and economically important flora of Hamiguitan Range, southern Philippines|last=Amoroso|first=V.

These limited distributions and the inaccessibility of the regions often means  some species go decades without being rediscovered in the wild (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes deaniana|N.&nbsp;deaniana]]'', which was rediscovered 100 years after its initial discovery). About 10 species have population distributions larger than a single island or group of smaller islands. ''Nepenthes mirabilis'' has the distinction of being the most widely distributed species in the genus, ranging from [[Indochina]] and throughout the Malay Archipelago to Australia.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" /><ref name=McPherson>McPherson, S.R. 2009.

Species growing at lower altitudes require continuously warm climates with little difference between day and night temperatures, whereas highland species thrive when they receive warm days and much cooler nights. ''[[Nepenthes lamii]]'' grows at a higher altitude than any other in the genus, up to {{convert|3520|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" /><ref name=\"Jebb and Cheek\" />\n\nMost ''Nepenthes'' species grow in environments that provide high [[humidity]] and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including ''[[Nepenthes ampullaria|N.&nbsp;ampullaria]]'', prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive on the margins of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. ''N.&nbsp;mirabilis'') have been found growing in [[clearcutting|clear-cut]] forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in [[savanna]]-like grass communities. The soils in which ''Nepenthes'' species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of [[peat]], white sand, [[sandstone]], or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] content (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N.&nbsp;rajah]]''), on sandy beaches in the [[sea spray]] zone (e.g. ''[[Nepenthes albomarginata|N.&nbsp;albomarginata]]''). Other species grow on [[inselberg]]s and as [[lithophyte]]s, while others, such as ''[[Nepenthes inermis|N.&nbsp;inermis]]'', can grow as [[epiphyte]]s with no soil contact.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" />\n\n==Ecological relationships==\n[[File:Rajahlizard.jpg|thumb|A drowned lizard found in a freshly opened pitcher of ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N.&nbsp;rajah]]'']]\nThe most obvious interaction between ''Nepenthes'' species and their environments, including other organisms, is that of [[predation|predator and prey]]. ''Nepenthes'' species certainly attract and kill their prey, albeit passively, through active production of attractive colours, sugary [[nectar]], and even sweet scents. From this relationship, the plants primarily gain [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] to supplement their nutrient requirements for growth, given these soil nutrients are typically lacking. The most frequent prey is an abundant and diverse group of [[arthropod]]s, with [[ant]]s and other [[insect]]s topping the menu. Other arthropods found frequently include [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, while [[snail]]s and [[frog]]s are more unusual, but not unheard of. The most uncommon prey for ''Nepenthes'' species includes rats found in ''N.&nbsp;rajah''. The composition of prey captured depends on many factors, including location, but can incorporate hundreds of individual insects and many different species.<ref name=\"Barthlott 2007\" /> While many ''Nepenthes'' species are generalists in what they capture, at least one, ''[[Nepenthes albomarginata|N.&nbsp;albomarginata]]'', has specialised and almost exclusively traps [[termite]]s and produces nearly no nectar. ''Nepenthes albomarginata'' gains its name from the ring of white [[trichome]]s directly beneath the peristome. These trichomes&mdash;or \"hairs\"&mdash;are palatable to termites and will attract them to the pitcher. In the course of collecting the edible trichomes, hundreds or thousands of termites will fall into the pitcher.<ref name=\"Moran 2001\">{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Merbach | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Livingston | first3 = N.J. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = C.M. | last5 = Booth | first5 = W.E. | year = 2001 | title = Termite prey specialization in the pitcher plant ''Nepenthes albomarginata''\u2014evidence from stable isotope analysis | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/88/2/307.pdf | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 88 | issue = 2| pages = 307\u2013311 | doi = 10.1006/anbo.2001.1460 }}</ref><ref name=\"Merbach et al 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Merbach | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Merbach | first2 = D.J. | last3 = Maschwitz | first3 = U. | last4 = Booth | first4 = W.E. | last5 = Fiala | first5 = B. | last6 = Zizka | first6 = G. | year = 2002 | title = Mass march of termites into the deadly trap | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232780033 | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6867| pages = 36\u201337 | doi = 10.1038/415036a | pmid=11780106}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Prey retention by viscoelastic pitcher fluid of ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N.&nbsp;rafflesiana]]''<ref name=viscoelastic_pitcher_fluid />\n|width=200\n|lines=4\n|align=center\n|File:Calliphora vomitoria water escape (ventral).ogv|The blue bottle fly (''[[Calliphora vomitoria]]'') can escape after landing in water on its [[ventral]] surface.\n|File:Calliphora vomitoria water escape (dorsal).ogv|The same is true if the fly falls in [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]]ly (wings-first).\n|File:Calliphora vomitoria in digestive fluid (ventral).ogv|But the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of ''N.&nbsp;rafflesiana'' digestive fluid prevent prey escape, whether the fall is ventral..\n|File:Calliphora vomitoria in digestive fluid (dorsal).ogv|..or dorsal.

The most common infaunal species, often representing the top [[trophic level]] of the infaunal ecosystem, are many species of [[mosquito]] larvae. Other infaunal species include [[fly]] and [[midge]] larvae, spiders, [[mite]]s, ants, and even a species of crab (''[[Geosesarma malayanum]]''). Many of these species specialise to one pitcher plant species and are found nowhere else. These specialists are called [[nepenthebionts]]. Others, often associated with but not dependent on ''Nepenthes'' species, are called nepenthophiles. Nepenthexenes, on the other hand, are rarely found in the pitchers, but will often appear when putrefaction approaches a certain threshold, attracting fly larvae that would normally not be found in the pitcher infaunal community. The complex ecological relationship between pitcher plants and infauna is not yet fully understood, but the relationship may be [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]]: the infauna is given shelter, food, or protection, and the plant that harbours the infauna receives expedited breakdown of captured prey, increasing the rate of digestion and keeping harmful bacterial populations repressed.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997\" /><ref name=\"Mogi 1992\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mogi | first1 = M. | last2 = Yong | first2 = H.S. | year = 1992 | title = Aquatic arthropod communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitchers: the role of niche differentiation, aggregation, predation and competition in community organization | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 90 | issue = 2| pages = 172\u2013184 | doi = 10.1007/BF00317174 | pmid = 28313712 }}</ref><ref name=\"Beaver 1979\">{{cite journal | last1 = Beaver | first1 = R.A. | year = 1979 | title = Fauna and foodwebs of pitcher plants in west Malaysia | url = | journal = Malayan Nature Journal | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1\u201310 }}</ref>\n\n=== Antimicrobial properties ===\n''Nepenthes'' digestive fluids are sterile before pitchers open and contain secondary metabolites and proteins that act as [[bactericide]]s and fungicides after the pitcher opens. While the digestive fluid is being produced, the pitcher is not yet open, so there is no chance of microbial contamination. During pitcher development, at least 29 digestive proteins including [[protease]]s, [[chitinase]]s, [[pathogenesis-related protein]]s and [[thaumatin]]-like proteins are produced in the pitcher fluid. In addition to breaking down prey, these can act as antimicrobial agents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rottloff|first=Sandy|last2=Miguel|first2=Sissi|last3=Biteau|first3=Flore|last4=Nisse|first4=Estelle|last5=Hammann|first5=Philippe|last6=Kuhn|first6=Lauriane|last7=Chicher|first7=Johana|last8=Bazile|first8=Vincent|last9=Gaume|first9=Laurence|date=2016-03-01|title=Proteome analysis of digestive fluids in Nepenthes pitchers|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/3/479|journal=Annals of Botany|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=479\u2013495|doi=10.1093/aob/mcw001|issn=0305-7364|pmc=4765550|pmid=26912512}}</ref> When the pitchers open, the fluid is exposed to bacteria, fungal spores, insects and rain.

In 1658, French colonial governor [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]] published a description of a pitcher plant in his seminal work ''Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar''.  It reads:<ref>de Flacourt, \u00c9. 1658. ''Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar''.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is a plant growing about 3 feet high which carries at the end of its leaves, which are 7 inches long, a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight. There are red ones and yellow ones, the yellow being the biggest. The inhabitants of this country are reluctant to pick the flowers, saying that if somebody does pick them in passing, it will not fail to rain that day. As to that, I and all the other Frenchmen did pick them, but it did not rain. After rain these flowers are full of water, each one containing a good half-glass. [translated from French in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\nFlacourt called the plant ''Amramatico'', after a local name. More than a century later, this species was [[Species description|formally described]] as ''[[Nepenthes madagascariensis|N.&nbsp;madagascariensis]]''.<ref name=Poiret>Poiret, J.L.M. 1797.

''Bandura zingalensium'' etc. ''Prodromus Fasciculi Rariorum Plantarum'' 1: 18.</ref> ''Bandura'' subsequently became the most commonly used name for the tropical pitcher plants, until Linnaeus coined ''Nepenthes'' in 1737.<ref name=P&L />\n\n''Nepenthes distillatoria'' was again described in 1683, this time by Swedish physician and naturalist [[Herman Niklas Grim]]<!--also known as Hermann Nicolaus Grimm, Hermannus Nicolaus Grimmius-->.<ref>Grimm, H.N. 1683.

The second, referred to as ''Cantharifera&nbsp;alba'', is thought to have been ''[[Nepenthes maxima|N.&nbsp;maxima]]''. Rumphius described the plants in his most famous work, the six-volume ''Herbarium Amboinense'', a catalogue of the [[flora]] of [[Ambon Island]]. However, it would not be published until many years after his death.<ref>Rumphius, G.E. 1741\u20131750. ''Cantharifera''.

In 1687, with the project nearing completion, at least half of the illustrations were lost in a fire. Persevering, Rumphius and his helpers first completed the book in 1690. However, two years later, the ship carrying the manuscript to the Netherlands was attacked and sunk by the French, forcing them to start over from a copy that had fortunately been retained by Governor-General Johannes Camphuijs. The ''Herbarium Amboinensis'' finally arrived in the Netherlands in 1696. Even then, the first volume did not appear until 1741, 39 years after Rumphius's death. By this time, Linnaeus's name ''Nepenthes'' had become established.<ref name=P&L />\n\n[[File:Nepenthes distillatoria - Thesaurus zeylanicus (1737).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of ''Bandura&nbsp;zeylanica'' (''N.&nbsp;distillatoria'') from Burmann's ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus'' of 1737]]\n\n''Nepenthes distillatoria'' was again illustrated in [[Johannes Burmann]]'s ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus'' of 1737.

Despite living in the country for around 35 years, it seems unlikely that Loureiro observed living plants of this species, as he stated the lid is a moving part, [[rapid plant movement|actively opening and closing]]. In his most celebrated work, ''Flora Cochinchinensis'', he writes:<ref>de Loureiro, J. 1790. ''Flora Cochinchinensis'' 2: 606\u2013607.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[...] (the) leaf-tip ends in a long hanging tendril, twisted spirally in the middle, from which hangs a sort of vase, oblong, pot-bellied, with a smooth lip with a projecting margin and a lid affixed to one side, which of its own nature freely opens and closes in order to receive the dew and store it. A marvellous work of the Lord! [translated from French in ''[[Pitcher-Plants of Borneo]]'']<ref name=P&L /></blockquote>\n\n''Phyllamphora&nbsp;mirabilis'' was eventually transferred to the genus ''Nepenthes'' by Rafarin in 1869.<ref>Schlauer, J. {{Tooltip| N.d. | No date}} [http://www.omnisterra.com/bot/cp_home.cgi?name=Nepenthes+mirabilis ''Nepenthes mirabilis''].

Poiret described two of the four ''Nepenthes'' species known at the time: ''N.&nbsp;madagascariensis'' and ''N.&nbsp;distillatoria''. He gave the former its current name and called the latter ''Nepente de l'Inde'', or simply \"''Nepenthes'' of India\", although this species is absent from the mainland.  In [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique Botanique'', he included the following account:<ref name=Poiret />\n\n<blockquote>This urn is hollow, as I have just said, usually full of soft, clear water, and then closed. It opens during the day and more than half the liquid disappears, but this loss is repaired during the night, and the next day the urn is full again and closed by its lid.

These four species are highlanders (''N.&nbsp;alata'' has both lowland and highland forms), some easy lowlander species are ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N.&nbsp;rafflesiana]]'', ''[[Nepenthes bicalcarata|N.&nbsp;bicalcarata]]'', ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis|N.&nbsp;mirabilis]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes hirsuta|N.&nbsp;hirsuta]]''.<ref name=\"PietropaoloPietropaolo1986\">{{cite book|author1=James Pietropaolo|author2=Patricia Ann Pietropaolo|title=Carnivorous Plants of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ5IAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-066-6|page=49}}</ref>\n\nHighland forms are those species that grow in habitats generally higher in elevation, and thus exposed to cooler evening temperatures. Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works as long as it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in dissolved solid and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow in full sun), a well-drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as ''N.&nbsp;alata'' can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength. Occasional feeding with frozen (thawed before use) [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s may be beneficial. Terrarium culture of smaller plants, such as ''[[Nepenthes bellii|N.&nbsp;bellii]]'', [[Nepenthes \u00d7 trichocarpa|''N.''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''trichocarpa'']] and ''[[Nepenthes ampullaria|N.&nbsp;ampullaria]]'', is possible, but most plants will get too large over time.<ref name=\"D'Amato2013\">{{cite book|author=Peter D'Amato|title=The Savage Garden, Revised: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOA2pFHQG4AC&pg=PT89|date=2 July 2013|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=978-1-60774-411-5|page=89}}</ref><ref name=\"Rice2006\">{{cite book|author=Barry A.

Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped ''[[Sphagnum]]'' [[moss]], or on sterile plant tissue culture media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or [[perlite]] has been used for germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp ''Sphagnum'' moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. [[Plant tissue culture|Tissue culture]] is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices. ''Nepenthes'' species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of them are listed in [[CITES]] appendices 2, with the exception of ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N. rajah]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes khasiana|N. khasiana]]'' which are listed in CITES appendix 1.<ref name=\"D'Amato2013\"/>{{rp|353}}\n\n==Hybrids and cultivars==\n[[File:VentricosaXtrusmadensis-1.jpg|thumb|200px|The complex man-made hybrid ''N.&nbsp;ventricosa'' \u00d7 (''N.&nbsp;lowii'' \u00d7 ''N.&nbsp;macrophylla'')]]\n{{See also|List of Nepenthes natural hybrids|List of Nepenthes cultivars}}\nThere are many [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] ''Nepenthes'' and numerous named [[cultivar]]s.

Woolworth Company|F.W. Woolworth]] name (the owner of the Woolworth's chain in the United States and United Kingdom). Moreover, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in [[New South Wales]]. Accordingly, Woolworths Ltd in Australia has no connection with the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]] in the United States, nor the [[Woolworths Group]] of UK. It also has no connection to the [[Woolworths (South Africa)|Woolworths Group in South Africa]].\n\nThe new Woolworths store was innovative; it was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers.\n\nChristmas set up a New Zealand general merchandise operation in Wellington in 1929. Woolworths New Zealand opened its first food store in Auckland in 1956, and supermarkets in 1971. Woolworths New Zealand was sold to the company that is now [[Lion Nathan]] in 1979, then sold to Dairy Farm International in 1990, now owned by [[Progressive Enterprises]], a subsidiary of Foodland Associated Limited of Australia. In 2005 Woolworths Limited and [[Metcash|Metcash Holdings]] agreed to purchase a demerged Foodland, and [[Progressive Enterprises]] and 23 of Foodland's [[Action (supermarket chain)|Action]] supermarkets came under Woolworths' ownership. This acquisition brought total store numbers in Australia to near 750.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in [[Melbourne]] was opened. On 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in [[Adelaide]]. The original Imperial Arcade store was moved to larger premises in Her Majesty's Arcade, a short distance along Pitt Street near the Market Street corner.\n\n[[World War II]] slowed the growth of Woolworths and the Australian and United States military used Woolworths' warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in [[Canberra]] (since closed). At this point Woolworths was still mainly a variety chain and had not moved into the food sector that uses the \"Woolworths\" brand today. This move began in 1955 when it opened its first supermarket at [[Beverly Hills, Sydney|Beverly Hills]], south-west of Sydney. The company bought the Rockmans chain of women's clothing stores in 1960.\n\nIn the 1970s, the company started to open Big W discount department stores and the slow removal of many variety products from the supermarket and variety stores began. This process finished in 1989 when the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed (except the one in [[Rundle Mall]]) and the \"Family Centres\" were split into separate Big W and Woolworths supermarket stores. Woolworths acquired the [[Dick Smith (retailer)|Dick Smith Electronics]] consumer electronics chain in 1981 and expanded the consumer electronics arm of its business with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan Inc in 2001. The company sold the Rockmans chain in 2000, and the Dick Smith Electronics chain in 2012.\n\nIn 1985, the acquisition of the 126 Safeway stores in eastern Australia made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. Safeway stores were in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and included Food Barns in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The stores were acquired following an agreement whereby [[Safeway Stores Inc.|Safeway]] acquired a 19.99% interest in Woolworths Limited. Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets in Victoria traded under the Safeway brand, and Safeway's Food Barns in Queensland and New South Wales became part of Woolworths.\n\nAround this time, the supermarket chain had run eight small supermarket chains including the Queensland-based [[Food For Less]] and the Sydney-based Flemings, both of which survive.\n\nIn 1989, the company was acquired by [[Industrial Equity Limited]], which was in turn one-third owned by The [[Adelaide Steamship Company]], [[David Jones Limited]] and [[Tooth & Co]]. It was a wholly owned subsidiary until 1993, when it was floated in the biggest share sale (at that time) in Australia's history.\n\nIn 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol market, initially with wholly owned \"Plus Petrol\" outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. In 2003, as part of a loyalty program aimed at attracting customers to supermarkets through the lure of four cent a litre discounts, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to co-brand some Caltex outlets as [[Caltex Woolworths]]. These joint venture outlets are supplied with fuel by Caltex and with groceries by Woolworths, and accept Woolworths cards and discount dockets.\n\nIn 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, but was scaled back by 2006. In 2005, the company reached an agreement with the ANZ Banking Group to install ATMs at Woolworths, Big W and Caltex Woolworths locations. Additionally, by 2008, it had invested in financial services infrastructure and expertise, building a team of 50 staff for this purpose.<ref name = \"AFR\">{{cite news| newspaper=Australian Financial Review |title=Retailers take on the banks\u2026again| date=30 January 2008|pages=1, 61| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Woolworths opened its first Metro convenience store, in [[Sydney]], converting their premier multi-level variety store for 32 years to this format with the lower ground floor specialising in a large range of \u2018prepared meals\u2019 to cater for the increasing numbers of city dwellers. Known for its rainbow branding with the slogan \"Fine food without the fuss\", subsequent stores were opened in [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]], [[Boronia Park]], [[West Pennant Hills]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] and its flagship Town Hall store in Sydney and [[Ascot, Queensland|Ascot]] in [[Brisbane]]. Currently the \"Woolworths Metro\" brand is used for smaller format convenience stores in the major cities and towns across Australia.\n\nWoolworths started to expand into liquor businesses with the acquisition of [[Dan Murphy's]] in 1998. By 2001, the [[Beer Wine Spirits|BWS]] chain had been established. With [[Queensland]] licensing laws dictating that retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2005 in a joint venture with experienced hotel operator Bruce Mathieson, purchasing hotelier Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH). Later in 2005 the ALH Group expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group and the Bruce Mathieson Group. The ALH Group is 25% owned by Bruce Mathieson and 75% owned by Woolworths. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one third of sales are made up of gaming/poker machine takings.<ref>[http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf Woolworths Limited taverners analyst presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104051935/http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf |date=4 January 2007 }}</ref> The number of poker machines owned by Woolworths and Bruce Mathieson after ALH acquisitions was 10,722.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/retail-giants-place-side-bet-on-pokies/2006/03/28/1143441151233.html \"Retail Giants Place Side Bet on Pokies\"], theage.com.au, 28 March 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the company had three major events: \n*in June it opened a buying office in Hong Kong to cut out the intermediary in sourcing foreign-produced items;\n*it announced a venture with the Tata Group in India to introduce Dick Smiths Electronics stores to that country;\n*in September it announced that it had taken a 10% strategic stake in [[The Warehouse Group]] in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2006, Woolworths rolled out new [[Retalix]] [[point of sale]] systems running on [[IBM]] POS hardware with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] touchscreens throughout all its stores.<ref>{{cite web|title= Australia's Woolworths Meets Store Service Strategy with Retalix StoreLine|accessdate=14 October 2007|publisher=Internet Retailer|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/internet/marketing-conference/66458-australias-woolworths-meets-store-service-strategy-retalix-storeline.html}}</ref> These self-serve checkouts were initially trialled in [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]], NSW.\n\nIn August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title= Now it's Woolworths the credit card people|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=6 September 2007|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/now-its-woolworths-the-credit-card-people/2007/08/27/1188067034518.html}}</ref>  It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network.<ref name = \"AFR\"/> [[HSBC]] was subsequently named as its credit card partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolies way ahead at checkout |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2008 |publisher=Melbourne Herald Sun |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229040918/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |archivedate=29 February 2008 }}</ref> Woolworths subsequently announced that the ''Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard'' would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers.<ref>{{cite news|work=news.com.au|title=Woolworths launches new credit card|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24199187-462,00.html|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Financial Informer|title=Woolies MasterCard debut|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=1 January 2015|url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/woolies-mastercard-debut/}}</ref> It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|title=Woolies makes move into credit cards|date=19 August 2008|page=13|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nInto 2008, a ''Wake Up Woolworths'' campaign, largely funded by the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]], was pushing Woolworths to sever its relationship with [[Asia Pulp & Paper]] over claims of deforestation of Indonesian rainforests.

One of the foundation investors was [[Preston Lanchester Gowing]], the then chairman of [[Gowings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esvc000089.wic034u.server-web.com/downloads/2002%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=GOW372_Annual(pg1-14) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott Waine was \"Wallworths Bazaar\" \u2013 a play on the [[F.W. Woolworth Company|F.W. Woolworth]] name (the owner of the Woolworth's chain in the United States and United Kingdom). Moreover, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in [[New South Wales]]. Accordingly, Woolworths Ltd in Australia has no connection with the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]] in the United States, nor the [[Woolworths Group]] of UK. It also has no connection to the [[Woolworths (South Africa)|Woolworths Group in South Africa]].\n\nThe new Woolworths store was innovative; it was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers.\n\nChristmas set up a New Zealand general merchandise operation in Wellington in 1929. Woolworths New Zealand opened its first food store in Auckland in 1956, and supermarkets in 1971. Woolworths New Zealand was sold to the company that is now [[Lion Nathan]] in 1979, then sold to Dairy Farm International in 1990, now owned by [[Progressive Enterprises]], a subsidiary of Foodland Associated Limited of Australia. In 2005 Woolworths Limited and [[Metcash|Metcash Holdings]] agreed to purchase a demerged Foodland, and [[Progressive Enterprises]] and 23 of Foodland's [[Action (supermarket chain)|Action]] supermarkets came under Woolworths' ownership. This acquisition brought total store numbers in Australia to near 750.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in [[Melbourne]] was opened. On 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in [[Adelaide]]. The original Imperial Arcade store was moved to larger premises in Her Majesty's Arcade, a short distance along Pitt Street near the Market Street corner.\n\n[[World War II]] slowed the growth of Woolworths and the Australian and United States military used Woolworths' warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in [[Canberra]] (since closed). At this point Woolworths was still mainly a variety chain and had not moved into the food sector that uses the \"Woolworths\" brand today. This move began in 1955 when it opened its first supermarket at [[Beverly Hills, Sydney|Beverly Hills]], south-west of Sydney. The company bought the Rockmans chain of women's clothing stores in 1960.\n\nIn the 1970s, the company started to open Big W discount department stores and the slow removal of many variety products from the supermarket and variety stores began. This process finished in 1989 when the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed (except the one in [[Rundle Mall]]) and the \"Family Centres\" were split into separate Big W and Woolworths supermarket stores. Woolworths acquired the [[Dick Smith (retailer)|Dick Smith Electronics]] consumer electronics chain in 1981 and expanded the consumer electronics arm of its business with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan Inc in 2001. The company sold the Rockmans chain in 2000, and the Dick Smith Electronics chain in 2012.\n\nIn 1985, the acquisition of the 126 Safeway stores in eastern Australia made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. Safeway stores were in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and included Food Barns in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The stores were acquired following an agreement whereby [[Safeway Stores Inc.|Safeway]] acquired a 19.99% interest in Woolworths Limited. Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets in Victoria traded under the Safeway brand, and Safeway's Food Barns in Queensland and New South Wales became part of Woolworths.\n\nAround this time, the supermarket chain had run eight small supermarket chains including the Queensland-based [[Food For Less]] and the Sydney-based Flemings, both of which survive.\n\nIn 1989, the company was acquired by [[Industrial Equity Limited]], which was in turn one-third owned by The [[Adelaide Steamship Company]], [[David Jones Limited]] and [[Tooth & Co]]. It was a wholly owned subsidiary until 1993, when it was floated in the biggest share sale (at that time) in Australia's history.\n\nIn 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol market, initially with wholly owned \"Plus Petrol\" outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. In 2003, as part of a loyalty program aimed at attracting customers to supermarkets through the lure of four cent a litre discounts, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to co-brand some Caltex outlets as [[Caltex Woolworths]]. These joint venture outlets are supplied with fuel by Caltex and with groceries by Woolworths, and accept Woolworths cards and discount dockets.\n\nIn 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, but was scaled back by 2006. In 2005, the company reached an agreement with the ANZ Banking Group to install ATMs at Woolworths, Big W and Caltex Woolworths locations. Additionally, by 2008, it had invested in financial services infrastructure and expertise, building a team of 50 staff for this purpose.<ref name = \"AFR\">{{cite news| newspaper=Australian Financial Review |title=Retailers take on the banks\u2026again| date=30 January 2008|pages=1, 61| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Woolworths opened its first Metro convenience store, in [[Sydney]], converting their premier multi-level variety store for 32 years to this format with the lower ground floor specialising in a large range of \u2018prepared meals\u2019 to cater for the increasing numbers of city dwellers. Known for its rainbow branding with the slogan \"Fine food without the fuss\", subsequent stores were opened in [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]], [[Boronia Park]], [[West Pennant Hills]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] and its flagship Town Hall store in Sydney and [[Ascot, Queensland|Ascot]] in [[Brisbane]]. Currently the \"Woolworths Metro\" brand is used for smaller format convenience stores in the major cities and towns across Australia.\n\nWoolworths started to expand into liquor businesses with the acquisition of [[Dan Murphy's]] in 1998. By 2001, the [[Beer Wine Spirits|BWS]] chain had been established. With [[Queensland]] licensing laws dictating that retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2005 in a joint venture with experienced hotel operator Bruce Mathieson, purchasing hotelier Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH). Later in 2005 the ALH Group expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group and the Bruce Mathieson Group. The ALH Group is 25% owned by Bruce Mathieson and 75% owned by Woolworths. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one third of sales are made up of gaming/poker machine takings.<ref>[http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf Woolworths Limited taverners analyst presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104051935/http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf |date=4 January 2007 }}</ref> The number of poker machines owned by Woolworths and Bruce Mathieson after ALH acquisitions was 10,722.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/retail-giants-place-side-bet-on-pokies/2006/03/28/1143441151233.html \"Retail Giants Place Side Bet on Pokies\"], theage.com.au, 28 March 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the company had three major events: \n*in June it opened a buying office in Hong Kong to cut out the intermediary in sourcing foreign-produced items;\n*it announced a venture with the Tata Group in India to introduce Dick Smiths Electronics stores to that country;\n*in September it announced that it had taken a 10% strategic stake in [[The Warehouse Group]] in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2006, Woolworths rolled out new [[Retalix]] [[point of sale]] systems running on [[IBM]] POS hardware with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] touchscreens throughout all its stores.<ref>{{cite web|title= Australia's Woolworths Meets Store Service Strategy with Retalix StoreLine|accessdate=14 October 2007|publisher=Internet Retailer|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/internet/marketing-conference/66458-australias-woolworths-meets-store-service-strategy-retalix-storeline.html}}</ref> These self-serve checkouts were initially trialled in [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]], NSW.\n\nIn August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title= Now it's Woolworths the credit card people|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=6 September 2007|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/now-its-woolworths-the-credit-card-people/2007/08/27/1188067034518.html}}</ref>  It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network.<ref name = \"AFR\"/> [[HSBC]] was subsequently named as its credit card partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolies way ahead at checkout |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2008 |publisher=Melbourne Herald Sun |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229040918/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |archivedate=29 February 2008 }}</ref> Woolworths subsequently announced that the ''Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard'' would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers.<ref>{{cite news|work=news.com.au|title=Woolworths launches new credit card|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24199187-462,00.html|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Financial Informer|title=Woolies MasterCard debut|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=1 January 2015|url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/woolies-mastercard-debut/}}</ref> It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|title=Woolies makes move into credit cards|date=19 August 2008|page=13|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nInto 2008, a ''Wake Up Woolworths'' campaign, largely funded by the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]], was pushing Woolworths to sever its relationship with [[Asia Pulp & Paper]] over claims of deforestation of Indonesian rainforests.

Following the failure of her bakery due to the [[Great Recession|recession]], her boyfriend left her, and she lost her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a [[jewelry store]] and share an apartment with an English immigrant roommate Gil and his sister Brynn. Her business failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. Annie has a [[casual sex|no-strings-attached]] sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted, but she hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian, is virtually her only source of happiness.\n\nLillian becomes engaged to her boyfriend Doug and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the [[engagement party]], Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: cynical, worldly, long-married cousin Rita; na\u00efve and idealistic newlywed friend from work Becca; the groom's decidedly unfiltered sister Megan; and Helen, the rich, beautiful, and elite wife of the groom's boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.\n\nAnnie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a [[Churrascaria|Brazilian steak restaurant]] in Chicago for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. Helen uses her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didn't make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole party\u2014with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting\u2014 gets [[diarrhea]] from [[food poisoning]]. Later, Annie's suggestion of a [[bachelorette party]] at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to [[Las Vegas]] planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in economy class although the rest of the party flies [[First class (aviation)|first-class]]. The trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative and liquor from Helen because of her massive [[fear of flying]] and begins to hallucinate. The plane makes an [[emergency landing]] in [[Casper, Wyoming]], and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides that she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and the wedding.\n\nAnnie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but Irish-American Nathan Rhodes, a friendly [[Wisconsin State Patrol|State Patrol]] officer who had earlier let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights, begins flirting with her. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie declines. Following a romantic night together, Nathan buys baking supplies as a surprise, in the hopes that Annie will start baking again. Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired for being rude to a customer, and kicked out of her apartment by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother.\n\nAnnie travels to Helen's home in Chicago for the [[bridal shower]], which has become a Parisian-themed event, an idea that Annie previously came up with but Helen turned down. Helen also upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Helen stole from Annie. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme and jealous of her relationship with Lillian, Annie throws a tantrum. Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident due to her still-broken tail lights, but the other driver flees the scene. Officer Rhodes ends up being the responding officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights or taking responsibility for her life. When Annie dismisses him by saying she \"knows\" he didn't want anything but sex from her, Rhodes is upset, and storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride. On the ride home, Ted asks Annie to perform [[oral sex]] on him. Frustrated, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.\n\nAnnie becomes [[recluse|reclusive]], refusing to leave her mother's house and obsessively watching television. Eventually, Megan arrives and gives Annie a pep talk, telling her that she must stop blaming the world for her problems and take control of her life. Annie realizes her errors and begins to repair her life, beginning to bake again and getting her car fixed. She tries to make amends with Nathan, but he is still upset over her previous actions and ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her. While they drive, Helen apologizes to Annie and opens up to her, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true female friends, leading to something of a reconciliation between them. The two enlist Officer Rhodes to help, and he reluctantly agrees. The group finds Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding because of Helen's extravagant planning and from fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.\n\nAnnie resumes her place as maid of honor. After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is \"perfect\", Helen again apologizes to Annie, and states her hope that they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Officer Rhodes were falling in love, Helen also arranged for him to pick up Annie after the wedding. Officer Rhodes and Annie reconcile and the pair ride away in his police car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 168\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnae [[Kristen Wiig]] and [[Maya Rudolph]] star in the film.\n   | image1    = Kristen Wiig SXSW 2011.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Maya Rudolph.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Annie Walker\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Lillian Donovan\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Helen Harris\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Megan Price\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Rita\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Becca\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Officer Nathan Rhodes\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Judy Walker\n* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] as Gil\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Brynn\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Don\n* [[Tim Heidecker]] as Douglas \"Doug/Dougie\" Price\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Air Marshall Jon\n* Dana Powell as Flight Attendant Claire\n* [[Mitch Silpa]] as Flight Attendant Steve\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Rodney\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Girl at Shower\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Lillian's father\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe cast features brief appearances by several actors who played in the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', including [[Jessica St. Clair]], [[Nancy Carell]], [[Hugh Dane]] and [[Andy Buckley]].\n\nMajor uncredited appearances include: [[Jon Hamm]] as Ted, Annie's sex buddy; [[Grammy Award]]-winning accordionist, pianist, and composer [[Nick Ariondo]] as the accordion player; and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] and Grammy Award winner [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as the old woman in car.\n\nThe film's co-writers, Wiig and [[Annie Mumolo]], appear together when Mumolo plays the credited role of Nervous Woman on Plane, while the film's director, [[Paul Feig]], appears uncredited as one of the wedding guests.

This made it the first Apatow-produced film to be nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400\u2013700 words. -->\nAnnie Walker is a single woman in her mid-thirties, living in [[Milwaukee]]. Following the failure of her [[bakery]] due to the [[Great Recession|recession]], her boyfriend left her, and she lost her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a [[jewelry store]] and share an apartment with an English immigrant roommate Gil and his sister Brynn. Her business failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. Annie has a [[casual sex|no-strings-attached]] sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted, but she hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian, is virtually her only source of happiness.\n\nLillian becomes engaged to her boyfriend Doug and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the [[engagement party]], Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: cynical, worldly, long-married cousin Rita; na\u00efve and idealistic newlywed friend from work Becca; the groom's decidedly unfiltered sister Megan; and Helen, the rich, beautiful, and elite wife of the groom's boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.\n\nAnnie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a [[Churrascaria|Brazilian steak restaurant]] in [[Chicago]] for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. Helen uses her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didn't make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole party\u2014with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting\u2014 gets [[diarrhea]] from [[food poisoning]]. Later, Annie's suggestion of a [[bachelorette party]] at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to [[Las Vegas]] planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in economy class although the rest of the party flies [[First class (aviation)|first-class]]. The trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative and liquor from Helen because of her massive [[fear of flying]] and begins to hallucinate. The plane makes an [[emergency landing]] in [[Casper, Wyoming]], and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides that she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and the wedding.\n\nAnnie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but Irish-American Nathan Rhodes, a friendly [[Wisconsin State Patrol|State Patrol]] officer who had earlier let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights, begins flirting with her. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie declines. Following a romantic night together, Nathan buys baking supplies as a surprise, in the hopes that Annie will start baking again. Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired for being rude to a customer, and kicked out of her apartment by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother.\n\nAnnie travels to Helen's home in Chicago for the [[bridal shower]], which has become a [[Paris]]ian-themed event, an idea that Annie previously came up with but Helen turned down. Helen also upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Helen stole from Annie. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme and jealous of her relationship with Lillian, Annie throws a tantrum. Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident due to her still-broken tail lights, but the other driver flees the scene. Officer Rhodes ends up being the responding officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights or taking responsibility for her life. When Annie dismisses him by saying she \"knows\" he didn't want anything but sex from her, Rhodes is upset, and storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride. On the ride home, Ted asks Annie to perform [[oral sex]] on him. Frustrated, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.\n\nAnnie becomes [[recluse|reclusive]], refusing to leave her mother's house and obsessively watching television. Eventually, Megan arrives and gives Annie a pep talk, telling her that she must stop blaming the world for her problems and take control of her life. Annie realizes her errors and begins to repair her life, beginning to bake again and getting her car fixed. She tries to make amends with Nathan, but he is still upset over her previous actions and ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her. While they drive, Helen apologizes to Annie and opens up to her, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true female friends, leading to something of a reconciliation between them. The two enlist Officer Rhodes to help, and he reluctantly agrees. The group finds Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding because of Helen's extravagant planning and from fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.\n\nAnnie resumes her place as maid of honor. After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is \"perfect\", Helen again apologizes to Annie, and states her hope that they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Officer Rhodes were falling in love, Helen also arranged for him to pick up Annie after the wedding. Officer Rhodes and Annie reconcile and the pair ride away in his police car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 168\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnae [[Kristen Wiig]] and [[Maya Rudolph]] star in the film.\n   | image1    = Kristen Wiig SXSW 2011.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Maya Rudolph.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Annie Walker\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Lillian Donovan\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Helen Harris\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Megan Price\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Rita\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Becca\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Officer Nathan Rhodes\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Judy Walker\n* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] as Gil\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Brynn\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Don\n* [[Tim Heidecker]] as Douglas \"Doug/Dougie\" Price\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Air Marshall Jon\n* Dana Powell as Flight Attendant Claire\n* [[Mitch Silpa]] as Flight Attendant Steve\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Rodney\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Girl at Shower\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Lillian's father\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe cast features brief appearances by several actors who played in the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', including [[Jessica St. Clair]], [[Nancy Carell]], [[Hugh Dane]] and [[Andy Buckley]].\n\nMajor uncredited appearances include: [[Jon Hamm]] as Ted, Annie's sex buddy; [[Grammy Award]]-winning accordionist, pianist, and composer [[Nick Ariondo]] as the accordion player; and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] and Grammy Award winner [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as the old woman in car.\n\nThe film's co-writers, Wiig and [[Annie Mumolo]], appear together when Mumolo plays the credited role of Nervous Woman on Plane, while the film's director, [[Paul Feig]], appears uncredited as one of the wedding guests.
