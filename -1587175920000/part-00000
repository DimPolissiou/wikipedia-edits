The chief elder checked the soil and said that the land was very fertile and but was not appropriate for vegetation (as the known vegetation knowledge for them).

Teyozw\u00fc by a [[Tata Sumo]] taxi. From here one has to climb forty minutes to the top of the mountain. This is where Dz\u00fcko starts but the main valley is still another two hours' walk away. One can exit the valley from the same route but if one is planning to come back by foot, the Jakhama route is shorter.\nAlso it can be reached in five hours of trek from Mt. Temp\u00fc of Senapati district of Manipur. The new five-hour trek route was opened by MMTA (Manipur Mountaineering and Trekking Association).\n\nLamkoi, a leading adventure group in Manipur, organise regular trip to Dzuko Valley every year. Also, there are many [[NGO]]s and adventure tour operators, who organize treks to the Dz\u00fcko Valley. There is a Helipad just next to the Guest house however no service is seen in the last few years.\n\n== Ownership ==\n\nThere has been disputes for years between the two states regarding the ownership of Dzuko Valley with both the states. However, geographically the valley shares both [[Manipur]] and [[Nagaland]] territories despite claims which were demarcated by the British colonial and followed by the government of India upon the division of statehood.\n\n==Landscapes==\n<br/>{{wide image|Dzukou Valley.jpg|1100px|A view of Dzuko Valley from the base camp|align-cap=center}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.solobackpacker.com/dzukou-valley-trek Dzukou Valley Trek]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJlaE7v6F14&t=50s Hues of Dzukou]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dzuko Valley}}\n[[Category:Viswema]]\n[[Category:Valleys of India]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Manipur]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Nagaland]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=December 2018}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Dz\u00fcko Valley\n| photo = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a = Dzuko Valley Guest House.jpg\n| photo1b = Dzuko Valley.jpg\n| photo2a = Dzukou Valley.jpg\n| color = white \n| color_border = white\n| size = 260\n}}\n| photo_caption = (clockwise from top) \nDz\u00fcko Valley guest house\u2014a courtesy of [[Government of Nagaland]]; Dz\u00fcko Valley in Summer; a view of Dzuko Valley from the base camp\n| direction =\n| length = \n| width =\n| elevation = {{convert|2452|m|-2}}\n| coordinates = {{coord|25.553479|N|94.067024|E|display=inline,title}}\n| map = \n| map_size = 200\n| watercourses = [[Dz\u00fcko River]]\n| footnotes = \n}}\n\nThe '''Dz\u00fcko Valley''' is a valley located in borders of the state of [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] in northeast [[India]].

From there the name ''Dz\u00fcko'' came into being, which can also be translated to as ''cold heart''.\n| source = \u2014Oral history\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\nA common misconception is that ''Dz\u00fcko'' derives its meaning from the Angami word which translates to ''Cold Water'' referring to the ice cold stream that flows through the valley.\n\n==Access==\n\nThe main entry is from the foothills of [[Viswema]] village where one can travel to the rest house above Mt. Teyozw\u00fc by a [[Tata Sumo]] taxi. From here one has to climb forty minutes to the top of the mountain. This is where Dz\u00fcko starts but the main valley is still another two hours' walk away. One can exit the valley from the same route but if one is planning to come back by foot, the Jakhama route is shorter.\nAlso it can be reached in five hours of trek from Mt. Temp\u00fc of Senapati district of Manipur. The new five-hour trek route was opened by MMTA (Manipur Mountaineering and Trekking Association).\n\nLamkoi, a leading adventure group in Manipur, organise regular trip to Dzuko Valley every year. Also, there are many [[NGO]]s and adventure tour operators, who organize treks to the Dz\u00fcko Valley. There is a Helipad just next to the Guest house however no service is seen in the last few years.\n\n== Ownership ==\n\nThere has been disputes for years between the two states regarding the ownership of Dzuko Valley with both the states. However, geographically the valley shares both [[Manipur]] and [[Nagaland]] territories despite claims which were demarcated by the British colonial and followed by the government of India upon the division of statehood.\n\n==Landscapes==\n<br/>{{wide image|Dzukou Valley.jpg|1100px|A view of Dzuko Valley from the base camp|align-cap=center}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.solobackpacker.com/dzukou-valley-trek Dzukou Valley Trek]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJlaE7v6F14&t=50s Hues of Dzukou]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dzuko Valley}}\n[[Category:Viswema]]\n[[Category:Valleys of India]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Manipur]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Nagaland]]\n", "name_user": "0blcsp", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dz%C3%BCko_Valley"}

He finished the 2006 season with seven goals and four assists, making him one of Colorado's top offensive players that year.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Beckerman was traded to [[Real Salt Lake]] for [[Mehdi Ballouchy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=6389810&itype=NGPSID&keyword=&qtype=|title=RSL: Trades Ballouchy to Colorado for Beckerman|work=The Salt Lake Tribune}}</ref> Despite joining the team mid-season, he quickly established himself as a team leader for RSL. He took over the captain's armband early in the 2008 season. He started all 38 matches for Salt Lake that year, helping the team reach the Western Conference Final (the club's first-ever playoff appearance). Also in 2008, he was named to the MLS All-Star Inactive List for the second consecutive season.\n\nBeckerman continued as RSL's team captain throughout the 2009 season. During the year, he became the youngest player in MLS history to appear in 200 games. At mid-season, MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]] added Beckerman and teammate [[Javier Morales]] to the roster for the 2009 [[MLS All-Star Game]] played July 29 at RSL's [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]]. RSL struggled through an up-and-down regular season, finishing with a losing record (11\u201312\u20137) and barely qualifying for postseason play. But with Beckerman leading the way, the team completed a stunning sweep through the playoffs, capped with a shootout victory over [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in the 2009 [[MLS Cup]] championship.[[File:Kyle Beckerman MLS AllStar 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Kyle Beckerman, Real Salt Lake Midfielder, warming up at the MLS All Star game at Sporting Park, Kansas City, Kansas on July 31, 2013.]]\n\nOn October 17, 2015 Beckerman broke the record for all-time MLS regular season appearances by a field player, at 379.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyle Beckerman sets MLS record for all-time appearances by a field player|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/10/17/kyle-beckerman-sets-mls-record-all-time-appearances-field-player|website=MLSSoccer.com|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n===International===\nBeckerman has represented the United States on multiple levels of competition. He made his first international appearance in 1997 as a member of the U-16 National Team (in a match against France). He made 40 appearances for the U-17 National Team, starting 36 times and scoring 15 goals. He started all six games in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand, helping the U.S. to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. He also played for the U-23 National Team in the 2004 Pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico.\n\nBeckerman's first appearance for the [[United States men's national soccer team|Senior National Team]] came January 20, 2007 in a friendly match against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. He was named to the U.S. roster for the 2007 [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in Venezuela, where he earned two caps: he entered as a reserve against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], then played the full 90 minutes against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. In July 2009, he was named to the U.S. roster for the [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. He started all six matches for the United States, helping his team to a second-place finish in the tournament. On July 18, 2009 he scored his first international goal in the quarterfinal match against [[Panama national football team|Panama]]. On August 27, 2009, Beckerman was named to the national team roster for two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier matches: against [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (September 5) and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]] (September 9). He entered the match against El Salvador as a second-half substitute.\n\nIn August 2011, Beckerman re-joined the U.S. at the invitation of new coach [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. He played all 90 minutes in a friendly match against Mexico (a 1\u20131 draw) on August 10, and was a halftime substitute in a 1\u20130 friendly loss against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] on September 6. Since that time, Beckerman has been a regular on the national team.\n\nThroughout July 2013, Beckerman was called up for the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] alongside Real Salt Lake teammates [[Nick Rimando]] and [[Tony Beltran]]. Both Beckerman and Rimando started in 5 out of 6 games while Beltran started in only one match in home stadium Rio Tinto Stadium, where the trio played a full 90 minutes in front of their home crowd. Beckerman made 3 assists throughout the tournament until making to the final. On July 28, 2013, Beckerman played a full 90 minutes with Rimando to help secure the United States' 5th Gold Cup championship against Panama in a 1\u20130 victory. It was his first Gold Cup title as well as Rimando's and Beltran's. He was also named the game's Most Valuable Player.\n\nOn May 22, 2014 Beckerman was named to the final 23-man roster for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/05/22/16/35/140522-mnt-roster|title=Klinsmann Names USMNT's 23-Player Roster for 2014 FIFA World Cup|publisher=}}</ref> The tournament was his first-ever World Cup appearance. He started as defensive midfielder in all 3 matches of the group stage, as the U.S. to advance out of the \"[[Group of Death]]\". Klinsmann elected to sit Beckerman in the Round of 16 match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]; the Americans subsequently allowed 18 shots on goal in a 2-1 loss, which eliminated them from the World Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''International appearances and goals''' <ref>{{cite web|title=Beckerman, Kyle|url=http://www.national-football-teams.com/player/20707/Kyle_Beckerman.html|publisher=National-Football-Teams|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! # !!

He played for the United States in the 1999 [[Football U-17 World Championship|Under-17 World Cup]] in New Zealand. He attended [[DeMatha Catholic High School]] in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]] as a freshman, where he won a state wrestling title. He later transferred to and graduated from [[Arundel High School]],<ref name=\"mckeetbs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/high-school/bal-va.alumnireport16oct16,0,1725008.story|title=McKee, Sandra. \"For ex-Arundel star Beckerman, clear path to goal\", ''The Baltimore Sun'', Friday, October 16, 2009.|author=Baltimore Sun|date=October 16, 2009|work=baltimoresun.com}}</ref> and he signed a [[Project-40|Nike Project-40]] contract with MLS on June 27, 2000. Beckerman had been involved with the league for the previous few years, having been one of the inaugural students at the [[United States Soccer Federation]]'s [[Bradenton Academy]], which also featured [[Landon Donovan]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Oguchi Onyewu]], and [[Bobby Convey]].\n\n==Career==\nTwo days after he signed with the league, [[Miami Fusion]] claimed Beckerman. Beckerman hardly played in his first two years; he registered only 110 minutes in his first year and only 14 in his second after breaking his leg playing in the [[USL First Division|A-League]]. He went on loan with [[MLS Project 40]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/aleague/stats/2000/stats.uspstax.html|title=2000 Project 40|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Fusion were contracted at the end of the 2001 season, Beckerman was selected 11th overall in the [[2002 MLS Dispersal Draft]] by the [[Colorado Rapids]]. In his first year with the Rapids, Beckerman again saw limited time, playing 477 minutes and registering one assist. In his second season, he finally broke through, starting 24 games, playing 2124 minutes, and registering five assists as a central midfielder. Beckerman performed at the same level in 2004, starting consistently. Beckerman remained a regular starter through the 2005 and 2006 seasons, playing an increasingly important role for the Rapids. He finished the 2006 season with seven goals and four assists, making him one of Colorado's top offensive players that year.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Beckerman was traded to [[Real Salt Lake]] for [[Mehdi Ballouchy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=6389810&itype=NGPSID&keyword=&qtype=|title=RSL: Trades Ballouchy to Colorado for Beckerman|work=The Salt Lake Tribune}}</ref> Despite joining the team mid-season, he quickly established himself as a team leader for RSL. He took over the captain's armband early in the 2008 season. He started all 38 matches for Salt Lake that year, helping the team reach the Western Conference Final (the club's first-ever playoff appearance). Also in 2008, he was named to the MLS All-Star Inactive List for the second consecutive season.\n\nBeckerman continued as RSL's team captain throughout the 2009 season. During the year, he became the youngest player in MLS history to appear in 200 games. At mid-season, MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]] added Beckerman and teammate [[Javier Morales]] to the roster for the 2009 [[MLS All-Star Game]] played July 29 at RSL's [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]]. RSL struggled through an up-and-down regular season, finishing with a losing record (11\u201312\u20137) and barely qualifying for postseason play. But with Beckerman leading the way, the team completed a stunning sweep through the playoffs, capped with a shootout victory over [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in the 2009 [[MLS Cup]] championship.[[File:Kyle Beckerman MLS AllStar 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Kyle Beckerman, Real Salt Lake Midfielder, warming up at the MLS All Star game at Sporting Park, Kansas City, Kansas on July 31, 2013.]]\n\nOn October 17, 2015 Beckerman broke the record for all-time MLS regular season appearances by a field player, at 379.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyle Beckerman sets MLS record for all-time appearances by a field player|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/10/17/kyle-beckerman-sets-mls-record-all-time-appearances-field-player|website=MLSSoccer.com|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n===International===\nBeckerman has represented the United States on multiple levels of competition. He made his first international appearance in 1997 as a member of the U-16 National Team (in a match against France). He made 40 appearances for the U-17 National Team, starting 36 times and scoring 15 goals. He started all six games in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand, helping the U.S. to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. He also played for the U-23 National Team in the 2004 Pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico.\n\nBeckerman's first appearance for the [[United States men's national soccer team|Senior National Team]] came January 20, 2007 in a friendly match against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. He was named to the U.S. roster for the 2007 [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in Venezuela, where he earned two caps: he entered as a reserve against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], then played the full 90 minutes against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. In July 2009, he was named to the U.S. roster for the [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. He started all six matches for the United States, helping his team to a second-place finish in the tournament. On July 18, 2009 he scored his first international goal in the quarterfinal match against [[Panama national football team|Panama]]. On August 27, 2009, Beckerman was named to the national team roster for two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier matches: against [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (September 5) and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]] (September 9). He entered the match against El Salvador as a second-half substitute.\n\nIn August 2011, Beckerman re-joined the U.S. at the invitation of new coach [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. He played all 90 minutes in a friendly match against Mexico (a 1\u20131 draw) on August 10, and was a halftime substitute in a 1\u20130 friendly loss against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] on September 6. Since that time, Beckerman has been a regular on the national team.\n\nThroughout July 2013, Beckerman was called up for the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] alongside Real Salt Lake teammates [[Nick Rimando]] and [[Tony Beltran]]. Both Beckerman and Rimando started in 5 out of 6 games while Beltran started in only one match in home stadium Rio Tinto Stadium, where the trio played a full 90 minutes in front of their home crowd. Beckerman made 3 assists throughout the tournament until making to the final. On July 28, 2013, Beckerman played a full 90 minutes with Rimando to help secure the United States' 5th Gold Cup championship against Panama in a 1\u20130 victory. It was his first Gold Cup title as well as Rimando's and Beltran's. He was also named the game's Most Valuable Player.\n\nOn May 22, 2014 Beckerman was named to the final 23-man roster for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/05/22/16/35/140522-mnt-roster|title=Klinsmann Names USMNT's 23-Player Roster for 2014 FIFA World Cup|publisher=}}</ref> The tournament was his first-ever World Cup appearance. He started as defensive midfielder in all 3 matches of the group stage, as the U.S. to advance out of the \"[[Group of Death]]\". Klinsmann elected to sit Beckerman in the Round of 16 match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]; the Americans subsequently allowed 18 shots on goal in a 2-1 loss, which eliminated them from the World Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''International appearances and goals''' <ref>{{cite web|title=Beckerman, Kyle|url=http://www.national-football-teams.com/player/20707/Kyle_Beckerman.html|publisher=National-Football-Teams|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! # !!

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].

This process can be automated to download new files automatically, so it may seem to subscribers as though podcasters broadcast or [[Push technology|\"push\"]] new episodes to them.

It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting.

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].
