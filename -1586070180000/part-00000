From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on [[Topcoder]]'s platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018{{r|\"2019 FAQ\"}}, Google also ran Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on [[distributed algorithm]]s.{{r|\"Ghoshal 2015\"}} This was run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000, but was only open for people who qualified to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).\n\nSeveral Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.{{r|\"acm2696032\"}}\n\n== Past winners ==\n=== Google Code Jam ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Gregersen Christensen 2011 p. 196\"}} The competition began in 2003.{{r|\"Lowe 2009 p. 284\"}} The competition consists of a set of [[algorithm]]ic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any [[programming language]] and [[Development environment (software development process)|development environment]] to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on [[Topcoder]]'s platform.

High-end and luxury brands began to develop \"luxury sportswear\", for example [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], Gucci, and [[DKNY]]. Among this type of \"luxury sportswear\", luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like [[silk]] organza, washed [[satin]], [[leather]], [[neoprene]], and [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|wool crepe]] were used to produce the \"luxury sportswear\". These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season.\n\nDetails of the designs in \"luxury sportswear\" looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, \"luxury\" and \"minimalism\" were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences.\n\nCommon mix-and-match combination of \"luxury sportswear\" on streetwear are track pants under [[basketball shorts]], with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; and light colored [[pencil skirt]]s, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, cut in satin or tweed, for women.\n\n=== Seasonal sportswear ===\nSportswear in streetwear designs changes according to season and temperature.\n\nIn winter, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier and volumes are exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as [[fur]], [[velvet]], [[wool]] and leather become predominant, and quilted detailing on [[windbreaker]]s, sporty skirts and vests can be seen. A typical winter look might be a voluminous sweatshirt with satin [[boxer shorts]], or a brocade bomber jacket worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing.\n\nIn summer, the look is usually light-weight and simple, with a combination of [[crop top]]s, sleek dresses, [[Gym shorts|gym-shorts,]] and tank-tops.\n\n=== Hypebeast culture ===\nHypebeast (occasionally \"hype beast\") culture is a colloquial term that at first was considered a derogatory term until Kevin Ma{{clarify|reason=Who is Kevin Ma?|date=April 2020}} coined it for his fashion blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1623507/streetwears-impact-on-fashion-goes-beyond-hoodies-and-t-shirts/|title=Streetwear is what happens to fashion when consumers start dictating the terms|last=Bain|first=Marc|website=Quartzy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even after Ma\u2019s fashion blog expanded to a world-famous website, hypebeast still had a negative connotation behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registerforum.org/3437/news/hypebeast-culture/|title=Hypebeast Culture|last=Weissburg|first=Josie|website=The Register Forum|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even though many hypebeasts will refer to themselves as such, taking it as a term of endearment (much like the evolution of the term [[otaku]] in Japanese popular culture circles) others still believe in the negative connotation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2013/08/evolution-of-the-hypebeast/|title=The Evolution of the Hypebeast: An Illustrated Guide|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nWith a growing trend of prominent brand names and logos on clothing, there has been a development of \"hypebeast culture\" connected to streetwear as of the mid-2000s.

[[Raf Simons]] has made a large impact on streetwear stylings as it has evolved over the years, this might be attributed by the designers influence in hip hop and popular culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nssmag.com/en/fashion/11481/raf-simons|title=Why is streetwear obsessed with Raf Simons?|work=nss magazine|date=June 1, 2017|first=Valerio|last=Coretti}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLryuBCO-M</ref> Other designers such as Demna Gvasalia, creative director of [[Vetements]] and [[Balenciaga]], have also had an impact in recent years championing trends such as the chunky sneaker<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/style/sneakers-balenciaga-triple-s.html|first=Jon|last=Caramanica|date=July 25, 2018|title=My 8-Month Search for $900 Sneakers|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> and the oversized hoodie,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2016/3/2/11139622/what-is-vetements|title=What Is Vetements and Why Is Everyone Freaking Out?|first=Nicola|last=Fumo|date=March 2, 2016|work=[[Racked]]}}</ref> which have slowly become streetwear staples.\n\n=== Luxury Sportswear ===\n[[File:Alexander Wang Photo by Ed Kavishe Fashion Wire Press.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] developed \"luxury sportswear\" in his eponymous brand]]\nThe decline of [[formal wear]] led to the rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands began to develop \"luxury sportswear\", for example [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], Gucci, and [[DKNY]]. Among this type of \"luxury sportswear\", luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like [[silk]] organza, washed [[satin]], [[leather]], [[neoprene]], and [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|wool crepe]] were used to produce the \"luxury sportswear\". These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season.\n\nDetails of the designs in \"luxury sportswear\" looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, \"luxury\" and \"minimalism\" were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences.\n\nCommon mix-and-match combination of \"luxury sportswear\" on streetwear are track pants under [[basketball shorts]], with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; and light colored [[pencil skirt]]s, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, cut in satin or tweed, for women.\n\n=== Seasonal Sportswear ===\nSportswear in streetwear designs changes according to season and temperature.\n\nIn winter, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier and volumes are exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as [[fur]], [[velvet]], [[wool]] and leather become predominant, and quilted detailing on [[windbreaker]]s, sporty skirts and vests can be seen. A typical winter look might be a voluminous sweatshirt with satin [[boxer shorts]], or a brocade bomber jacket worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing.\n\nIn summer, the look is usually light-weight and simple, with a combination of [[crop top]]s, sleek dresses, [[Gym shorts|gym-shorts,]] and tank-tops.\n\n=== Hypebeast Culture ===\nHypebeast (occasionally \"hype beast\") culture is a colloquial term that at first was considered a derogatory term until Kevin Ma{{clarify|reason=Who is Kevin Ma?|date=April 2020}} coined it for his fashion blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1623507/streetwears-impact-on-fashion-goes-beyond-hoodies-and-t-shirts/|title=Streetwear is what happens to fashion when consumers start dictating the terms|last=Bain|first=Marc|website=Quartzy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even after Ma\u2019s fashion blog expanded to a world-famous website, hypebeast still had a negative connotation behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registerforum.org/3437/news/hypebeast-culture/|title=Hypebeast Culture|last=Weissburg|first=Josie|website=The Register Forum|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even though many hypebeasts will refer to themselves as such, taking it as a term of endearment (much like the evolution of the term [[otaku]] in Japanese popular culture circles) others still believe in the negative connotation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2013/08/evolution-of-the-hypebeast/|title=The Evolution of the Hypebeast: An Illustrated Guide|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nWith a growing trend of prominent brand names and logos on clothing, there has been a development of \"hypebeast culture\" connected to streetwear as of the mid-2000s.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings - one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister,<ref name=\"Outsight Radio\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/MunnScott.rm |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Episode #252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004}}</ref> with whom he's had a fraught relationship (as implied in a 2004 interview). <ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio - Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a mild-mannered child growing up.

He also spent time at his family's lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play. <ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref>\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Songwriting, musical themes, and genres===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim. It was re-released on vinyl in 2013 with three additional tracks. Of the three, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \"[[Rufus Wainwright]], I'm Coming After You\".\n\nIn July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in [[Colorado]] by over 100 music experts in the [[Denver Post]] Underground Music Poll. <ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\n===Munly & The Lupercalians===\n\nMunly & The Lupercalians is the second side project of Munly's after The Lee Lewis Harlots.

On stage, each band member wears costumes that designate themselves as members of the fictional town of 'Lupercalia.' \n\nThe goal is to produce a multi-album set with this band, tentatively titled \"The Kinnery Of Lupercalia\", which is all about the town and its colorful residents.

His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim. It was re-released on vinyl in 2013 with three additional tracks. Of the three, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \"[[Rufus Wainwright]], I'm Coming After You\".\n\nIn July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in [[Colorado]] by over 100 music experts in the [[Denver Post]] Underground Music Poll. <ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\n===Munly & The Lupercalians===\n\nMunly & The Lupercalians is the second side project of Munly's after The Lee Lewis Harlots.

built-in schedulers==\n\n* [[Cron]]: Unix built in scheduler\n* [[Systemd]] timers: Most modern Linux distributions\n* [[Windows Task Scheduler]]\n\n==Descriptions of the features==\n\n=== Version ===\nThe information in this table is regarding this product version.\n\n=== Company size ===\n* Large : the company has many products\n* Dedicated : the company's job scheduling product is their primary product\n\n=== Script storage ===\n* Some products are only capable of starting a script or executable which is already present on the target system. Eventually some environment variables are set prior to the script run.\n* Some products are able to store scripts in their repository. When the job runs, its script is first transferred to the target system and then executed. This gives the batch job designer a central point of development.\n\n=== Event driven ===\n* Most modern job schedulers are event driven: jobs that run in sequence have no wait time.\n* The opposite is time driven, like Windows' Scheduled tasks or Unix' crontab: a job runs at some time, and the next job is scheduled the expected runtime later plus some spare time.\n\n=== Agents ===\n* An agentless job scheduler makes use of RSH, or more secure, of SSH.\n* An agent is a piece of software that is installed on every host, and is usually continuously connected to the central job scheduler. This causes more functionality to the agents, like a file trigger.\n* A drawback of agents is that they must be upgraded from time to time, which can cause downtime during upgrades.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAll kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as \"Unix\". The same goes for \"Linux\" and \"Windows\" and Mac.\n\n=== Any OS account ===\nCan the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.\n\n=== stdout/err transfer ===\nCan you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.\n\n=== File events ===\nCan the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.\n\n=== File transfer ===\nSome vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the servers will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.\n\n=== ERP support ===\nThe list of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages supported.\n\n=== SAP XBP version ===\nThe SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.\n\n=== Role-based security ===\nIs it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.\n\n=== Auditing ===\nSome companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.\n\n=== Design lifecycle ===\nDoes the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.\n\n=== User Interfaces ===\nLists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quartz (scheduler)|Quartz]] - open-source job scheduling service, for Java. It exists also as a port to .NET.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Job scheduling|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2018}}\n\nThis is a list of notable '''job scheduler software'''.  [[Job scheduler|Job scheduling applications]] are designed to carry out repetitive tasks as defined in a schedule based upon calendar and event conditions.  This category of software is also called ''workload automation''. Only products with their own article are listed.\n\nThe list is divided into four categories: standalone vendor software\nsupporting [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software,  standalone vendor software without ERP support, non-vendor schedulers, and OS platform built-ins.

This gives the batch job designer a central point of development.\n\n=== Event driven ===\n* Most modern job schedulers are event driven: jobs that run in sequence have no wait time.\n* The opposite is time driven, like Windows' Scheduled tasks or Unix' crontab: a job runs at some time, and the next job is scheduled the expected runtime later plus some spare time.\n\n=== Agents ===\n* An agentless job scheduler makes use of RSH, or more secure, of SSH.\n* An agent is a piece of software that is installed on every host, and is usually continuously connected to the central job scheduler. This causes more functionality to the agents, like a file trigger.\n* A drawback of agents is that they must be upgraded from time to time, which can cause downtime during upgrades.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAll kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as \"Unix\". The same goes for \"Linux\" and \"Windows\" and Mac.\n\n=== Any OS account ===\nCan the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.\n\n=== stdout/err transfer ===\nCan you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.\n\n=== File events ===\nCan the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.\n\n=== File transfer ===\nSome vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the servers will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.\n\n=== ERP support ===\nThe list of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages supported.\n\n=== SAP XBP version ===\nThe SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.\n\n=== Role-based security ===\nIs it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.\n\n=== Auditing ===\nSome companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.\n\n=== Design lifecycle ===\nDoes the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.\n\n=== User Interfaces ===\nLists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quartz (scheduler)|Quartz]] - open-source job scheduling service, for Java. It exists also as a port to .NET.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Job scheduling|*]]\n", "name_user": "Atgenautomation", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJob scheduling products without ERP support", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_job_scheduler_software"}
