It is the 191st largest metropolitan area in the U.S. It is composed of three counties, [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Ford County, Illinois|Ford]], and [[Piatt County, Illinois|Piatt]]. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] has designated the three-county Champaign\u2013Urbana area as one of its [[metropolitan statistical area]]s (the '''Champaign\u2013Urbana, IL MSA'''), which are used for statistical purposes by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] and other agencies.\n\nThe area has a population of 231,891 as determined by the 2010 U.S. Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_NSRD_GCTPL2.US24PR&prodType=table |title=Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 - United States - Metropolitan Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico 2010 Census National Summary File of Redistricting Data |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |work=[[American FactFinder]] |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The area is anchored by the principal cities of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] and is home to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], the flagship campus of the [[University of Illinois system]]. (University students, even those from outside the area, are included in Census figures if they were counted by the federal Census).\n\nJournalists frequently treat the metropolitan area as just one city. For example, in 1998, ''[[Newsweek]]'' included the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area in its list of the top ten tech cities (outside the [[Silicon Valley]]).<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/93757 Newsweek: The Hot New Tech Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803033324/http://www.newsweek.com/id/93757 |date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> Champaign-Urbana also ranked tenth as one of the top twenty-five [[green cities]] in the [[United States]], in a survey made by [[Country Home (magazine)|''Country Home'']] magazine.<ref>[http://www.countryhome.com/greencities/greencities1_100_2007.html CountryHome.com: 2007 Best Green Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220044231/http://www.countryhome.com/greencities/greencities1_100_2007.html |date=February 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Urban core development==\nA number of major developments have significantly changed downtown [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] since the beginning of the 21st century. Beginning in the 1990s, city government began to aggressively court development, including by investing millions of dollars in public funds into downtown improvements and by offering developers incentives, such as liquor licenses, to pursue projects in the area.<ref name=NG2015>{{cite news |title=Downtown: My, how you\u2019ve grown |first=Michael |last=Howie |date=October 25, 2015 |work=The News-Gazette Times|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-10-25/downtown-my-how-youve-grown.html}}</ref> The 9-story M2 on Neil project is such an example.

Burnham 310 connects downtown [[Champaign]] to [[Campustown (Champaign, Illinois)|Campustown]]. In 2013-14, four other mixed-use buildings (apartments above commercial) have been built in Campustown, with heights of 26, 13, 8, and 5 stories. On the [[University of Illinois]] campus, [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] has gone under major renovation, with construction of new stands, clubs, and luxury suites. Across Kirby Avenue, the Assembly Hall, first built in 1963 and renamed the [[State Farm Center]] as part of a major renovation begun in 2014, continues to be the home of Illinois basketball and has resumed hosting concerts and other performing arts after renovation was completed in late 2016. In the late 2000s, the restoration of the Champaign County Courthouse bell tower capped the expansion and renovation of Courthouse facilities and provided a striking focal point in downtown [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. These, among other developments, have given the Twin Cities a more urban feel.\n\n==Outlying areas==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nThe outlying parts of the metropolitan area differ from the suburban areas of many other metropolitan areas. Instead of a sprawling suburban skirt that encircles the urban area, the urban area abuts large swaths of farmland, with small to medium-sized villages that originated as farming communities. But, as the willingness of professionals to commute longer distances has increased in recent decades, new residential developments have arisen on their edges, dotting the surrounding landscape. Some of these villages are home to as many as 5,000 residents or more, but most are significantly smaller.\n\n[[File:East Main Street at Broadway Avenue Urbana, IL sunset.jpg|{{largethumb}}|View of Downtown Urbana]]\nMost of these outlying communities, such as [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]], [[Mahomet, Illinois|Mahomet]], [[St. Joseph, Illinois|St. Joseph]], [[Tolono, Illinois|Tolono]], and arguably [[Rantoul, Illinois|Rantoul]] and [[Monticello, Illinois|Monticello]] as well, are dependent on Champaign and Urbana for economic and infrastructure support. Predominantly, these cities and villages lie in [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]]. These areas are populated to a substantial extent with commuters who work in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] or [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], but reside outside the two cities. Because higher paid professors, doctors and technology professionals who work for the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], the many clinics and hospitals in town, or in the Research Park, are more likely to maintain cars for commuting longer distances and to afford owner-occupied single-family housing, these areas lacking in mass transit and high-density rental projects often have a higher median household income than [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] or [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].\n\nIn addition to residential developments in the surrounding, formerly agricultural communities, residential neighborhoods are also growing up in unincorporated areas within a short radius of the city limits, while the cities themselves are also expanding to annex areas of new development. While the annexed areas benefit from municipal services, developments that are willing to forego city sewer systems, libraries and police protection can enjoy the lower tax rates the surrounding townships levy, as fewer services are provided. Areas currently under construction extend as far as around Rising Road west of [[I-57]] and north and east of [[Willard Airport]]. Some of this land is in [[Champaign Township, Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign Township]], while some has been annexed to either [[Champaign]] or [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]]. Additional [[land development]] is occurring north of [[I-74]] in land annexed by both [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. On the eastern side of the city of [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], new business developments such as a [[Meijer]], a planned [[Menards]], and a commercial center with many restaurants and services have broken ground, as well as more suburban housing.\n\nThe issue of land development is often hotly contested by local governments. In addition to arguments for and against development, the question of potential annexations, which remove property tax revenues from the surrounding townships while increasing the urban tax base (but also the demands on urban services) is a point of constant strife between the cities and the surrounding townships. On the other hand, the availability of higher-valued housing in areas belonging to the townships or surrounding villages, which is paid for by workers earning their money within the urban infrastructure also represents a movement of potential tax dollars from [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] to their dependent areas.\n\n==Tourism and recreation==\n\n===Museums===\n*[[Champaign County Historical Museum]].<ref>[http://www.champaignmuseum.org/ champaignmuseum.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105094655/http://www.champaignmuseum.org/ |date=November 5, 2014 }}</ref>  Located in the Historic Cattle Bank built in 1858.

The [[Carle Foundation Hospital]], and [[OSF HealthCare|OSF Heart of Mary Medical Center]], with a combined total of over 550 [[physicians]]. Both hospitals provide various specialized services, and Carle Hospital currently has a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a Level I Trauma Center, and a medical helicopter service. Both hospitals have struggled to maintain their [[tax-exempt]] status with the [[State of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/living/2007-02-27/state-removes-carles-property-tax-exemption.html|title=State removes Carle's property tax exemption|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nCarle Clinic Association was purchased by the Carle Foundation in 2010.

Christie Clinic, another smaller multi-specialty group practice, is headquartered in downtown [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]. They are largely affiliated with OSF, but not as closely linked as their Carle counterparts are.\n\nBoth hospitals and clinics are affiliated with the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana, part of the larger University of Illinois College of Medicine, which has campuses in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. The College has a teaching presence at both hospitals, although the facilities are somewhat more extensive at Carle Foundation Hospital.\n\nPiatt County, which is included in the Champaign-Urbana Metro Area, also has a hospital. Kirby Medical Center is a general medical and surgical facility located in Monticello. Both Carle Clinic and Christie Clinic have satellite facilities located at Kirby.\n\n==Arts and culture==\n[[Image:vatheatre1010054.JPG|{{largethumb}}|The Virginia Theatre in Downtown Champaign.]]\n\nThe Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area is home to many theatres. The [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University]] is home to three theatre venues; [[Foellinger Auditorium]], [[Assembly Hall (Champaign)|Assembly Hall]] and the [[Krannert Center for the Performing Arts]]. While the Assembly Hall is primarily a campus basketball and concert arena, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts is considered to be one of the nation's top venues for performance and hosts over 400 performances annually. Built in 1969, the Krannert Center's facilities cover over four acres (16,000 m\u00b2) of land, and features four theatres and an amphitheatre.\n\n[[Virginia Theatre (Champaign)|The Historic Virginia Theatre]] in downtown Champaign is a public venue owned by the city of Champaign and administered by the [[Champaign Park District]]. It is best known for hosting [[Roger Ebert]]'s [[Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival|Film Festival]] which occurs annually during the last week of April. The Virginia also features a variety of performances from community theatre with the [[Champaign Urbana Theatre Company]], to post box-office showings of popular films, current artistic films, live musical performances (both orchestral and popular), and other types of shows. First commissioned in 1921, it originally served as a venue for both film and live performances, but became primarily a movie house in the 1950s. Occasional live events were held during the 1970s and 1980s, including a live production of \"Oh, Calcutta\" and performances by [[George Benson]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]], and the [[Indigo Girls]]. GKC Corporation closed the Virginia as a movie house on February 13, 1992, with the final regular film being [[Steve Martin]]'s \"Father of the Bride\". The theatre once again began holding regular live performances when it was leased to local gospel singer David Wyper in 1992. The [[Champaign-Urbana Theatre Company]] was formed to perform major musicals and opened their first season with \"The Music Man\" that June. Control passed to the Virginia Theatre group in 1996 and the theatre became a non-profit public venue. The [[Champaign Park District]] assumed control of the facilities in 2000. Its original Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ<ref>[http://www.theatreorgans.com/il/champaign/ Virginia Theatre Wurlitzer]. Theatreorgans.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.</ref> has been maintained by Warren York since 1988 and is still played regularly.\n\nThe Art Theater<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecuart.com/|title=\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u30d4\u30eb\u3067\u907f\u598a\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044|website=thecuart.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> in downtown Champaign began as Champaign's first theatre devoted to movies, the Park, in 1913, and was a small venue showing films not normally playing at the box office. The theatre was the only single-screen movie theatre with daily operation as a movie theatre in Champaign-Urbana. The theater ceased operations on October 31 of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearttheater.org/thankyou/|title=Thank you, Art patrons|website=thearttheater.org/|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref> The Virginia, which hosts Roger Ebert's Annual Overlooked Film Festival, is also single-screen, but only opens for special showings and events.

Staerkel Planetarium.\n\nThe area has originated a great deal of musical talent, starting with [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Head East]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and including [[Hum (band)|HUM]], [[Poster Children]], [[Hardvark]], [[The Moon Seven Times]], [[Braid]], [[AMASONG]], [[Castor (band)|Castor]], [[National Skyline]], [[Love Cup (band)|Love Cup]], [[Absinthe Blind]],[[Headlights (band)|Headlights]] and [[The Beauty Shop (band)|The Beauty Shop]]. Some lesser known artists like [[Alma Afrobeat Ensemble]], [[Zirafa]] and [[Spinnerty]], d-Lo, Bozak, Melodic Scribes, DJ Librarian, [[UC Hiphop]], and [[Zmick]] are also worthy of note on simply a local scale. Champaign-Urbana is relatively well known for producing a rich array of emo, college rock, and black metal.\n\nOpening in 1990 in the heart of downtown Champaign, the Blind Pig Co on Taylor St was one of the first businesses to lead the renaissance of the formerly deserted downtown district. The Blind Pig catered to the budding music community, and indeed fostered many of the local bands. Live music was featured 5 nights a week, and grunge and indy rock bands like the Afghan Whigs, Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair, Pavement and Everclear performed there on numerous occasions. Blues legends like Luther Allison, Ronnie and Lonnie Brooks, Otis Clay and Robert Cotton were also featured, as were international acts like I.K. Dairo, Diblo Diballa, the Five Blind Boys, Malathini and the Mohatella Queens, and Tabuley Rochereau.\n\nThe Blind Pig closed as a music venue in 1998, but re-opened as a craft beer bar in 2004, and a microbrewery in 2009.\n\nThe cities now host [[Pygmalion Music Festival]] on an annual basis, presented by the [[Nicodemus Agency]] and [[Krannert Center for the Performing Arts]]. Past performers include [[Iron and Wine]], [[The Books]], [[Yacht (band)|Yacht]], [[Rjd2]], [[Yo La Tengo]], [[Black Mountain (band)|Black Mountain]], [[Asobi Seksu]], [[Times New Viking]], [[of Montreal]], [[Danielson]], [[Man Man]], [[Okkervil River (band)|Okkervil River]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Questlove]], and more. The 2010 festival took place September 22\u201325.\n\nThe twin cities have a large number and variety of restaurants from long-standing breakfast and pizza traditions to newer, high-end dinner spots with \"Chicago-style\" aspirations.

'''Champaign\u2013Urbana''' and '''Urbana\u2013Champaign''' as well as '''Chambana''' (colloquially), is a [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] in east-central [[Illinois]]. It is the 191st largest metropolitan area in the U.S. It is composed of three counties, [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Ford County, Illinois|Ford]], and [[Piatt County, Illinois|Piatt]]. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] has designated the three-county Champaign\u2013Urbana area as one of its [[metropolitan statistical area]]s (the '''Champaign\u2013Urbana, IL MSA'''), which are used for statistical purposes by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] and other agencies.\n\nThe area has a population of 231,891 as determined by the 2010 U.S. Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_NSRD_GCTPL2.US24PR&prodType=table |title=Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 - United States - Metropolitan Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico 2010 Census National Summary File of Redistricting Data |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |work=[[American FactFinder]] |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The area is anchored by the principal cities of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] and is home to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], the flagship campus of the [[University of Illinois system]]. (University students, even those from outside the area, are included in Census figures if they were counted by the federal Census).\n\nJournalists frequently treat the metropolitan area as just one city. For example, in 1998, ''[[Newsweek]]'' included the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area in its list of the top ten tech cities (outside the [[Silicon Valley]]).<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/93757 Newsweek: The Hot New Tech Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803033324/http://www.newsweek.com/id/93757 |date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> Champaign-Urbana also ranked tenth as one of the top twenty-five [[green cities]] in the [[United States]], in a survey made by [[Country Home (magazine)|''Country Home'']] magazine.<ref>[http://www.countryhome.com/greencities/greencities1_100_2007.html CountryHome.com: 2007 Best Green Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220044231/http://www.countryhome.com/greencities/greencities1_100_2007.html |date=February 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Urban core development==\nA number of major developments have significantly changed downtown [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] since the beginning of the 21st century. Beginning in the 1990s, city government began to aggressively court development, including by investing millions of dollars in public funds into downtown improvements and by offering developers incentives, such as liquor licenses, to pursue projects in the area.<ref name=NG2015>{{cite news |title=Downtown: My, how you\u2019ve grown |first=Michael |last=Howie |date=October 25, 2015 |work=The News-Gazette Times|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-10-25/downtown-my-how-youve-grown.html}}</ref> The 9-story M2 on Neil project is such an example.

Burnham 310 connects downtown [[Champaign]] to [[Campustown (Champaign, Illinois)|Campustown]]. In 2013-14, four other mixed-use buildings (apartments above commercial) have been built in Campustown, with heights of 26, 13, 8, and 5 stories. On the [[University of Illinois]] campus, [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] has gone under major renovation, with construction of new stands, clubs, and luxury suites. Across Kirby Avenue, the Assembly Hall, first built in 1963 and renamed the [[State Farm Center]] as part of a major renovation begun in 2014, continues to be the home of Illinois basketball and has resumed hosting concerts and other performing arts after renovation was completed in late 2016. In the late 2000s, the restoration of the Champaign County Courthouse bell tower capped the expansion and renovation of Courthouse facilities and provided a striking focal point in downtown [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. These, among other developments, have given the Twin Cities a more urban feel.\n\n==Outlying areas==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nThe outlying parts of the metropolitan area differ from the suburban areas of many other metropolitan areas. Instead of a sprawling suburban skirt that encircles the urban area, the urban area abuts large swaths of farmland, with small to medium-sized villages that originated as farming communities. But, as the willingness of professionals to commute longer distances has increased in recent decades, new residential developments have arisen on their edges, dotting the surrounding landscape. Some of these villages are home to as many as 5,000 residents or more, but most are significantly smaller.\n\n[[File:East Main Street at Broadway Avenue Urbana, IL sunset.jpg|{{largethumb}}|View of Downtown Urbana]]\nMost of these outlying communities, such as [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]], [[Mahomet, Illinois|Mahomet]], [[St. Joseph, Illinois|St. Joseph]], [[Tolono, Illinois|Tolono]], and arguably [[Rantoul, Illinois|Rantoul]] and [[Monticello, Illinois|Monticello]] as well, are dependent on Champaign and Urbana for economic and infrastructure support. Predominantly, these cities and villages lie in [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]]. These areas are populated to a substantial extent with commuters who work in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] or [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], but reside outside the two cities. Because higher paid professors, doctors and technology professionals who work for the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], the many clinics and hospitals in town, or in the Research Park, are more likely to maintain cars for commuting longer distances and to afford owner-occupied single-family housing, these areas lacking in mass transit and high-density rental projects often have a higher median household income than [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] or [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].\n\nIn addition to residential developments in the surrounding, formerly agricultural communities, residential neighborhoods are also growing up in unincorporated areas within a short radius of the city limits, while the cities themselves are also expanding to annex areas of new development. While the annexed areas benefit from municipal services, developments that are willing to forego city sewer systems, libraries and police protection can enjoy the lower tax rates the surrounding townships levy, as fewer services are provided. Areas currently under construction extend as far as around Rising Road west of [[I-57]] and north and east of [[Willard Airport]]. Some of this land is in [[Champaign Township, Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign Township]], while some has been annexed to either [[Champaign]] or [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]]. Additional [[land development]] is occurring north of [[I-74]] in land annexed by both [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. On the eastern side of the city of [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], new business developments such as a [[Meijer]], a planned [[Menards]], and a commercial center with many restaurants and services have broken ground, as well as more suburban housing.\n\nThe issue of land development is often hotly contested by local governments. In addition to arguments for and against development, the question of potential annexations, which remove property tax revenues from the surrounding townships while increasing the urban tax base (but also the demands on urban services) is a point of constant strife between the cities and the surrounding townships. On the other hand, the availability of higher-valued housing in areas belonging to the townships or surrounding villages, which is paid for by workers earning their money within the urban infrastructure also represents a movement of potential tax dollars from [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] to their dependent areas.\n\n==Tourism and recreation==\n\n===Museums===\n*[[Champaign County Historical Museum]].<ref>[http://www.champaignmuseum.org/ champaignmuseum.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105094655/http://www.champaignmuseum.org/ |date=November 5, 2014 }}</ref>  Located in the Historic Cattle Bank built in 1858.

Christie Clinic, another smaller multi-specialty group practice, is headquartered in downtown [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]. They are largely affiliated with OSF, but not as closely linked as their Carle counterparts are.\n\nBoth hospitals and clinics are affiliated with the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana, part of the larger University of Illinois College of Medicine, which has campuses in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. The College has a teaching presence at both hospitals, although the facilities are somewhat more extensive at Carle Foundation Hospital.\n\nPiatt County, which is included in the Champaign-Urbana Metro Area, also has a hospital. Kirby Medical Center is a general medical and surgical facility located in Monticello. Both Carle Clinic and Christie Clinic have satellite facilities located at Kirby.\n\n==Arts and culture==\n[[Image:vatheatre1010054.JPG|{{largethumb}}|The Virginia Theatre in Downtown Champaign.]]\n\nThe Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area is home to many theatres. The [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University]] is home to three theatre venues; [[Foellinger Auditorium]], [[Assembly Hall (Champaign)|Assembly Hall]] and the [[Krannert Center for the Performing Arts]]. While the Assembly Hall is primarily a campus basketball and concert arena, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts is considered to be one of the nation's top venues for performance and hosts over 400 performances annually. Built in 1969, the Krannert Center's facilities cover over four acres (16,000 m\u00b2) of land, and features four theatres and an amphitheatre.\n\n[[Virginia Theatre (Champaign)|The Historic Virginia Theatre]] in downtown Champaign is a public venue owned by the city of Champaign and administered by the [[Champaign Park District]]. It is best known for hosting [[Roger Ebert]]'s [[Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival|Film Festival]] which occurs annually during the last week of April. The Virginia also features a variety of performances from community theatre with the [[Champaign Urbana Theatre Company]], to post box-office showings of popular films, current artistic films, live musical performances (both orchestral and popular), and other types of shows. First commissioned in 1921, it originally served as a venue for both film and live performances, but became primarily a movie house in the 1950s. Occasional live events were held during the 1970s and 1980s, including a live production of \"Oh, Calcutta\" and performances by [[George Benson]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]], and the [[Indigo Girls]]. GKC Corporation closed the Virginia as a movie house on February 13, 1992, with the final regular film being [[Steve Martin]]'s \"Father of the Bride\". The theatre once again began holding regular live performances when it was leased to local gospel singer David Wyper in 1992. The [[Champaign-Urbana Theatre Company]] was formed to perform major musicals and opened their first season with \"The Music Man\" that June. Control passed to the Virginia Theatre group in 1996 and the theatre became a non-profit public venue. The [[Champaign Park District]] assumed control of the facilities in 2000. Its original Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ<ref>[http://www.theatreorgans.com/il/champaign/ Virginia Theatre Wurlitzer]. Theatreorgans.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.</ref> has been maintained by Warren York since 1988 and is still played regularly.\n\nThe Art Theater<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecuart.com/|title=\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u30d4\u30eb\u3067\u907f\u598a\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044|website=www.thecuart.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> in downtown Champaign began as Champaign's first theatre devoted to movies, the Park, in 1913, and was a small venue showing films not normally playing at the box office. The theatre was the only single-screen movie theatre with daily operation as a movie theatre in Champaign-Urbana. The theater ceased operations on October 31st of 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearttheater.org/thankyou/|title=Thank you, Art patrons|website=http://www.thearttheater.org/|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>.

Staerkel Planetarium.\n\nThe area has originated a great deal of musical talent, starting with [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Head East]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and including [[Hum (band)|HUM]], [[Poster Children]], [[Hardvark]], [[The Moon Seven Times]], [[Braid]], [[AMASONG]], [[Castor (band)|Castor]], [[National Skyline]], [[Love Cup (band)|Love Cup]], [[Absinthe Blind]],[[Headlights (band)|Headlights]] and [[The Beauty Shop (band)|The Beauty Shop]]. Some lesser known artists like [[Alma Afrobeat Ensemble]], [[Zirafa]] and [[Spinnerty]], d-Lo, Bozak, Melodic Scribes, DJ Librarian, [[UC Hiphop]], and [[Zmick]] are also worthy of note on simply a local scale. Champaign-Urbana is relatively well known for producing a rich array of emo, college rock, and black metal.\n\nOpening in 1990 in the heart of downtown Champaign, the Blind Pig Co on Taylor St was one of the first businesses to lead the renaissance of the formerly deserted downtown district. The Blind Pig catered to the budding music community, and indeed fostered many of the local bands. Live music was featured 5 nights a week, and grunge and indy rock bands like the Afghan Whigs, Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair, Pavement and Everclear performed there on numerous occasions. Blues legends like Luther Allison, Ronnie and Lonnie Brooks, Otis Clay and Robert Cotton were also featured, as were international acts like I.K. Dairo, Diblo Diballa, the Five Blind Boys, Malathini and the Mohatella Queens, and Tabuley Rochereau.\n\nThe Blind Pig closed as a music venue in 1998, but re-opened as a craft beer bar in 2004, and a microbrewery in 2009. \n\nThe cities now host [[Pygmalion Music Festival]] on an annual basis, presented by the [[Nicodemus Agency]] and [[Krannert Center for the Performing Arts]]. Past performers include [[Iron and Wine]], [[The Books]], [[Yacht (band)|Yacht]], [[Rjd2]], [[Yo La Tengo]], [[Black Mountain (band)|Black Mountain]], [[Asobi Seksu]], [[Times New Viking]], [[of Montreal]], [[Danielson]], [[Man Man]], [[Okkervil River (band)|Okkervil River]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Questlove]], and more. The 2010 festival took place September 22\u201325.\n\nThe twin cities have a large number and variety of restaurants from long-standing breakfast and pizza traditions to newer, high-end dinner spots with \"Chicago-style\" aspirations. There is a wide representation of cuisines as well as many vegetarian and vegan choices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/cu/vegan|title=vegan - Champaign-Urbana - LocalWiki|author=|date=|website=localwiki.org}}</ref> This has led to state-wide, mentioned on \"Best of Illinois\" lists,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/illinois-cities-ranked-by-their-food-and-drink|title=19 Illinois Cities, Ranked by Their Food and Drink|first=Jay|last=Gentile|date=6 May 2015|website=thrillist.com}}</ref> and regional recognition, receiving the Midwest Living magazine's 'Greatest Food Town' award in 2017 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwestliving.com/travel/the-greatest-midwest-food-towns/|title=The Greatest Midwest Food Towns|author=|date=|website=midwestliving.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enjoyillinois.com/travel-illinois/champaign-urbana-midwest-greatest-food-town/|title=Champaign-Urbana Named the Midwest's Greatest Food|author=|date=|website=enjoyillinois.com}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n*Besides many print outlets, commercial radio stations, and TV stations, Champaign-Urbana has several academic, homegrown and not-for-profit media outlets.\n*[[WEFT]] 90.1 FM is a [[community radio]] station begun by a group of radio enthusiasts, artists, and community-minded individuals working together to realize the potential of bringing a variety of programming and people together behind one frequency.
