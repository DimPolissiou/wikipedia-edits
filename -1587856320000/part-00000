At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains.\n\nThe land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating [[Blue Meanies (Yellow Submarine)|Blue Meanies]], who live beyond the mountains. The attack starts with a music-proof glass globe that imprisons the band. The Blue Meanies fire projectiles and drop apples (a reference to the Beatles' then-new company [[Apple Corps]])<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=_TP3DAAAQBAJ|title=The Encyclopedia of Musicians and Bands on Film|last=Melissa U.

Fred takes off in the Yellow Submarine (\"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\"). He travels to [[Liverpool]] (\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"), where he follows a depressed [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] to \"The Pier\", a house-like building on the top of a hill, and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \"mates\" [[John Lennon|John]], [[George Harrison|George]], and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]], and the five journey back to Pepperland in the submarine. As they operate the submarine, they sing \"[[All Together Now]]\", after which they pass through several regions on their way to Pepperland, including the Sea of Time, where time flows both forwards and backwards (\"[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]\"); the Sea of Science (\"[[Only a Northern Song]]\"); and the Sea of Monsters, where Ringo is rescued from monsters after being ejected from the submarine. In the Sea of Nothing, the protagonists meet [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]] Ph.D., a short and studious creature (\"[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]\"). As they prepare to leave, Ringo feels sorry for the lonely Boob, and invites him to join them aboard the submarine. They arrive at the Foothills of the Headlands, where they are separated from the submarine and Old Fred (\"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\"). They then find themselves in the Sea of Holes, an expanse of flat surfaces with many holes. Jeremy is kidnapped by a Blue Meanie, and the group finds their way to Pepperland.\n\nReuniting with Old Fred and reviving the Lord Mayor, they look upon the now-miserable, grey landscape. The Beatles dress up as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and steal some instruments. The four rally the land to rebellion (\"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\"). The [[Chief Blue Meanie]] retaliates by sending out the Dreadful Flying Glove, but John defeats by singing (\"[[All You Need is Love]]\"). Pepperland is restored to colour as its flowers re-bloom and its residents revive. The original Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are released, and join the Beatles in combating the Meanies' multi-headed dog (\"[[Hey Bulldog]]\"). Jeremy performs some \"transformation magic\" on the Chief Blue Meanie, causing the Meanie to bloom roses and sadly concede defeat. John extends an offer of friendship, and the Chief Blue Meanie has a change of heart and accepts. An enormous party ensues (\"[[It's All Too Much]]\").\n\nThe real Beatles then appear in [[live-action]], and playfully show off souvenirs from the events of the film. George has the submarine's motor, Paul has \"a little 'love'\", and Ringo has \"half a hole\" in his pocket (having supposedly given the other half to Jeremy). Ringo points out John looking through a telescope, which prompts Paul to ask what he sees. John replies that \"newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre\" and claims there is only one way to go out: \"Singing!\" The four oblige with a short reprise of \"All Together Now\", which ends with translations of the song's title in various languages appearing in sequence on the screen.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[John Clive]] as [[John Lennon|John]]\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] as [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]\n* Peter Batten as [[George Harrison|George]] ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Paul Angelis]] as Opening Narrator / [[Chief Blue Meanie]] / [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] / George ''(additional dialogue)''\n* [[Dick Emery]] as Max / Lord Mayor / [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]]\n* [[Lance Percival]] as \"Young/Old\" Fred\n\n'''<small>Sources:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/fullcredits#cast Yellow Submarine (1968) \u2013 Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[[Apple Corps]], 2012.</ref></small>'''\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* According to the special features section of the ''Yellow Submarine'' home media release, Peter Batten provided the voice of George for about the first half of the film. Before he finished recording for the film, he was discovered to be a [[deserter]] from the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in [[West Germany]], and was arrested. His part was completed by Angelis, who was also the voice of Ringo and the Chief Blue Meanie.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/aug/24/artsfeatures2|last=Espiner|first=Mark|title=The Fake Four | location=London |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 August 1999|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n* Percival also provided the voices of Paul and Ringo for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV cartoon series ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[The Beatles]] were not enthusiastic about participating in a new motion picture, having been dissatisfied with their second feature film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), directed by [[Richard Lester]]. However, they saw an animated film as a favourable way to complete their commitment to [[United Artists]] for a third film. Many fans have assumed that the cartoon did not satisfy the contract, but ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' (1970) was the film not connected to the original three-picture deal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hieronimus|first1=Dr Robert|title=Inside the Yellow Submarine|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87349-360-5|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles make a live-action [[cameo appearance]] in the final scene, which was filmed on 25 January 1968, shortly before the band's [[The Beatles in India|trip to India]]. This was done primarily to fulfill their contractual obligation to United Artists to actually appear in the film. The cameo was originally intended to feature a post-production psychedelic background and effects, but because of time and budget constraints, a blank, black background remained in the final film. While Starr and McCartney still looked the same as their animated counterparts, Lennon's and Harrison's physical appearances had changed by the time the cameo was shot. Both were clean-shaven, and Lennon had begun to grow his hair longer with accompanying mutton-chop [[sideburns]].\n\nThe original story was written by Lee Minoff, based on the song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the screenplay was penned by four collaborators including [[Erich Segal]]. George Harrison's character's recurring line \"It's all in the mind\" is taken from ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nAs with many motion-picture [[Musical film|musicals]], the music takes precedence over the actual plot, and most of the story is a series of [[set piece]]s designed to present Beatles music set to various images, in a form reminiscent of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (and foreshadowing the rise of music videos and MTV thirteen years later). {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Nonetheless, the film still presents a modern-day [[fairy tale]] representing the values of its intended [[hippie]] audience.\n\nThe dialogue is littered with [[pun]]s, [[double entendre]]s and Beatles in-jokes. In the DVD [[Audio commentary|commentary track]], production supervisor John Coates states that many of these lines were written by Liverpudlian poet [[Roger McGough]], though he received no credit in the film.\n\nIn the DVD commentary track, Coates states that the Meanies were always intended to be coloured blue. However, Millicent McMillan recalls that the Blue Meanies were originally supposed to be red, or even purple, but when [[Heinz Edelmann]]'s assistant accidentally changed the colours, the film's characters took on a different meaning.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-hidden\">{{cite web | last = Hieronimus | first = Robert R. | date = 11 September 1999 | url = http://www.21stcenturyradio.com/yellowsub/billboard.html | title = The Hidden Stories Behind Yellow Submarine | work = Billboard | accessdate = 19 April 2009}}</ref> Coates acknowledges in the commentary that the \"are you Bluish? You don't look Bluish\" joke in the film is a pun on the then-contemporary expression \"you don't look Jewish\", but that it was not intended to be derogatory.\n\n===Animation===\nThe Beatles' animated personas were based on their appearance in the promotional film for the song \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\", with the exception of Paul being without his moustache. The film also includes several references to songs not included in the soundtrack, including \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the lyrics of which are referenced in the \"Sea of Holes\" scene; the orchestral breaks earlier in the film are also taken from the song.\n\nNational and foreign animators were assembled by TVC. American animators [[Robert Balser]] and [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] were hired as the film's animation directors.<ref name=awn>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title='Yellow Submarine' Animation Director Robert Balser Passes at 88 |url=http://www.awn.com/news/yellow-submarine-animation-director-robert-balser-passes-88  |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Robert Balser, Animation Director on 'Yellow Submarine,' Dies at 88 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-balser-dead-yellow-submarine-852980  |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=7 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref> Charlie Jenkins, one of the film's key creative directors, was responsible for the entire \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\" sequence, as well as the submarine travel from Liverpool, through London, to splashdown. Jenkins also was responsible for \"Only a Northern Song\" in the Sea of Science, plus much of the multi-image sequences. A large crew of skilled animators, including (in alphabetical order) Alan Ball, [[Ron Campbell (animator)|Ron Campbell]], John Challis, Hester Coblentz, Geoff Collins, Rich Cox, Duane Crowther, Tony Cuthbert, Malcolm Draper, [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]], Cam Ford, Norm Drew, Tom Halley, Dick Horne, Arthur Humberstone, Dennis Hunt, [[Greg Irons]], [[Dianne Jackson]], [[Anne Jolliffe]], Dave Livesey, Reg Lodge, Geoff Loynes, Lawrence Moorcroft, Ted Percival, Mike Pocock, [[Gerald Potterton]], and Peter Tupy, were responsible for bringing the animated Beatles to life. The background work was executed by artists under the direction of [[Alison de Vere]] and Millicent McMillan, who were both background supervisors. Ted Lewis and Chris Miles were responsible for animation cleanup.\n\n[[George Dunning]], who also worked on [[The Beatles (TV series)|the Beatles cartoon series]], was the overall director for the film, supervising over 200 artists for 11 months. \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" was Dunning's idea, which he turned over to Bill Sewell, who delivered more than thirty minutes of [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] images. By that time, Dunning was unavailable, and Bob Balser, with the help of Arne Gustafson, edited the material to its sequence length in the film.\n\nThe animation design of ''Yellow Submarine'' has sometimes been incorrectly attributed to famous psychedelic [[pop art]] artist of the era [[Peter Max]], but the film's art director was [[Heinz Edelmann]]. Edelmann, along with his contemporary [[Milton Glaser]], pioneered the psychedelic style for which Max would later become famous, but according to Edelmann and producer Al Brodax, as quoted in the book ''Inside the Yellow Submarine'' by Hieronimus and Cortner, Max had nothing to do with the production of ''Yellow Submarine''.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-inside\">{{Cite book | last =Hieronimus | first =Robert |author2=Laura Cortner | title =Inside the Yellow Submarine | year =2002 | publisher =Krause Publications | location =Iola, Wisconsin, USA | isbn =0-87349-360-5 | page =81 | chapter =| chapterurl =| quote =}}</ref>\n \nEdelmann's surreal visual style contrasts greatly with the efforts of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and other animated Hollywood films that had been previously released at the time. The film uses a style of [[limited animation]]. It also paved the way for [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations for ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (particularly the ''Eleanor Rigby'' sequence), as well as the ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'' vignettes for ABC and similar-looking animation in early seasons of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]''. (Only one of the animation staff of ''Yellow Submarine'', Ron Campbell, contributed subsequent animation to  [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]].)\n\n===Music===\nIn addition to the 1966 title song \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\", several complete or excerpted songs, four previously unreleased, were used in the film. The songs included \"[[All Together Now]]\", \"[[It's All Too Much]]\" (written by Harrison), \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\" (which had first appeared as the [[B-side]] to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" in June 1967), \"[[Only a Northern Song]]\" (a Harrison composition originally recorded during sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]])'' and \"[[Hey Bulldog]]\". Written by Lennon, this last track was cut from the film before it opened in the US. \"Hey Bulldog\" was restored for the US theatrical and home video reissue in 1999. The four new songs used on the soundtrack album were not considered of high enough quality for appearance on a \"regular\" Beatles album.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe film's instrumental music was an orchestral score composed and arranged by [[George Martin]]. One of the film's cues, heard after the main title credits, was originally recorded during sessions for \"[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]\" (a track on ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', also known as the \"White Album\") and would have been used as the introduction to Ringo Starr's White Album composition \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\".

Released in the midst of the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] pop culture of the 1960s, the film drew in moviegoers both for its lush, wildly creative images and its soundtrack of Beatles songs. The film was distributed worldwide by [[United Artists]] in two versions. The version shown in [[Europe]] included an extra musical number, \"Hey Bulldog\", heard in the final third of the film. For release in the United States, the number was replaced with alternative animation because of time constraints. It was felt that, at the time, American audiences would grow tired from the length of the film. Despite the Beatles connection, the film was not a commercial success.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Silver |first1=David |title=The Compleat Beatles DVD |work=The Compleat Beatles |agency=Delilah Films, Inc. |issue=First release |publisher=MGM/UA Entertainment Co. |date=1982}}</ref>\nThe film realized receipts of more than $992,000 USD in the US and more than $280,000 USD internationally.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine - Financial Information |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Yellow-Submarine#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1896121857/weekend/ |website=Box Office Mojo |publisher=IMDB.com |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref> For reference, the top-grossing films for 1968 were in excess of $50M in the domestic market alone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Funny Girl (1968) |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Funny-Girl-%281968%29#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=2001: a space odyssey |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/2001-A-Space-Odyssey#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Informatioon Services, LLC |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film currently holds a 97% approval rating based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine |website=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Fandango |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref> The website's critical consensus states: \"A joyful, phantasmagoric blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles, ''Yellow Submarine'' is delightful (and occasionally melancholy) family fare.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine/ | title =Yellow Submarine (1968) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate =29 June 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/yellow-submarine |title=Yellow Submarine Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rights and distribution==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nOf all the Beatles films released by United Artists, ''Yellow Submarine'' been the only one to which UA retained the rights, leading up to its purchase by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1981.

Fred takes off in the Yellow Submarine (\"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\"). He travels to [[Liverpool]] (\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"), where he follows a depressed [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] to \"The Pier\", a house-like building on the top of a hill, and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \"mates\" [[John Lennon|John]], [[George Harrison|George]], and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]], and the five journey back to Pepperland in the submarine. As they operate the submarine, they sing \"[[All Together Now]]\", after which they pass through several regions on their way to Pepperland, including the Sea of Time, where time flows both forwards and backwards (\"[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]\"); the Sea of Science (\"[[Only a Northern Song]]\"); and the Sea of Monsters, where Ringo is rescued from monsters after being ejected from the submarine. In the Sea of Nothing, the protagonists meet [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]] Ph.D., a short and studious creature (\"[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]\"). As they prepare to leave, Ringo feels sorry for the lonely Boob, and invites him to join them aboard the submarine. They arrive at the Foothills of the Headlands, where they are separated from the submarine and Old Fred (\"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\"). They then find themselves in the Sea of Holes, an expanse of flat surfaces with many holes. Jeremy is kidnapped by a Blue Meanie, and the group finds their way to Pepperland.\n\nReuniting with Old Fred and reviving the Lord Mayor, they look upon the now-miserable, grey landscape. The Beatles dress up as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and steal some instruments. The four rally the land to rebellion (\"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\"). The [[Chief Blue Meanie]] retaliates by sending out the Dreadful Flying Glove, but John defeats by singing (\"[[All You Need is Love]]\"). Pepperland is restored to colour as its flowers re-bloom and its residents revive. The original Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are released, and join the Beatles in combating the Meanies' multi-headed dog (\"[[Hey Bulldog]]\"). Jeremy performs some \"transformation magic\" on the Chief Blue Meanie, causing the Meanie to bloom roses and sadly concede defeat. John extends an offer of friendship, and the Chief Blue Meanie has a change of heart and accepts. An enormous party ensues (\"[[It's All Too Much]]\").\n\nThe real Beatles then appear in [[live-action]], and playfully show off souvenirs from the events of the film. George has the submarine's motor, Paul has \"a little 'love'\", and Ringo has \"half a hole\" in his pocket (having supposedly given the other half to Jeremy). Ringo points out John looking through a telescope, which prompts Paul to ask what he sees. John replies that \"newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre\" and claims there is only one way to go out: \"Singing!\" The four oblige with a short reprise of \"All Together Now\", which ends with translations of the song's title in various languages appearing in sequence on the screen.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[John Clive]] as [[John Lennon|John]]\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] as [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]\n* Peter Batten as [[George Harrison|George]] ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Paul Angelis]] as Opening Narrator / [[Chief Blue Meanie]] / [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] / George ''(additional dialogue)''\n* [[Dick Emery]] as Max / Lord Mayor / [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]]\n* [[Lance Percival]] as \"Young/Old\" Fred\n\n'''<small>Sources:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/fullcredits#cast Yellow Submarine (1968) \u2013 Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[[Apple Corps]], 2012.</ref></small>'''\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* According to the special features section of the ''Yellow Submarine'' home media release, Peter Batten provided the voice of George for about the first half of the film. Before he finished recording for the film, he was discovered to be a [[deserter]] from the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in [[West Germany]], and was arrested. His part was completed by Angelis, who was also the voice of Ringo and the Chief Blue Meanie.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/aug/24/artsfeatures2|last=Espiner|first=Mark|title=The Fake Four | location=London |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 August 1999|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n* Percival also provided the voices of Paul and Ringo for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV cartoon series ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[The Beatles]] were not enthusiastic about participating in a new motion picture, having been dissatisfied with their second feature film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), directed by [[Richard Lester]]. However, they saw an animated film as a favourable way to complete their commitment to [[United Artists]] for a third film. Many fans have assumed that the cartoon did not satisfy the contract, but ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' (1970) was the film not connected to the original three-picture deal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hieronimus|first1=Dr Robert|title=Inside the Yellow Submarine|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87349-360-5|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles make a live-action [[cameo appearance]] in the final scene, which was filmed on 25 January 1968, shortly before the band's [[The Beatles in India|trip to India]]. This was done primarily to fulfill their contractual obligation to United Artists to actually appear in the film. The cameo was originally intended to feature a post-production psychedelic background and effects, but because of time and budget constraints, a blank, black background remained in the final film. While Starr and McCartney still looked the same as their animated counterparts, Lennon's and Harrison's physical appearances had changed by the time the cameo was shot. Both were clean-shaven, and Lennon had begun to grow his hair longer with accompanying mutton-chop [[sideburns]].\n\nThe original story was written by Lee Minoff, based on the song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the screenplay was penned by four collaborators including [[Erich Segal]]. George Harrison's character's recurring line \"It's all in the mind\" is taken from ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nAs with many motion-picture [[Musical film|musicals]], the music takes precedence over the actual plot, and most of the story is a series of [[set piece]]s designed to present Beatles music set to various images, in a form reminiscent of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (and foreshadowing the rise of music videos and MTV thirteen years later). {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Nonetheless, the film still presents a modern-day [[fairy tale]] representing the values of its intended [[hippie]] audience.\n\nThe dialogue is littered with [[pun]]s, [[double entendre]]s and Beatles in-jokes. In the DVD [[Audio commentary|commentary track]], production supervisor John Coates states that many of these lines were written by Liverpudlian poet [[Roger McGough]], though he received no credit in the film.\n\nIn the DVD commentary track, Coates states that the Meanies were always intended to be coloured blue. However, Millicent McMillan recalls that the Blue Meanies were originally supposed to be red, or even purple, but when [[Heinz Edelmann]]'s assistant accidentally changed the colours, the film's characters took on a different meaning.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-hidden\">{{cite web | last = Hieronimus | first = Robert R. | date = 11 September 1999 | url = http://www.21stcenturyradio.com/yellowsub/billboard.html | title = The Hidden Stories Behind Yellow Submarine | work = Billboard | accessdate = 19 April 2009}}</ref> Coates acknowledges in the commentary that the \"are you Bluish? You don't look Bluish\" joke in the film is a pun on the then-contemporary expression \"you don't look Jewish\", but that it was not intended to be derogatory.\n\n===Animation===\nThe Beatles' animated personas were based on their appearance in the promotional film for the song \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\", with the exception of Paul being without his moustache. The film also includes several references to songs not included in the soundtrack, including \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the lyrics of which are referenced in the \"Sea of Holes\" scene; the orchestral breaks earlier in the film are also taken from the song.\n\nNational and foreign animators were assembled by TVC. American animators [[Robert Balser]] and [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] were hired as the film's animation directors.<ref name=awn>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title='Yellow Submarine' Animation Director Robert Balser Passes at 88 |url=http://www.awn.com/news/yellow-submarine-animation-director-robert-balser-passes-88  |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Robert Balser, Animation Director on 'Yellow Submarine,' Dies at 88 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-balser-dead-yellow-submarine-852980  |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=7 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref> Charlie Jenkins, one of the film's key creative directors, was responsible for the entire \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\" sequence, as well as the submarine travel from Liverpool, through London, to splashdown. Jenkins also was responsible for \"Only a Northern Song\" in the Sea of Science, plus much of the multi-image sequences. A large crew of skilled animators, including (in alphabetical order) Alan Ball, [[Ron Campbell (animator)|Ron Campbell]], John Challis, Hester Coblentz, Geoff Collins, Rich Cox, Duane Crowther, Tony Cuthbert, Malcolm Draper, [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]], Cam Ford, Norm Drew, Tom Halley, Dick Horne, Arthur Humberstone, Dennis Hunt, [[Greg Irons]], [[Dianne Jackson]], [[Anne Jolliffe]], Dave Livesey, Reg Lodge, Geoff Loynes, Lawrence Moorcroft, Ted Percival, Mike Pocock, [[Gerald Potterton]], and Peter Tupy, were responsible for bringing the animated Beatles to life. The background work was executed by artists under the direction of [[Alison de Vere]] and Millicent McMillan, who were both background supervisors. Ted Lewis and Chris Miles were responsible for animation cleanup.\n\n[[George Dunning]], who also worked on [[The Beatles (TV series)|the Beatles cartoon series]], was the overall director for the film, supervising over 200 artists for 11 months. \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" was Dunning's idea, which he turned over to Bill Sewell, who delivered more than thirty minutes of [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] images. By that time, Dunning was unavailable, and Bob Balser, with the help of Arne Gustafson, edited the material to its sequence length in the film.\n\nThe animation design of ''Yellow Submarine'' has sometimes been incorrectly attributed to famous psychedelic [[pop art]] artist of the era [[Peter Max]], but the film's art director was [[Heinz Edelmann]]. Edelmann, along with his contemporary [[Milton Glaser]], pioneered the psychedelic style for which Max would later become famous, but according to Edelmann and producer Al Brodax, as quoted in the book ''Inside the Yellow Submarine'' by Hieronimus and Cortner, Max had nothing to do with the production of ''Yellow Submarine''.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-inside\">{{Cite book | last =Hieronimus | first =Robert |author2=Laura Cortner | title =Inside the Yellow Submarine | year =2002 | publisher =Krause Publications | location =Iola, Wisconsin, USA | isbn =0-87349-360-5 | page =81 | chapter =| chapterurl =| quote =}}</ref>\n \nEdelmann's surreal visual style contrasts greatly with the efforts of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and other animated Hollywood films that had been previously released at the time. The film uses a style of [[limited animation]]. It also paved the way for [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations for ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (particularly the ''Eleanor Rigby'' sequence), as well as the ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'' vignettes for ABC and similar-looking animation in early seasons of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]''. (Only one of the animation staff of ''Yellow Submarine'', Ron Campbell, contributed subsequent animation to  [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]].)\n\n===Music===\nIn addition to the 1966 title song \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\", several complete or excerpted songs, four previously unreleased, were used in the film. The songs included \"[[All Together Now]]\", \"[[It's All Too Much]]\" (written by Harrison), \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\" (which had first appeared as the [[B-side]] to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" in June 1967), \"[[Only a Northern Song]]\" (a Harrison composition originally recorded during sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]])'' and \"[[Hey Bulldog]]\". Written by Lennon, this last track was cut from the film before it opened in the US. \"Hey Bulldog\" was restored for the US theatrical and home video reissue in 1999. The four new songs used on the soundtrack album were not considered of high enough quality for appearance on a \"regular\" Beatles album.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe film's instrumental music was an orchestral score composed and arranged by [[George Martin]]. One of the film's cues, heard after the main title credits, was originally recorded during sessions for \"[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]\" (a track on ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', also known as the \"White Album\") and would have been used as the introduction to Ringo Starr's White Album composition \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\". The same cue was later released as \"[[A Beginning]]\" on the 1996 Beatles compilation ''[[Anthology 3]]''.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n:All tracks written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] except where noted.\n\n:Track start and end time is indicated in [[hour|hrs]]:[[minute|mins]]:[[second|secs]].

Released in the midst of the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] pop culture of the 1960s, the film drew in moviegoers both for its lush, wildly creative images and its soundtrack of Beatles songs. The film was distributed worldwide by [[United Artists]] in two versions. The version shown in [[Europe]] included an extra musical number, \"Hey Bulldog\", heard in the final third of the film. For release in the United States, the number was replaced with alternative animation because of time constraints. It was felt that, at the time, American audiences would grow tired from the length of the film. Despite the Beatles connection, the film was not a commercial success.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Silver |first1=David |title=The Compleat Beatles DVD |work=The Compleat Beatles |agency=Delilah Films, Inc. |issue=First release |publisher=MGM/UA Entertainment Co. |date=1982}}</ref>\nThe film realized receipts of more than $992,000 USD in the US and more than $280,000 USD internationally.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine - Financial Information |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Yellow-Submarine#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1896121857/weekend/ |website=Box Office Mojo |publisher=IMDB.com |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref> For reference, the top-grossing films for 1968 were in excess of $50M in the domestic market alone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Funny Girl (1968) |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Funny-Girl-%281968%29#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=2001: a space odyssey |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/2001-A-Space-Odyssey#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Informatioon Services, LLC |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film currently holds a 97% approval rating based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Yellow Submarine |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine |website=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Fandango |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref> The website's critical consensus states: \"A joyful, phantasmagoric blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles, ''Yellow Submarine'' is delightful (and occasionally melancholy) family fare.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine/ | title =Yellow Submarine (1968) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate =29 June 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/yellow-submarine |title=Yellow Submarine Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rights and distribution==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nOf all the Beatles films released by United Artists, ''Yellow Submarine'' been the only one to which UA retained the rights, leading up to its purchase by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1981.

In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of ''both'' technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet|title=Internet legal definition of Internet|publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary|date=15 July 2009|encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www|title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition|publisher=TechTerms|accessdate=19 February 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015356/http://www.techterms.com/definition/www|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209063216/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].\n\nBerners-Lee was [[Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 2004 by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for \"services to the global development of the Internet\".<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web|title=Supplement no.1, Diplomatic and Overseas List, K.B.E.|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|website=thegazette.co.uk|publisher=The Gazette|date=31 December 2003|accessdate=7 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203092022/https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Web's inventor gets a knighthood|publisher=BBC|date=31 December 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|accessdate=25 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He never patented his invention.\n\n== Function ==\n{{main|HTTP|HTML}}\n[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|The World Wide Web functions as an [[application layer]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] that is run \"on top of\" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional.  The advent of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser helped to make the web much more usable, to include the display of images and moving images ([[GIF]]s).]]\n\nThe terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><title></syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></syntaxhighlight> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|Website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]]. Notable examples are [[wikipedia|wikipedia.org]], [[google|google.com]], and [[Amazon (company)|amazon.com]].\n\nA website may be accessible via a public [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network, such as the [[Internet]], or a private [[local area network]] (LAN), by referencing a [[URL|uniform resource locator]] (URL) that identifies the site.\n\nWebsites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a [[personal website]], a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and [[social networking]] to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an [[intranet]].\n\nWeb pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are [[document]]s, typically composed in [[plain text]] interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ([[HTML]], [[XHTML]]). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable [[HTML anchor|markup anchors]]. Web pages are accessed and transported with the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ([[HTTP Secure]], HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a [[web browser]], renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a [[Computer monitor|display terminal]].\n\n[[Hyperlink]]ing between web pages conveys to the reader the [[site map|site structure]] and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a [[home page]] containing a directory of the site [[web content]]. Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs). The information may be a mix of [[web page]]s, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers and other types of files. Some search engines also [[data mining|mine data]] available in [[database]]s or [[web directory|open directories]].  Unlike [[web directories]], which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain [[real-time computing|real-time]] information by running an [[algorithm]] on a [[web crawler]].\nInternet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the [[deep web]].\n\n===Deep web===\n{{main|Deep web}}\nThe deep web,<ref name=\"nhamilton\">{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.90.5847|title=The Mechanics of a Deep Net Metasearch Engine|last=Hamilton|first=Nigel}}</ref> ''invisible web'',<ref name=\"jal\">{{cite journal|title=Beyond google: the invisible web in the academic library |volume=30|issue=4|date=July 2004|pages=265\u2013269|last1=Devine|first1=Jane|last2=Egger-Sider|first2=Francine|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2004.04.010 }}</ref> or ''hidden web''<ref name=\"cthw\">{{cite journal|title=Crawling the Hidden Web|journal=27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases|date=September 11\u201314, 2001|first1=Sriram|last1=Raghavan|first2=Hector|last2=Garcia-Molina|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/725/}}</ref> are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] by standard [[web search engine]]s.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of

A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in case of [[W3C]] specifications, the highest maturity level).\n\n== Accessibility ==\n{{Main|Web accessibility}}\nThere are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.<ref name=WAI>{{cite web|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001730/http://www.w3.org/WAI/|archivedate=2 April 2009}}</ref> The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society.

In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of ''both'' technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format.

However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><title></syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></syntaxhighlight> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]]. Notable examples are [[wikipedia]].org, [[google]].com, and [[Amazon (company)|amazon.com]].\n\nA website may be accessible via a public [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network, such as the [[Internet]], or a private [[local area network]] (LAN), by referencing a [[URL|uniform resource locator]] (URL) that identifies the site.\n\nWebsites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a [[personal website]], a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and [[social networking]] to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an [[intranet]].\n\nWeb pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are [[document]]s, typically composed in [[plain text]] interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ([[HTML]], [[XHTML]]). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable [[HTML anchor|markup anchors]]. Web pages are accessed and transported with the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ([[HTTP Secure]], HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a [[web browser]], renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a [[Computer monitor|display terminal]].\n\n[[Hyperlink]]ing between web pages conveys to the reader the [[site map|site structure]] and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a [[home page]] containing a directory of the site [[web content]]. Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide [[personally identifiable information]] is by using a [[VPN]]. A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company.
