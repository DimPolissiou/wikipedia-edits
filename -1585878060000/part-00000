The character serves as the main antagonist of ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' and its sequel, ''[[EarthBound]]''. He invades Earth in an attempt to wipe out humanity in ''Mother'', and returns in ''EarthBound'' where he conquers the world and sends his forces into the past to ensure that protagonist [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]] could not defeat him. The battle against Giygas, which depicts him in turmoil, drew inspiration from a Japanese film which traumatized Itoi as a child. He has received positive reception with critics referring to his battle as one of the creepiest and most difficult in video games. He has been the subject of analysis and speculation, with an [[urban legend]] being spread about the final battle with him in ''EarthBound'' being a representation of an abortion, which staff denied.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nGiygas was designed and written by the creator of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'' series]],  [[Shigesato Itoi]], and debuted in the original ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]''. He is known as Gyiyg in Japanese and Giegue in the canceled English localization. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas in ''EarthBound'' resulted from a traumatic childhood event where he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a [[Shintoho]] film entitled ''[[Kenpei to barabara shibijin]]''. The film featured a murder scene near a river that Itoi mistook for a rape scene which affected him so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas' dialogue for the final battle. Itoi described Giygas as something that people cannot make sense of, but also as a living being who deserves love. He described the film scene as a combination of atrocity and eroticism, and that is what his lines are in the end. While designing this battle, Itoi spoke all of the text out loud while another staff member, Matchan Miura, wrote it down. He spoke each [[hiragana]] character one by one because he found it scarier.<ref name = \"Itoi interview\">{{cite interview |first=Itoi |last=Shigesato |url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/07.html |title=[Interview with Shigesato Itoi] |work=1101.com |date=April 24, 2003 |language=Japanese |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QrkuC8iK?url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/07.html |archive-date=July 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"1101.com\">{{cite interview |last=Shigesato |first=Itoi |title=[Interview with Shigesato Itoi] |url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/03.html |language=Japanese |work=1101.com |date=April 18, 2003 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330065450/http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/03.html |archive-date=March 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> There has been a misunderstanding regarding the influence of the film on Giygas, with some believing that imagery, dialogue, or audio from that film were used here, when the only thing Itoi took from it was the ability to \"manipulate an audience's emotional state.\"<ref name=\"lol\"/> Music composer [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] described Giygas as the \"embodiment of evil\".

George studied the aliens' PSI powers without permission and escaped back to Earth. Once he matured, Giygas was tasked by his people to make sure that PSI never spread onto Earth. However, Giygas did not want to betray those who raised him, particularly Maria. In the end, he forced himself to detach from Maria and began preparations for the aliens' invasion. Eighty years later, strange things start happening on Earth. These events are eventually revealed to be the work of Giygas. Maria, now a Queen in a magical world called Magicant, explains everything to the protagonists of ''Mother'' after her memories are restored. When the protagonists encounter Giygas, he explains his motives to them while attacking them with his PSI power. Maria urges protagonist Ninten to sing, which weakens Giygas. Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd sing together, forcing Giygas to surrender and flee.\n\nGiygas also appears in the [[Super NES]] sequel ''[[EarthBound]]''.<ref name=\"1up\"/> Giygas is an unseen villain for most of the story, although he possesses humans, animals, and objects who unknowingly do his bidding. According to a character from the future named Buzz Buzz, Giygas destroys the universe ten years in the future. One of his key minions is Pokey Minch, a former friend of protagonist [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]]. At first, Dr. Andonuts (the father of playable character [[Jeff Andonuts|Jeff]]) believes that Giygas is residing deep within the Earth, and transports himself and the party there using a machine called the Phase Distorter. When they arrive, they find that Giygas is attacking from that exact location, but from innumerable years in the past. The only way the protagonists can get to Giygas' time period is to alter the Phase Distorter to transport them back in time. When the group finally reaches Giygas, he initially resembles Ness while in the device called the \"Devil's Machine.\" Pokey eventually turns the Devil's Machine off, thereby destroying Giygas' body and mind by releasing his power and driving him mad. At this point, Giygas' words are nondescript and nonsensical. Giygas is eventually destroyed by Paula, who prays to the protagonists' friends and family for help. Her praying eventually reaches the player, and the combined prayers do enough damage to Giygas, killing him.\n\n==Reception==\nSince appearing in ''[[EarthBound]]'', Giygas has received largely positive reception. His role and design was regarded as contrasting with the otherwise lighthearted tone of the rest of ''EarthBound''{{'}}s story by Brittany Vincent for ''[[G4TV]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top

The character serves as the main antagonist of ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' and its sequel, ''[[EarthBound]]''. He invades Earth in an attempt to wipe out humanity in ''Mother'', and returns in ''EarthBound'' where he conquers the world and sends his forces into the past to ensure that protagonist [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]] could not defeat him. The battle against Giygas, which depicts him in turmoil, drew inspiration from a Japanese film which traumatized Itoi as a child. He has received positive reception with critics referring to his battle as one of the creepiest and most difficult in video games. He has been the subject of analysis and speculation, with an [[urban legend]] being spread about the final battle with him in ''EarthBound'' being a representation of an abortion, which staff denied.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nGiygas was designed and written by the creator of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'' series]],  [[Shigesato Itoi]], and debuted in the original ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]''. He is known as Gyiyg in Japanese and Giegue in the canceled English localization. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas in ''EarthBound'' resulted from a traumatic childhood event where he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a [[Shintoho]] film entitled ''[[Kenpei to barabara shibijin]]''. The film featured a murder scene near a river that Itoi mistook for a rape scene which affected him so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas' dialogue for the final battle. Itoi described Giygas as something that people cannot make sense of, but also as a living being who deserves love. He described the film scene as a combination of atrocity and eroticism, and that is what his lines are in the end. While designing this battle, Itoi spoke all of the text out loud while another staff member, Matchan Miura, wrote it down. He spoke each [[hiragana]] character one by one because he found it scarier.<ref name = \"Itoi interview\">{{cite interview |first=Itoi |last=Shigesato |url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/07.html |title=[Interview with Shigesato Itoi] |work=1101.com |date=April 24, 2003 |language=Japanese |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QrkuC8iK?url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/07.html |archive-date=July 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"1101.com\">{{cite interview |last=Shigesato |first=Itoi |title=[Interview with Shigesato Itoi] |url=http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/03.html |language=Japanese |work=1101.com |date=April 18, 2003 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330065450/http://www.1101.com/MOTHER/03.html |archive-date=March 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> There has been a misunderstanding regarding the influence of the film on Giygas, with some believing that imagery, dialogue, or audio from that film were used here, when the only thing Itoi took from it was the ability to \"manipulate an audience's emotional state.\"<ref name=\"lol\"/> Music composer [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] described Giygas as the \"embodiment of evil\".

George studied the aliens' PSI powers without permission and escaped back to Earth. Once he matured, Giygas was tasked by his people to make sure that PSI never spread onto Earth. However, Giygas did not want to betray those who raised him, particularly Maria. In the end, he forced himself to detach from Maria and began preparations for the aliens' invasion. Eighty years later, strange things start happening on Earth. These events are eventually revealed to be the work of Giygas. Maria, now a Queen in a magical world called Magicant, explains everything to the protagonists of ''Mother'' after her memories are restored. When the protagonists encounter Giygas, he explains his motives to them while attacking them with his PSI power. Maria urges protagonist Ninten to sing, which weakens Giygas. Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd sing together, forcing Giygas to surrender and flee.\n\nGiygas also appears in the [[Super NES]] sequel ''[[EarthBound]]''.<ref name=\"1up\"/> Giygas is an unseen villain for most of the story, although he possesses humans, animals, and objects who unknowingly do his bidding. According to a character from the future named Buzz Buzz, Giygas destroys the universe ten years in the future. One of his key minions is Pokey Minch, a former friend of protagonist [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]]. At first, Dr. Andonuts (the father of playable character [[Jeff Andonuts|Jeff]]) believes that Giygas is residing deep within the Earth, and transports himself and the party there using a machine called the Phase Distorter. When they arrive, they find that Giygas is attacking from that exact location, but from innumerable years in the past. The only way the protagonists can get to Giygas' time period is to alter the Phase Distorter to transport them back in time. When the group finally reaches Giygas, he initially resembles Ness while in the device called the \"Devil's Machine.\" Porky eventually turns the Devil's Machine off, thereby destroying Giygas' body and mind by releasing his power and driving him mad. At this point, Giygas' words are nondescript and nonsensical. Giygas is eventually destroyed by Paula, who prays to the protagonists' friends and family for help. Her praying eventually reaches the player, and the combined prayers do enough damage to Giygas, killing him.\n\n==Reception==\nSince appearing in ''[[EarthBound]]'', Giygas has received largely positive reception.

{"title_page": "Vertical integration", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|When a company owns its supply chain}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = February 2019}}\n[[File:Integration in English.svg|thumb|right|A diagram illustrating horizontal integration and contrasting it with vertical integration.]]\n{{Marketing}}\n\nIn [[microeconomics]] and [[management]], '''vertical integration''' is an arrangement in which the [[supply chain]] of a company is owned by that company. Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different [[product (business)|product]] or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need. It is contrasted with [[horizontal integration]], wherein a company produces several items that are related to one another. Vertical integration has also described [[management style]]s that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership but also into one [[corporation]] (as in the 1920s when the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] began making much of its own steel rather than buying it from suppliers).\n\nVertical integration and expansion is desired because it secures supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Vertical integration and expansion can become undesirable when its actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace. Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the [[hold-up problem]]. A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a ''vertical monopoly''.\n\n==Vertical expansion==\nVertical integration is often closely associated to vertical expansion which, in [[economics]], is the growth of a business enterprise through the [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product. Such expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the [[business|firm]] to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Such expansion can become undesirable when its actions become [[anti-competitive]] and impede free competition in an open marketplace.\n\nThe result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits. On the undesirable side, when vertical expansion leads toward [[monopoly|monopolistic]] control of a product or service then regulative action may be required to rectify anti-competitive behavior. Related to vertical expansion is [[lateral expansion]], which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving [[economies of scale]].\n\nVertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition. Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase scales and to gain market power. The acquisition of [[DirecTV]] by [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] is an example of forward vertical expansion or acquisition. DirecTV is a [[satellite TV]] company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies and television shows. The acquisition of [[NBC]] by [[Comcast]] is an example of backward vertical integration. For example, in the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].\n\n==Three types of vertical integration==\nContrary to [[horizontal integration]], which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g., growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or [[retailing]]).  Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers.\n\nThere are three varieties of vertical integration: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration.\n*A company exhibits '''backward vertical integration''' when it controls [[subsidiaries]] that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products. For example, an automobile company may own a [[tire]] company, a [[glass]] company, and a metal company. Control of these three subsidiaries is intended to create a stable supply of inputs and ensure a consistent quality in their final product. It was the main business approach of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and other car companies in the 1920s, who sought to minimize costs by integrating the production of cars and car parts, as exemplified in the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]].\n*A company tends toward '''forward vertical integration''' when it controls distribution centers and retailers where its products are sold. An example is a brewing company that owns and controls a number of bars or pubs.\n\n[[Disintermediation]] is a form of vertical integration when purchasing departments take over the former role of wholesalers to source products.<ref name=\"maninn\">{{cite book |title=Management Innovation: Essays in the Spirit of Alfred D.

For example, fish caught a few days previously that were kept in ice remained in perfect condition.\n\nIn 1924, Clarence Birdseye patented the \"Birdseye Plate Froster\" and established the General Seafood Corporation. In 1929, Birdseye's company and the patent were bought by [[Post Consumer Brands|Postum Cereals]] and [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation]]. It was later known as [[General Foods]]. They kept the Birdseye name, which was split into two words (Birds eye) for use as a trademark. Birdseye was paid $20 million for the patents and $2 million for the assets.\n\nBirds Eye was one of the pioneers in the [[frozen food]] industry. During these times, there was not a well-developed infrastructure to produce and sell frozen foods. Hence Birds Eye developed its own system by using vertical integration. Members of the supply chain, such as farmers and small food retailers, couldn't afford the high cost of equipment, so Birdseye provided it to them.\n\nUntil now, Birds Eye has faded slowly because they have fixed costs associated with vertical integration, such as property, plants, and equipment that cannot be reduced significantly when production needs decrease. The Birds Eye company used vertical integration to create a larger organization structure with more levels of command. This produced a slower information processing rate, with the side effect of making the company so slow that it couldn't react quickly. Birds Eye didn't take advantage of the growth of supermarkets until ten years after the competition did. The already-developed infrastructure did not allow Birdseye to quickly react to market changes.\n\n===Alibaba===\nIn order to increase profits and gain more market share, [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], a China-based company, has implemented vertical integration deepening its company holdings to more than the e-commerce platform. Alibaba has built its leadership in the market by gradually acquiring complementary companies in a variety of industries including delivery and payments.\n\n===Steel and oil===\nOne of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the [[Carnegie Steel]] company. The company controlled not only the mills where the [[steel]] was made, but also the mines where the [[iron ore]] was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the [[coal]], the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens where the coal was coked, etc. The company focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies.<ref>Folsom, Burton ''The Myth of the Robber Barons'' 5th edition. 2007. pg. 65. {{ISBN|978-0963020314}}. \"only we can develop ''ability'' and hold it in our service.

Paramount Pictures, Inc., 1948).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oba | first1 = Goro | last2 = Chan-Olmstead | first2 = Sylvia | year = 2006 | title = Self-Dealing or Market Transaction?: An Exploratory Study of Vertical Integration in the U.S. Television Syndication Market | url = | journal = Journal of Media Economics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 99\u2013118 | doi=10.1207/s15327736me1902_2}}</ref> The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} and modified criteria in financing.

Additionally, Bell and Rogers own wireless providers, [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Rogers Wireless]], while Comcast is partnered with [[Verizon Wireless]] for an Xfinity-branded [[mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]]. Similarly, [[Sony]] has media holdings through its [[Sony Pictures]] division, including film and television content, as well as television channels, but is also a manufacturer of [[consumer electronic]]s that can be used to consume content from itself and others, including televisions, phones, and [[PlayStation]] video game consoles. AT&T is the first ever vertical integration where a mobile phone company and a film studio company are under same umbrella.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{further | Meat industry}}\nVertical integration through production and marketing contracts have also become the dominant model for [[livestock]] production. Currently, 90% of poultry, 69% of hogs, and 29% of cattle are contractually produced through vertical integration.<ref name=\"livestock\">Paul Stokstad, Enforcing Environmental Law in an Unequal Market: The Case of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, 15 Mo.

Farm contracts contain detailed conditions for growers, who are paid based on how efficiently they use feed, provided by the integrator, to raise the animals. The contract dictates how to construct the facilities, how to feed, house, and medicate the animals, and how to handle manure and dispose of carcasses. Generally, the contract also shields the integrator from liability.<ref name=\"livestock\" /> [[Jim Hightower]], in his book, ''Eat Your Heart Out'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Eat_Your_Heart_Out.html?id=qaxIAAAAYAAJ |title=Eat Your Heart Out: Food Profiteering in America - Jim Hightower - Google Books |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2015-04-24|isbn=9780517524541 |last1=Hightower |first1=Jim }}</ref> discusses this liability role enacted by large food companies. He finds that in many cases of agricultural vertical integration, the integrator ([[food company]]) denies the farmer the right of entrepreneurship. This means that the farmer can only sell ''under'' and ''to'' the integrator. These restrictions on specified growth, [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] argues, strips the selling and producing power of the farmer. The producer is ultimately limited by the established standards of the integrator. Yet, at the same time, the integrator still keeps the responsibility connected to the farmer. [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] sees this as ownership without reliability.<ref>Hightower, Jim.

The intermediate product can only be produced with the help of specific physical assets (e.g., machines, buildings). Should the buyer own the assets (vertical integration) or should the seller own the assets (non-integration)? Suppose that today the parties have to make relationship-specific investments. Since today complete contracts cannot be written, the two parties will negotiate tomorrow about how to divide the returns of the investments. Since the owner is in a better bargaining position, he will have stronger incentives to invest. Hence, whether vertical integration is desirable or not depends on whose investments are more important. Hart's theory has been extended by several authors.

Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different [[product (business)|product]] or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need. It is contrasted with [[horizontal integration]], wherein a company produces several items that are related to one another. Vertical integration has also described [[management style]]s that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership but also into one [[corporation]] (as in the 1920s when the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] began making much of its own steel rather than buying it from suppliers).\n\nVertical integration and expansion is desired because it secures supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Vertical integration and expansion can become undesirable when its actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace. Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the [[hold-up problem]]. A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a ''vertical monopoly''.\n\n==Vertical expansion==\nVertical integration is often closely associated to vertical expansion which, in [[economics]], is the growth of a business enterprise through the [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product. Such expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the [[business|firm]] to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Such expansion can become undesirable when its actions become [[anti-competitive]] and impede free competition in an open marketplace.\n\nThe result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits. On the undesirable side, when vertical expansion leads toward [[monopoly|monopolistic]] control of a product or service then regulative action may be required to rectify anti-competitive behavior. Related to vertical expansion is [[lateral expansion]], which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving [[economies of scale]].\n\nVertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition. Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase scales and to gain market power. The acquisition of [[DirecTV]] by [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] is an example of forward vertical expansion or acquisition. DirecTV is a [[satellite TV]] company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies and television shows. The acquisition of [[NBC]] by [[Comcast]] is an example of backward vertical integration. For example, in the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].\n\n==Three types of vertical integration==\nContrary to [[horizontal integration]], which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g., growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or [[retailing]]).  Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers.\n\nThere are three varieties of vertical integration: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration.\n*A company exhibits '''backward vertical integration''' when it controls [[subsidiaries]] that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products. For example, an automobile company may own a [[tire]] company, a [[glass]] company, and a metal company.

In 1929, Birdseye's company and the patent were bought by [[Post Consumer Brands|Postum Cereals]] and [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation]]. It was later known as [[General Foods]]. They kept the Birdseye name, which was split into two words (Birds eye) for use as a trademark. Birdseye was paid $20 million for the patents and $2 million for the assets.\n\nBirds Eye was one of the pioneers in the [[frozen food]] industry. During these times, there was not a well-developed infrastructure to produce and sell frozen foods. Hence Birds Eye developed its own system by using vertical integration. Members of the supply chain, such as farmers and small food retailers, couldn't afford the high cost of equipment, so Birdseye provided it to them.\n\nUntil now, Birds Eye has faded slowly because they have fixed costs associated with vertical integration, such as property, plants, and equipment that cannot be reduced significantly when production needs decrease. The Birds Eye company used vertical integration to create a larger organization structure with more levels of command. This produced a slower information processing rate, with the side effect of making the company so slow that it couldn't react quickly. Birds Eye didn't take advantage of the growth of supermarkets until ten years after the competition did. The already-developed infrastructure did not allow Birdseye to quickly react to market changes.\n\n===Alibaba===\nIn order to increase profits and gain more market share, [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], a China-based company, has implemented vertical integration deepening its company holdings to more than the e-commerce platform. Alibaba has built its leadership in the market by gradually acquiring complementary companies in a variety of industries including delivery and payments.\n\n===Steel and oil===\nOne of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the [[Carnegie Steel]] company. The company controlled not only the mills where the [[steel]] was made, but also the mines where the [[iron ore]] was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the [[coal]], the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens where the coal was coked, etc. The company focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies.<ref>Folsom, Burton ''The Myth of the Robber Barons'' 5th edition. 2007. pg. 65. {{ISBN|978-0963020314}}. \"only we can develop ''ability'' and hold it in our service. Every year should be marked by the promotion of one or more of our young men.\"</ref>{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}} Later, Carnegie established [[Carnegie Institute of Technology|an institute]] of higher learning to teach the steel processes to the next generation.\n\n[[Petroleum industry|Oil companies]], both multinational (such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[ConocoPhillips]] or [[BP]]) and national (e.g., [[Petronas]]) often adopt a vertically integrated structure, meaning that they are active along the entire supply chain from [[Hydrocarbon exploration|locating deposits]], drilling and extracting [[crude oil]], transporting it around the world, [[Oil refinery|refining]] it into petroleum products such as [[gasoline|petrol/gasoline]], to distributing the fuel to company-owned retail stations, for sale to consumers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Standard Oil]] is a famous example of both horizontal and vertical integration, combining extraction, transport, refinement, wholesale distribution, and retail sales at company-owned gas stations.\n\n===Telecommunications and computing===\nTelephone companies in most of the 20th century, especially the largest (the [[Bell System]]) were integrated, making their own [[telephone]]s, [[telephone cable]]s, [[telephone exchange]] equipment and other supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://en.wikipedia.org/&httpsredir=1&article=3641&context=clr |title=Vertical Integration and the Communication Equipment Industry Alternatives for Public Policy |last=Irwin |first=Manley |date=February 3, 1968 |website=scholarship.law.cornell.edu |access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\nFrom the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American [[motion picture]] had evolved into an industry controlled by a few companies, a condition known as a \"mature [[oligopoly]]\", as it was led by eight [[major film studio]]s, the most powerful of which were the \"Big Five\" studios: [[MGM]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[RKO]].<ref name=\"Alberti2014\">{{cite book|author=John Alberti|title=Screen Ages: A Survey of American Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J06cBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA108|date=27 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-65028-7|pages=108\u2013}}</ref> These studios were fully integrated, not only producing and distributing films, but also operating their own [[movie theater]]s; the \"Little Three\", [[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[United Artists]], produced and distributed feature films but did not own theaters.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe issue of vertical integration (also known as common ownership) has been the main focus of policy makers because of the possibility of anti-competitive behaviors affiliated with market influence. For example, in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court ordered the five vertically integrated studios to sell off their theater chains and all trade practices were prohibited (United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 1948).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oba | first1 = Goro | last2 = Chan-Olmstead | first2 = Sylvia | year = 2006 | title = Self-Dealing or Market Transaction?: An Exploratory Study of Vertical Integration in the U.S. Television Syndication Market | url = | journal = Journal of Media Economics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 99\u2013118 | doi=10.1207/s15327736me1902_2}}</ref> The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} and modified criteria in financing. Networks began arranging content initiated by commonly owned studios and stipulated a portion of the syndication revenues in order for a show to gain a spot on the schedule if it was produced by a studio without common ownership.<ref>[[Amanda D. Lotz|Lotz, Amanda D.]] (2007) \"The Television Will Be Revolutionized\". New York, NY: New York University Press. p.87</ref> In response, the studios fundamentally changed the way they made movies and did business. Lacking the financial resources and contract talent they once controlled, the studios now relied on independent producers supplying some portion of the budget in exchange for distribution rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=McDonald, P.|author2=Wasko, J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Australia|isbn=9781405133876|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contemporaryholl0000unse/page/14 14\u201317]|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryholl0000unse/page/14}}</ref>\n\nCertain [[media conglomerates]] may, in a similar manner, own television broadcasters (either over-the-air or on cable), production companies that produce content for their networks, and also own the services that distribute their content to viewers (such as television and internet service providers). [[AT&T]], [[Bell Canada]], [[Comcast]], [[Sky plc]], and [[Rogers Communications]] are vertically integrated in such a manner{{emdash}}operating media subsidiaries (such as [[WarnerMedia]], [[Bell Media]], [[NBCUniversal]], and [[Rogers Media]]), and provide \"[[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]\" services of television, internet, and phone service in some markets (such as [[Bell TV]]/[[Bell Internet]], [[Rogers Cable]], [[Xfinity]], and Sky's satellite TV and internet services). Additionally, Bell and Rogers own wireless providers, [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Rogers Wireless]], while Comcast is partnered with [[Verizon Wireless]] for an Xfinity-branded [[mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]]. Similarly, [[Sony]] has media holdings through its [[Sony Pictures]] division, including film and television content, as well as television channels, but is also a manufacturer of [[consumer electronic]]s that can be used to consume content from itself and others, including televisions, phones, and [[PlayStation]] video game consoles. AT&T is the first ever vertical integration where a mobile phone company and a film studio company are under same umbrella.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{further | Meat industry}}\nVertical integration through production and marketing contracts have also become the dominant model for [[livestock]] production. Currently, 90% of poultry, 69% of hogs, and 29% of cattle are contractually produced through vertical integration.<ref name=\"livestock\">Paul Stokstad, Enforcing Environmental Law in an Unequal Market: The Case of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, 15 Mo. Envtl. L. & Pol\u2019y Rev. 229, 234-36 (Spring 2008)</ref> The USDA supports vertical integration because it has increased food productivity. However, \"... contractors receive a large share of farm receipts, formerly assumed to go to the operator's family\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aer-agricultural-economic-report/aer747.aspx#.UpaBmsRONqU |title=USDA ERS - Farmers' Use of Marketing and Production Contracts |publisher=Ers.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}</ref>\n\nUnder production contracts, growers raise animals owned by integrators. Farm contracts contain detailed conditions for growers, who are paid based on how efficiently they use feed, provided by the integrator, to raise the animals. The contract dictates how to construct the facilities, how to feed, house, and medicate the animals, and how to handle manure and dispose of carcasses. Generally, the contract also shields the integrator from liability.<ref name=\"livestock\" /> [[Jim Hightower]], in his book, ''Eat Your Heart Out'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Eat_Your_Heart_Out.html?id=qaxIAAAAYAAJ |title=Eat Your Heart Out: Food Profiteering in America - Jim Hightower - Google Books |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2015-04-24|isbn=9780517524541 |last1=Hightower |first1=Jim }}</ref> discusses this liability role enacted by large food companies. He finds that in many cases of agricultural vertical integration, the integrator ([[food company]]) denies the farmer the right of entrepreneurship. This means that the farmer can only sell ''under'' and ''to'' the integrator. These restrictions on specified growth, [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] argues, strips the selling and producing power of the farmer. The producer is ultimately limited by the established standards of the integrator. Yet, at the same time, the integrator still keeps the responsibility connected to the farmer. [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] sees this as ownership without reliability.<ref>Hightower, Jim. ''Eat Your Heart Out'', 1975, Crown Publishing. pg 162-168, {{ISBN|978-0517524541}}</ref>\n\nUnder marketing contracts, growers agree in advance to sell their animals to integrators under an agreed price system. Generally, these contracts shield the integrator from liability for the grower's actions and the only negotiable item is a price.<ref name=\"livestock\" />\n\n===Automotive industry===\nIn the United States new automobiles can not be sold at dealerships owned by the same company that produced them but are protected by state franchise laws.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Surowiecki | first = James | date = September 4, 2006 | title = Dealer's Choice | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/dealers-choice-2 | magazine = The New Yorker | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Eyewear===\n[[Luxottica]] owns 80% of the market share of companies that produce corrective and protective [[eyewear]] as well as owning many retailers, optical departments at [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Sears]], and key eye insurance groups, such as [[EyeMed]].<ref name=\"SIXTYMINUTES2012\">{{cite news|title=Sticker shock: Why are glasses so expensive?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57527151/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive/|newspaper=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | last = Goodman | first = Andrew | date = July 16, 2014 | title = There's More to Ray-Ban and Oakley Than Meets the Eye | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/agoodman/2014/07/16/theres-more-to-ray-ban-and-oakley-than-meets-the-eye/ | magazine = Forbes | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | last = Swanson | first = Ana | date = September 10, 2014 | title = Meet the Four-Eyed, Eight-Tentacled Monopoly That is Making Your Glasses So Expensive | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/anaswanson/2014/09/10/meet-the-four-eyed-eight-tentacled-monopoly-that-is-making-your-glasses-so-expensive/#2adff9764dc8 | magazine = Forbes | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Health care===\nIn the United States, major vertical mergers have included [[CVS Health]]'s purchase of [[Aetna]], and [[Cigna]]'s purchase of [[Express Scripts]].\n\n===General retail===\n[[Amazon.com]] has been criticized for being anti-competitive as both a [[Criticism of Amazon#Marketplace participant and owner|owner and participant]] of its dominant online marketplace.

The intermediate product can only be produced with the help of specific physical assets (e.g., machines, buildings). Should the buyer own the assets (vertical integration) or should the seller own the assets (non-integration)? Suppose that today the parties have to make relationship-specific investments. Since today complete contracts cannot be written, the two parties will negotiate tomorrow about how to divide the returns of the investments. Since the owner is in a better bargaining position, he will have stronger incentives to invest. Hence, whether vertical integration is desirable or not depends on whose investments are more important. Hart's theory has been extended by several authors. For instance, DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have studied different bargaining games,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Meza|first=D.|last2=Lockwood|first2=B.|date=1998|title=Does Asset Ownership Always Motivate Managers?
