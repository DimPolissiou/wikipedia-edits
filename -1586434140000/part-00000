Since the early 14th century, it has joined eastward to the [[estuary]] of the river [[Weser]]. For some time, there were three permanent connecting branches and one flood bed between the river and the bight, forming an [[River delta#Tide-dominated deltas|estuarine delta]]. The first of these junctions was closed in 1450 by [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and the last one in 1515. However, about a century passed before most of the area flooded by these connections was regained for pasture and arable land.\n\nIn the west, the Jade extended far into the [[East Frisia|Frisian peninsula]]. From the early 16th century, a number of dikes were built against the storm floods and to gain arable land. The main dike, ''Ellenser Damm'', was built between 1596 and 1615 by the [[Duchy of Oldenburg|County of Oldenburg]] before the agreement with the objecting [[County of East Frisia]] was finished successfully.\n\n==Decay of the Frisian community==\nThe extension of Jade Bight and its branches fragmented the free [[Frisians|Frisian]] territory of [[R\u00fcstringen]] in ''Bant'' in the northwest, most of which has disappeared in the waves, ''Bovenjadingen'' ('above the Jade') with the low [[moraine]] hills of [[Friesische Wehde]] in the southwest, [[Butjadingen]] ('outside the Jade') in the northeast, which was an island for almost two centuries, and ''[[Stadland]]'' ('bank-land'), which became a narrow island along the left bank of the Weser in 1384. The devastation by floods and the losses of land weakened the Frisian community. In the years about 1400, the [[Free City of Bremen]] tried to rule Standland and Butjadingen. At the beginning of 16th century, all countries around Jade Bight were conquered by the Counts of Oldenburg.\n\n==Organized construction of dikes==\nTogether with the conquest of the island of Stadland, the [[Lockfleth]], the largest branch of the Weser delta, was interrupted by a dike at [[Ovelg\u00f6nne]] in 1515. In the next years the water course was cut off at more sites. The most important projects prior to 1650 were the Ellenser Damm across the Schwarzes Brack in the west of the bay in 1596 to 1615 and the New Hoben-Dike in the east in 1643. South of this dike, the coast became a mossy bog. The bog was affected by high floods, and dikes built on the bog proved to be very fragile.\n\n==Harbour==\n[[Tide|Tidal]] flows make the neck of Jade Bight the deepest natural channel near Germany's North Sea coast. In 1853, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] bought a part of the western shore of the bay from Oldenburg, in order to use the harbour as a Prussian naval base, later called [[Wilhelmshaven]]. During [[World War I]], the German [[High Seas Fleet]] (''Hochseeflotte''), the main battle fleet of the Imperial German Navy (''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]''), was based at Wilhelmshaven in the Jade Bight.

A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the [[viscosity]] of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses [[glycerine]] or [[golden syrup]] as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. Several school experiments often involve varying the temperature and/or concentration of the substances used in order to demonstrate the effects this has on the viscosity. Industrial methods include many different [[oil]]s, and [[polymer]] liquids such as solutions.\n\nThe importance of Stokes law is illustrated by the fact that it played a critical role in the research leading to at least three Nobel Prizes.<ref>Dusenbery, David B.

Requiring the force balance ''F<sub>d</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F<sub>g</sub>'' and solving for the velocity ''v'' gives the terminal velocity ''v<sub>s</sub>''. Note that since the excess force increases as ''R<sup>3</sup>'' and Stokes' drag increases as ''R'', the terminal velocity increases as ''R<sup>2</sup>'' and thus varies greatly with particle size as shown below. If a particle only experiences its own weight while falling in a viscous fluid, then a terminal velocity is reached when the sum of the frictional and the [[buoyant force]]s on the particle due to the fluid exactly balances the [[gravitational force]].

[[Level set | Isocontours]] of the ''\u03c8'' function (values in contour labels).]]\n\nFor the case of a sphere in a uniform [[far field]] flow, it is advantageous to use a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] (&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;,&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;,&nbsp;''z''&nbsp;). The ''z''\u2013axis is through the centre of the sphere and aligned with the mean flow direction, while ''r'' is the radius as measured perpendicular to the ''z''\u2013axis. The [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] is at the sphere centre.

A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the [[viscosity]] of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses [[glycerine]] or [[golden syrup]] as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. Several school experiments often involve varying the temperature and/or concentration of the substances used in order to demonstrate the effects this has on the viscosity. Industrial methods include many different [[oil]]s, and [[polymer]] liquids such as solutions.\n\nThe importance of Stokes law is illustrated by the fact that it played a critical role in the research leading to at least three Nobel Prizes.<ref>Dusenbery, David B.

He was Canada's fifth-highest scoring ace of the war. McKnight joined the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in early 1939 and served in [[No. 242 Squadron RAF]] during the final phase of the [[Battle of France]], covering the Allied retreat from [[Brittany]], and later the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\nMcKnight's aircraft wore a distinct cartoon of a [[jackboot]] kicking [[Adolf Hitler]] on the port side of the engine cowling. His Hurricane also carried a human skeleton image which held a sickle in its hand under the cockpit, on both sides of the aircraft.<ref>Holmes 1998, pp. 98, 124.</ref> McKnight scored 17 victories, as well as two shared and three unconfirmed kills. McKnight was shot down and killed on 12 January 1941 during a fighter sweep over Calais.<ref name=\"Holmes 1998, p. 124\">Holmes 1998, p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam Lidstone \"Willie\" McKnight was born in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada on 18 November 1918 and grew up in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]]. He was considered a bit of a character at school and showed a rebellious streak. At Crescent Heights High School, he quarterbacked the football team but was renowned for once crashing his father's car into a neighbour's fence while trying to impress a new girlfriend.\n\nIn 1939, after entering the medical school at the University of Alberta, McKnight continued his cockiness but was on the verge of expulsion when a [[United Kingdom|British]] recruiting mission for the [[Royal Air Force]] arrived in Calgary. Seeing a chance for adventure as well as leaving behind a turbulent romance with his girlfriend Marian, he enlisted as a prospective fighter pilot in February 1939 and sailed for England.\n\n==Second World War==\nCommissioned in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and appointed acting pilot officer on probation (41937), 15 April 1939, McKnight began training at No. 6 Flying Training School (FTS), Little Rissington, Bourton-on-the-Water, Cheltenham.<ref name= \"Ralph\">Ralph 2005, p. 67.</ref> While in training, he was nearly incorrigible, being confined to his barracks twice (for a fortnight) and, along with a classmate, being placed on open arrest as \"perpetrators of a riot.\"<ref name= \"Ralph\"/> Highjinks soon came to an end when Germany invaded Poland and the recruits in training were hurriedly graduated as fighter pilots.\n\nMcKnight was posted to No. 242 Squadron on 6 May 1940. The squadron had reformed on 30 October 1939 at [[RAF Church Fenton]] and initially had a large number of Canadian personnel on strength. The first aircraft assigned to the squadron were [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim MK 1F]] twin-engine fighters but replacement [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters were sent in January 1940. After transitioning to the more potent Hurricane, the squadron became operational on 24 March 1940.\n\n===Battle of France===\nAs part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), McKnight and 242 Squadron began operations over France on 14 May, a detachment being based at French airfields. With the squadron partly stationed in England in reserve, four individual pilots (with six more following) were attached to other BEF units. McKnight flew with No. 615 Squadron at [[Abbeville, France]], but the constant retreats necessitated three new relocations in six days. In typical McKnight style, he commandeered a limousine that had been abandoned by a \"brass hat\" and carried on a romantic encounter with a Parisienne (whom he eventually tried to smuggle back to England in a transport).\n\nOn 19 May 1940, McKnight scored his first victory while on an evening patrol over [[Cambrai, France|Cambrai]]. The four patrolling Hurricanes were \"bounced\" by two groups of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s totaling 19 enemy fighters. Flying as the \"tail-end Charlie,\" McKnight shouted a warning and wheeled into a steep climbing turn that brought him on the tail of one of the diving Bf 109s, which he shot down, his squadron's first kill over France.\n\nOn 21 May 242 Squadron pilots were withdrawn to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] essentially to begin a seven days' leave which was abruptly cut short after 48 hours when was the retreating BEF and allied armies were pushed into [[Dunkirk]]. The squadron was rushed to [[RAF Manston]] and operated out of French airfields during daylight hours but returning in the evening. As fierce fighting over Dunkirk took place, McKnight claimed a victory over a Bf 109 on 28 May but his Hurricane was hit, and he had to limp home with his oil and coolant systems shot up. Over Dunkirk, in four days, McKnight shot down six enemy aircraft, eventually claiming 10 victories by 7 June 1940.<ref>Holmes 1998, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe constant combat had been telling on McKnight and he was admitted to hospital in July 1940 to recuperate. He had lost {{convert|27|lb|abbr=on}} in weight and was clearly suffering from sleep deprivation as well as a host of other ailments including stomach problems. While in hospital, he openly fretted over a squadron mate, P/O [[Stan Turner (RAF)|Stan Turner]] overhauling him as the top scorer.\n[[File:McKnight's plane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|\"Willie\" McKnight's Hurricane Mk I]]\n\n===Battle of Britain===\nNo. 242 Squadron was badly mauled over France, losing 11 pilots and was reassembled at Coltishall with a new commanding officer, Squadron Leader [[Douglas Bader]]. In 242, he saw a squadron that needed to be \"whipped back into shape\" and he proceeded to establish his brand, selecting new flight commanders, requisitioning new equipment and eventually winning the approval of every squadron member, especially \"Willie\" McKnight. Bader saw his top ace as a surrogate son and chose him as a wingman.<ref>Shores and Williams 1994, p. 437.</ref>\n\nBy mid-July, 242 was declared operational again and joined No. 12 Group, Fighter Command. Throughout July and August although the Battle of Britain had raged over England, the industrial Midlands which the squadron patrolled did not receive heavy attacks. On 30 August 1940, the squadron relocated to [[RAF Duxford]] and was involved in action when a large formation of He 111s with Bf 109 and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] escorts was intercepted on a raid against [[RAF North Weald]]. Bader scored two victories while his \"wingman\" claimed two enemy Bf 110s and a He 111.\n\nOn 9 September, McKnight scored twice when enemy raiders were intercepted by a group of three squadrons that were coordinated into a single unit by Bader as part of his \"Big Wing\" plan. While trying to split the escorting fighters from the bombers, McKnight's Hurricane (bearing his irreverent individual marking of a death's head skull and skeleton with a sickle) was hit and one aileron was shot away. He barely made it back to his home base.\n\nAnother two kills took place on 18 September when McKnight brought down a [[Dornier Do 17]] and shared in the destruction of a [[Junkers Ju 88]]. His final victory was over the Thames Estuary on 5 November 1940, McKnight disabled a Bf 109, pulling close and motioning for the enemy fighter pilot to lower his undercarriage in a sign of defeat. Instead the pilot (Fw Scheidt of [[Jagdgeschwader 26]]) bailed out over the Thames.\n\nPromoted to flying officer, McKnight was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 30 August 1940 and a Bar in September 1940.\n\n==Death==\nNo. 242 Squadron was relocated to Coltishall in November 1940, followed by a further move to Martlesham Heath in December. On 12 January 1941, the squadron began a series of offensive sorties against targets in France, first acting as escorts for Blenheim bombers then beginning on 12 January, the first of the \"Rhubarbs,\" low-level intruder attacks on targets of opportunity.\n\nWhile strafing an E-boat in the English Channel, P/O M.K. Brown accompanying McKnight, broke off as the duo were under fire from anti-aircraft fire from the French coast just as a Bf 109 attacked. Brown made it back home but McKnight was listed as \"missing.\" Recent research suggests McKnight fell to Fw. Brugelmann of [[Jagdgeschwader 26]] (three kills). Bader was distraught at the loss of McKnight and vowed revenge, but 242's \"top gun\" was never found. Fellow Canadian ace [[Pilot Officer]] John B. Latta (seven kills and one shared) was also killed on this day.<ref name=\"Holmes 1998, p. 124\"/>\n\nBefore his death in January 1941, McKnight had 17 kills, two shared and three unconfirmed credited to his score. Following is a list of victories:\n* 19 May 1940: one Bf 109\n* 28 May 1940: one Bf 109\n* 29 May 1940: two Bf 109s (one unconfirmed) and one Do 17\n* 31 May 1940: two Bf 110's and a Bf 109\n* 1 June 1940: shot down two Stukas (two more unconfirmed)\n* 30 August 1940: two Bf 110s and a He 111\n* 9 September 1940: two Bf 110s\n* 18 September 1940: one Do 17 and a half Ju 88\n* 5 November 1940: shot down one Bf 109\n\nFlying Officer McKnight has no known grave; his name is inscribed on the [[Air Forces Memorial|Runnymede Memorial]], [[Englefield Green]], [[Egham]], [[Surrey]], United Kingdom.\n\nCalgary's McKnight Boulevard is named after him.<ref>[[McKnight Boulevard]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n[http://acesofww2.com/Canada/aces/mcknight/  Willie McKnight at acesofww2.com]\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Halliday, Hugh.

McKnight joined the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in early 1939 and served in [[No. 242 Squadron RAF]] during the final phase of the [[Battle of France]], covering the Allied retreat from [[Brittany]], and later the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\nMcKnight's aircraft wore a distinct cartoon of a [[jackboot]] kicking [[Adolf Hitler]] on the port side of the engine cowling. His Hurricane also carried a human skeleton image which held a sickle in its hand under the cockpit, on both sides of the aircraft.<ref>Holmes 1998, pp. 98, 124.</ref> McKnight scored 17 victories, as well as two shared and three unconfirmed kills.

Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]].

''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]].

Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s.

(whose mother had converted and brought Catholicism to what became the Diocese of [[Gar\u00f0ar, Greenland]]), his sister and at least two brothers, according to the [[Vinland Sagas]]. Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]]. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi'kma'ki by learning the local language and living alongside the [[Mi'kmaq]] in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]].

Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s.
