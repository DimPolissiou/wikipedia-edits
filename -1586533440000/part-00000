It is also known as a ''tilt indicator'', ''tilt sensor'', [[tiltmeter|''tilt meter'']],  ''slope alert'', ''slope gauge'', ''gradient meter'', ''gradiometer'', ''level gauge'', ''level meter'', ''declinometer'', and ''pitch & roll indicator''. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: [[degree (angle)|degrees]], [[percent]], and topo (see [[Grade (slope)]] for details). [[Astrolabes]] are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.\n\nA ''tilt sensor'' can measure the [[wikt:tilt|tilting]] in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes.\nIn contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth's ground plane, is to use an [[accelerometer]]. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the \"ball\" in [[turn coordinator]]s or [[turn and bank indicator]]s is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Eclimetro (disegno) IF 24935.jpg|thumb|Drawing of an inclinometer, Museo Galileo, Florence.]]\nInclinometers include examples such as Well's in-clinometer, the essential parts of which are a flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disc just half filled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb. Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple [[conversion tables]], the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line.\n\n[[Image:Well's Clinometer - Project Gutenberg eText 19465.png|thumb|The Well's clinometer]]\n\nThe [[Abney level]] is a handheld [[surveying]] instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its [[crosshair]]) with the reflection of the bubble in the [[spirit level]] of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.\n\nOne of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP \"The Spirit of St. Louis\"\u2014in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riekerinc.com/M-Inclinometer/ryan_nyp_spirit_of_st.htm|title=Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer|author=|date=|website=riekerinc.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> to give him climb and descent angle information.\n\n==Uses==\nHand-held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for [[cave survey]]. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the [[strike and dip]] of geologic formations.  In forestry, [[tree height measurement]] can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major [[artillery]] guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances.\n\nPermanently-installed [[tiltmeter]]s are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure.\n\n[[Image:Measuring Slope With a Clinometer 2.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Measuring slope with a clinometer]]\n\n===Factors which influence the use of inclinometers===\n(Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used)\n* Gravity\n* Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration.\n* A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed.\n* A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision.\n* The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec.\n\n==Accuracy==\nCertain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001\u00b0; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.01\u00b0. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity\u2014electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from \u00b10.01\u20132\u00b0 depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Clinometerlow.jpg|Simple clinometer\nFile:Digital protractor.jpg|Digital protractor\nFile:Vickers Clino R.JPG|Clinometer designed to enable [[indirect fire]] capability with a [[Vickers machine gun]] circa 1918\nFile:Breithaupt Kassel 25704-271300.01.0 clinometer DSC03651.JPG|Mechanical spirit level clinometer with micrometer adjustment\n</gallery>\n\n==Sensor technology==\nTilt sensors and inclinometers generate an [[artificial horizon]] and measure angular tilt with respect to this horizon. They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt.\n\nImportant specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, [[orthogonal]]. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. <!-- doesn't matter what it's measured in, and last sentence just repeats the back end of the first -->\n\nCommon implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, [[Liquid capacitive inclinometers|Liquid Capacitive]], electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum.\n\nTilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' and ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games.\n\nInclinometers are also used in [[civil engineering]], for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon.\n\nSome inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on [[Controller area network|CAN (Controller Area Network)]]. In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized [[Canopen|CANopen]] profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable.\n\n==Two-axis digital inclinometer==\n[[File:DWL-8500.jpg|thumb|Two-axis digital inclinometer]]\n\nTraditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum.\n\nTypical advantages of using two-axis [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inclinometers over conventional single-axis \"bubble\" or mechanical leveling instruments may include:\n* Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch & roll), can eliminate tedious swopping back-and-forth experienced when using a single-axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position.\n* Digital compensation and precise calibration for non-linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range.\n* The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure's positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up.\n\n== Inclinometer with [[gyroscope]] ==\nAs inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the above-mentioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.posital.com/en/products/inclinometers/mems/MEMS-Technology.php|title=MEMS Inclinometer from POSITAL: How do they work?|last=POSITAL|website=Posital|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Inclinometer.svg|thumb|100px|Symbol used in geotechnical drawings]]\nInclinometers are used for:\n* Determining latitude using [[Polaris]] (in the Northern Hemisphere) or the two stars of the constellation [[Crux]] (in the Southern Hemisphere).\n* Determining the angle of the Earth's magnetic field with respect to the horizontal plane.\n* Showing a deviation from the true vertical or horizontal.\n* [[Surveying]], to measure an angle of inclination or elevation.\n* Alerting an equipment operator that it may tip over.\n* Measuring angles of elevation, slope, or incline, e.g. of an embankment.\n* Measuring slight differences in slopes, particularly for [[geophysics]].

The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature:\n* ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' (Game Boy Advance)\n* ''[[WarioWare: Twisted!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(not released in Europe)\n* ''[[Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(Japan only)\n* ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' ([[Game Boy Color]])(not released in Europe)\n* [[Command Master]] ([[Game Boy Color]])(Japan only)\n\nTilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the [[Microsoft Sidewinder]] Freestyle Pro and Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] controller.\n\nHowever, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]] and the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk attachment]]. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most [[Wii]] games.\n\nIt is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like [[motocross]]ing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, [[first-person shooter]], and other odd uses such as in ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]''\n\nAnother example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze.

Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple [[conversion tables]], the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line.\n\n[[Image:Well's Clinometer - Project Gutenberg eText 19465.png|thumb|The Well's clinometer]]\n\nThe [[Abney level]] is a handheld [[surveying]] instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its [[crosshair]]) with the reflection of the bubble in the [[spirit level]] of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.\n\nOne of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP \"The Spirit of St. Louis\"\u2014in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riekerinc.com/M-Inclinometer/ryan_nyp_spirit_of_st.htm|title=Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer|author=|date=|website=riekerinc.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> to give him climb and descent angle information.\n\n==Uses==\nHand-held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for [[cave survey]]. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the [[strike and dip]] of geologic formations.  In forestry, [[tree height measurement]] can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major [[artillery]] guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances.\n\nPermanently-installed [[tiltmeter]]s are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure.\n\n[[Image:Measuring Slope With a Clinometer 2.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Measuring slope with a clinometer]]\n\n===Factors which influence the use of inclinometers===\n(Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used)\n* Gravity\n* Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration.\n* A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed.\n* A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision.\n* The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec.\n\n==Accuracy==\nCertain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001\u00b0; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.01\u00b0. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity\u2014electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from \u00b10.01\u20132\u00b0 depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Clinometerlow.jpg|Simple clinometer\nFile:Digital protractor.jpg|Digital protractor\nFile:Vickers Clino R.JPG|Clinometer designed to enable [[indirect fire]] capability with a [[Vickers machine gun]] circa 1918\nFile:Breithaupt Kassel 25704-271300.01.0 clinometer DSC03651.JPG|Mechanical spirit level clinometer with micrometer adjustment\n</gallery>\n\n==Sensor technology==\nTilt sensors and inclinometers generate an [[artificial horizon]] and measure angular tilt with respect to this horizon. They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt.\n\nImportant specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, [[orthogonal]]. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. <!-- doesn't matter what it's measured in, and last sentence just repeats the back end of the first -->\n\nCommon implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, [[Liquid capacitive inclinometers|Liquid Capacitive]], electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum.\n\nTilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' and ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games.\n\nInclinometers are also used in [[civil engineering]], for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon.\n\nSome inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on [[Controller area network|CAN (Controller Area Network)]]. In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized [[Canopen|CANopen]] profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable.\n\n==Two-axis digital inclinometer==\n[[File:DWL-8500.jpg|thumb|Two-axis digital inclinometer]]\n\nTraditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum.\n\nTypical advantages of using two-axis [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inclinometers over conventional single-axis \"bubble\" or mechanical leveling instruments may include:\n* Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch & roll), can eliminate tedious swopping back-and-forth experienced when using a single-axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position.\n* Digital compensation and precise calibration for non-linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range.\n* The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure's positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up.\n\n== Inclinometer with [[gyroscope]] ==\nAs inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the above mentioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.posital.com/en/products/inclinometers/mems/MEMS-Technology.php|title=MEMS Inclinometer from POSITAL: How do they work?|last=POSITAL|website=Posital|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Inclinometer.svg|thumb|100px|Symbol used in geotechnical drawings]]\nInclinometers are used for:\n* Determining latitude using [[Polaris]] (in the Northern Hemisphere) or the two stars of the constellation [[Crux]] (in the Southern Hemisphere).\n* Determining the angle of the Earth's magnetic field with respect to the horizontal plane.\n* Showing a deviation from the true vertical or horizontal.\n* [[Surveying]], to measure an angle of inclination or elevation.\n* Alerting an equipment operator that it may tip over.\n* Measuring angles of elevation, slope, or incline, e.g. of an embankment.\n* Measuring slight differences in slopes, particularly for [[geophysics]].

The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature:\n* ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' (Game Boy Advance)\n* ''[[WarioWare: Twisted!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(not released in Europe)\n* ''[[Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(Japan only)\n* ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' ([[Game Boy Color]])(not released in Europe)\n* [[Command Master]] ([[Game Boy Color]])(Japan only)\n\nTilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the [[Microsoft Sidewinder]] Freestyle Pro and Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] controller.\n\nHowever, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]] and the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk attachment]]. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most [[Wii]] games.\n\nIt is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like [[motocross]]ing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, [[first-person shooter]], and other odd uses such as in ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]''\n\nAnother example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze. A homebrew tilt sensor interface was made for the [[Palm (PDA)]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Grade (slope)]]\n* [[Liquid capacitive inclinometers]]\n* [[Theodolite]]\n* [[Tiltmeter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Inclinometers}}\n* [http://www.inclinometer.blogspot.com Inclinometer Blog \u2013 General Inclinometer Information]\n* [https://www.posital.com/en/products/inclinometers/mems/MEMS-Technology.php MEMS inclinometer and technical specifications]\n* [https://www.vigordigital.com/Products.html?product_category=28 Inclinometers]\n\n{{Forestry tools}}\n{{Sensors}}\n{{Geotechnical engineering}}\n\n[[Category:Inclinometers| ]]\n[[Category:Dimensional instruments]]\n[[Category:Forestry tools]]\n[[Category:Surveying instruments]]\n\n[[de:Neigungssensor]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: above mentioned \u2192 above-mentioned,  ,  \u2192 ,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclinometer"}

Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems but have a built-in audio announcement system until STARIS was installed and activated around 2010.\n\nUnlike the 66 first generation Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 train sets, the C651s are delivered with a scratch-resistant acrylic finish. This alleviated the difficulty of removing dirt trapped on the exterior surface, as opposed to the aluminium finish of the C151 trains that were delivered unpainted. The train run number at the front of the train was delivered by a low-power consumption electronic green flip-dot display.\n\nThe C651 trains were originally delivered with a GTO-VVVF propulsion system that was supplied by Siemens.\n\nOther original features included specifically designed air-conditioning vents that eliminate dripping from the cooling system to the train compartments, as well as an event recorder, which records important train functions, such as braking and emergency operations to assist troubleshooting in an event of a failure.\n\nThe C651 was also the basis for the [[Taipei Metro C321]] and [[Taipei Metro C341]] built from 1998 to 1999 and 2003 respectively for the [[Taipei Metro]] [[Bannan Line]].\n\n==Operational history==\nThe design and supply of the C651 trains were tendered in December 1992 to complement the 66 first generation [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151|C151]] trains with the opening of the Woodlands extension, at a cost of $259 million. These trains began revenue service from 2 May 1995, with the first train set delivered to the [[SMRT Corporation|Mass Rapid Transit Corporation]] (MRTC) of Singapore on 20 September 1994.\n\n=== Experimental programmes ===\nA number of experimental programmes have been run on the C651 cars.\n\nIn the 2000s, the third and fourth cars, coloured in green had all but eight seats, four at each end of the car, removed completely. In its place was standing room with upholstered cushion, in an attempt to provide a degree of comfort to passengers standing in that space. This design proved to be unpopular with the commuters, and it was eventually dropped. The original seats between the 1st and 2nd door and the 3rd and 4th door on these cars have been replaced. The remaining upholstered seats were reverted to original seats in May 2006. All C151 trains have had their seats on the middle part of carriage removed.\n\nSome trainsets were reconfigured to have more standing space in the late 1990s as part of an experimental programme. In particular, the second and fifth cars (the blue cars) were reconfigured to have more standing room on both sides of a seat row, as 3 seats from some later cars.\n\nMore grab poles were also added to some cars. Regular grab poles in the centre of each car were replaced by grab poles that branch out into three in the centre, first in 2007, followed by triplicated hand grips and grab poles in 2014. Special non-slip floorings were also tested.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:C651-Standing.jpg|Upholstered cushions, part of an experimental program.

Individual cars are assigned a 4 digit serial number. A complete six-car trainset consists of an identical twin set of one [[driving trailer]](DT) and two motor cars(M1 & M2) permanently coupled together. For example, set 225/226 consists of carriages 3225,1225,2225,2226,1226 and 3226.\n\n* The first digit identifies the car number, where the first car has a 3, the second has a 1 & the third has a 2.\n* The second digit is always a 2, part of the identification numbers\n* The third digit and fourth digit are the train identification numbers. A full-length train of 6 cars has 2 different identification numbers. For example 225/226 (normal coupling) or 216/226 (cross-coupling).\n** [[Siemens]] built sets 201\u2013238.\n\n== Operational incidents ==\n\n* On 15 December 1997, a train door of a C651 rail car was partially dislodged during revenue service as it pulled into [[City Hall MRT station|City Hall]] station. The train was returned to the operator at about 3.30 pm after modification works by the manufacturer [[Siemens|Siemens Transportation Systems Group]] (Germany), and was deployed immediately on revenue service. This was done with the faulty door, its lower part was out of the groove, getting past unnoticed. The incident disrupted services between Newton and Marina Bay stations for about 15 minutes according to the official press release. Siemens Advanced Engineering, the subsidiary of Siemens Transportation Systems Group which oversaw the modification works, was held responsible for the incident.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Siemens C651}}\n*

The train was returned to the operator at about 3.30 pm after modification works by the manufacturer [[Siemens|Siemens Transportation Systems Group]] (Germany), and was deployed immediately on revenue service. This was done with the faulty door, its lower part was out of the groove, getting past unnoticed. The incident disrupted services between Newton and Marina Bay stations for about 15 minutes according to the official press release. Siemens Advanced Engineering, the subsidiary of Siemens Transportation Systems Group which oversaw the modification works, was held responsible for the incident.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Siemens C651}}\n* [http://www.mobility.siemens.com/apps/references/index.cfm?do=app.detail&lID=1&referenceID=469&z=1 Manufacturer's Information for C651, Siemens AG]\n* [https://www.sgtrains.com/train-c651.html Siemens C651 - SGTrains]\n*[https://landtransportguru.net/train-c651/ Siemens C651 - Land Transport Guru]\n*[https://sgwiki.com/wiki/Siemens_C651 Siemens C651 - sgWiki]\n*[http://www.sgbuses.com/index.php?/category/rail-smrt-c651 Siemens C651 - SGBuses.com]\n\n{{Rail transport in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) rolling stock]]\n[[Category:Siemens multiple units]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRefurbishment:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_C651"}

The six naturally occurring noble gases are [[helium]] (He), [[neon]] (Ne), [[argon]] (Ar), [[krypton]] (Kr), [[xenon]] (Xe), and the radioactive [[radon]] (Rn). [[Oganesson]] (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to [[relativistic effects]]; its chemistry has not yet been investigated.\n\nFor the first six periods of the [[periodic table]], the noble gases are exactly the members of '''group&nbsp;18'''. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The [[Inert gas|inertness]] of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and [[Hypercapnia#During diving|carbon dioxide (hypercapnia)]] toxicity.\n\nThe properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of [[atomic structure]]: their [[Electron shell|outer shell]] of [[valence electron]]s is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred [[noble gas compound]]s. The [[melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than {{convert|10|C-change|0}}; that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.\n\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from [[air]] in an [[air separation]] unit using the methods of [[liquefaction of gases]] and [[fractional distillation]]. Helium is sourced from [[natural gas field]]s that have high concentrations of helium in the [[natural gas]], using [[cryogenic]] [[gas separation]] techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the [[radioactive decay]] of dissolved [[radium]], [[thorium]], or [[uranium]] compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A [[Heliox|helium-oxygen breathing gas]] is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}}. After the risks caused by the flammability of [[hydrogen]] became apparent, it was replaced with helium in [[blimp]]s and [[gas balloon|balloons]].\n\n==History==\n''Noble gas'' is translated from the [[German language|German]] noun {{lang|de|Edelgas}}, first used in 1898 by [[Hugo Erdmann]]<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year=1901|volume=13|pages=268\u2013270|last=Renouf|first=Edward|title=Noble gases|doi=10.1126/science.13.320.268|issue=320|bibcode= 1901Sci....13..268R }}</ref> to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity.

Before them, in 1784, the English chemist and physicist [[Henry Cavendish]] had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than [[nitrogen]].<ref name=\"Ozima 1\">{{harvnb|Ozima|2002|p=1}}</ref> A century later, in 1895, [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different [[density]] than nitrogen resulting from [[chemical reaction]]s. Along with Scottish scientist [[William Ramsay]] at [[University College, London]], Lord Rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas, leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element, argon, from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|arg\u00f3s}}, \"idle\" or \"lazy\").<ref name=\"Ozima 1\" /> With this discovery, they realized an entire class of [[gas]]es was missing from the periodic table. During his search for argon, Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating [[cleveite]], a mineral. In 1902, having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and argon, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] included these noble gases as group&nbsp;0 in his arrangement of the elements, which would later become the periodic table.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendeleev|1903|p=497}}</ref>\n\nRamsay continued his search for these gases using the method of [[fractional distillation]] to separate [[liquid air]] into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements [[krypton]], [[neon]], and [[xenon]], and named them after the Greek words {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|krypt\u00f3s}}, \"hidden\"), {{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|n\u00e9os}}, \"new\"), and {{lang|grc|\u03be\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|ks\u00e9nos}}, \"stranger\"), respectively.

In 1895, French chemist [[Henri Moissan]] attempted to form a reaction between [[fluorine]], the most [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed in 1913 that the [[electron]]s in atoms are arranged in [[electron shell|shells]] surrounding the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons.<ref name=\"brit\" /> In 1916, [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] formulated the ''[[octet rule]]'', which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gillespie, R.

The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the [[ionization potential]] decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom.

[[Valence electron]]s are the outermost [[electron]]s of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in [[chemical bond]]ing. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons.<ref>{{harvnb|Ozima|2002|p=35}}</ref> However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by [[electromagnetic force]] than lighter noble gases such as helium, making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.\n\nAs a result of a full shell, the noble gases can be used in conjunction with the [[electron configuration]] notation to form the ''noble gas notation''. To do this, the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first, and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward. For example, the electron notation of\n[[phosphorus]] is 1s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2p<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;3s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;3p<sup>3</sup>, while the noble gas notation is [Ne]&nbsp;3s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;3p<sup>3</sup>.

The six naturally occurring noble gases are [[helium]] (He), [[neon]] (Ne), [[argon]] (Ar), [[krypton]] (Kr), [[xenon]] (Xe), and the radioactive [[radon]] (Rn). [[Oganesson]] (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to [[relativistic effects]]; its chemistry has not yet been investigated.\n\nFor the first six periods of the [[periodic table]], the noble gases are exactly the members of '''group&nbsp;18'''. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The [[Inert gas|inertness]] of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and [[Hypercapnia#During diving|carbon dioxide (hypercapnia)]] toxicity.\n\nThe properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of [[atomic structure]]: their [[Electron shell|outer shell]] of [[valence electron]]s is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred [[noble gas compound]]s. The [[melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than {{convert|10|C-change|0}}; that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.\n\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from [[air]] in an [[air separation]] unit using the methods of [[liquefaction of gases]] and [[fractional distillation]]. Helium is sourced from [[natural gas field]]s that have high concentrations of helium in the [[natural gas]], using [[cryogenic]] [[gas separation]] techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the [[radioactive decay]] of dissolved [[radium]], [[thorium]], or [[uranium]] compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A [[Heliox|helium-oxygen breathing gas]] is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}}. After the risks caused by the flammability of [[hydrogen]] became apparent, it was replaced with helium in [[blimp]]s and [[gas balloon|balloons]].\n\n==History==\n''Noble gas'' is translated from the [[German language|German]] noun {{lang|de|Edelgas}}, first used in 1898 by [[Hugo Erdmann]]<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year=1901|volume=13|pages=268\u2013270|last=Renouf|first=Edward|title=Noble gases|doi=10.1126/science.13.320.268|issue=320|bibcode= 1901Sci....13..268R }}</ref> to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity.

In 1895, French chemist [[Henri Moissan]] attempted to form a reaction between [[fluorine]], the most [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed in 1913 that the [[electron]]s in atoms are arranged in [[electron shell|shells]] surrounding the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons.<ref name=\"brit\" /> In 1916, [[Gilbert N.
