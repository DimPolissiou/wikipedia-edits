It is composed of multiple yachts, in direct competition, racing around a course marked by [[buoy]]s or other fixed navigational devices or racing longer distances across open water from point-to-point. It can involve a series of races when buoy racing or multiple legs when point-to-point racing.\n \n==History==\n[[File:Yacht Racing Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Yacht Racing]]\n[[Yachting]], that is, recreational boating, is very old, as exemplified in the ancient poem [[Catullus 4]]:\n[[File:Bermudian sail racing boats by Lady Brassey 1885.jpg|thumb|right|1883 description of the racing of Bermudian boats, by [[Anna Brassey, Baroness Brassey|Lady Brassey]], with illustrations showing the [[Bermuda rig]]. Initially, working vessels were rented for weekend racing in Bermuda, but affluent competitors of the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] soon purpose-built racers]]\n<blockquote><poem>\nThe yacht you see there, friends, \nsays that she's been\nThe fastest piece of timber ever seen;\nShe swears that once she could have overhauled\nAll rival boats, whether the challenge called\nFor racing under canvas or with oars.\n</poem></blockquote>\n(trans. James Michie)\n\n\"Yacht\" is referred to as deriving from either Norwegian (\"jagt\"), Middle Low German (\"jaght\") or from the Dutch word jacht, which means \"a swift light vessel of war, commerce or pleasure. The sporting element in the word lies in the derivation of jaght from the root jaghen, which means to hunt, chase or pursue\u2026.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/yacht Free Dictionary: definition and derivation of \"yacht\"]</ref>\n\nThe formal racing of boats is believed to have started with sailboats in the [[Netherlands]] some time in the 17th century. Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing \"yachts\" began to emerge and the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] was established in 1815. In 1661 [[John Evelyn]] recorded a competition between ''Katherine'' and ''Anne'', two large royal sailing vessels both of English design, \"\u2026the wager 100-1; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/14}}</ref> One of the vessels was owned, and sometimes steered, by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the King of England. The king lost.\n\nIn 1782 the [[Cumberland Fleet]], a class of sailing vessel known for its ability to sail close to the wind, were painted racing up the [[Thames River]] with spectators viewing from a bridge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/22 22]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/22}}</ref> Much like today, this obsession with sailing close to the wind with speed and efficiency fueled the racing community.\n\nIn the nineteenth century most yacht races were started by allotting starting positions to the competitors. Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the main mast on deck until the starting signal was given.<ref>Athlone Yacht Club, 'notice of race' for Lough Ree Regatta 1835 in Athlone Sentinel, 31 July 1835</ref>      \nThe Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J.

Longer yachts are inherently faster than shorter ones; therefore, in the interests of fairness, in the 1820s a \u201cprimitive system of time allowance was introduced on the [[Solent]].\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/29 29]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/29}}</ref> Larger yachts were handicapped; but owners with the biggest vessels had a problem with the allowance system, for they preferred that crossing the finish line first, much as in foot and horse races, should suffice to win the contest. As a result, both ratings and \u201c[[one-design]]\u201d competition were developed.\n\nRatings systems rely upon some formulaic analysis of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, [[sail area]], [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], and hull shape. During the 1920s and through the 1970s the [[Cruising Club of America]] established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex [[International Offshore Rule]] (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and even speed), the simpler [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet]] (PHRF)<ref>{{cite web|title=US Sailing.|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|access-date=2012-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310012408/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|archive-date=2012-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, as a means to allow dissimilar yachts\u2014typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews\u2014to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.\n\nThe most prevalent handicap rating systems today are the [[Offshore Racing Congress|ORC]], [http://offshore.ussailing.org/ORR.htm ORR], [[IRC (sailing)|IRC]], and the [[PHRF]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Offshore Home|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|access-date=2012-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144937/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|archive-date=2012-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nMany countries organise their own handicap systems which do not take into account the size, weight, or sail area of the yacht, but performance is measured on the basis of previous race results. The Irish E.C.H.O. system is such a handicap system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sailing.ie/Racing/Handicapping |title=ECHO and IRC Handicapping |publisher=Irish Sailing Administrator |author= |date= |website=www.sailing.ie |format= |quote= |access-date=10 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[One-design]] racing was invented by Thomas (Ben) Middleton in 1886 in Killiney Bay close to Dublin City, Republic of Ireland. Middleton was concerned that winning a yacht race was more reliant on having an expensive new yacht, than it was on the skill of the yachtsman.<ref>The water Wags 1887-2012 by Alfred and Vincent Delany</ref> One design yacht racing  is conducted with classes of similar boats, all built\u2014often via mass-production\u2014to the same design, with the same sail area and rig, and the same number of crew, so that crew ability and tactical expertise are more likely to decide a race than boat type, or age, or even weather. Popular racing boats such as The Water Wag, Laser, the [[J/22]] and [[J/24]], the [[Etchells]], and the Star and New York 30 of [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] are examples of one-design boats.\n\nIn general, modern yacht-racing contests are conducted according to the [[Racing Rules of Sailing]],<ref>{{cite web|title=ISAF : About The Racing Rules of Sailing.|url=http://www.sailing.org/documents/rrs-background.php}}</ref> first established in 1928.<ref name=\"The Racing Rules of Sailing\">{{cite web|last=Rushall|first=Mark|title=The Racing Rules of Sailing|url=http://www.rushall.net/images/stories/pdf/the_racing_rules_of_sailing.pdf|publisher=Rushall Partnership|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>  Though complex, the RRS are intended primarily simply ensure fairness and safety.

The sporting element in the word lies in the derivation of jaght from the root jaghen, which means to hunt, chase or pursue\u2026.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/yacht Free Dictionary: definition and derivation of \"yacht\"]</ref>\n\nThe formal racing of boats is believed to have started with sailboats in the [[Netherlands]] some time in the 17th century. Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing \"yachts\" began to emerge and the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] was established in 1815. In 1661 [[John Evelyn]] recorded a competition between ''Katherine'' and ''Anne'', two large royal sailing vessels both of English design, \"\u2026the wager 100-1; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/14}}</ref> One of the vessels was owned, and sometimes steered, by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the King of England.

Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the main mast on deck until the starting signal was given.<ref>Athlone Yacht Club, 'notice of race' for Lough Ree Regatta 1835 in Athlone Sentinel, 31 July 1835</ref>      \nThe Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J.

Longer yachts are inherently faster than shorter ones; therefore, in the interests of fairness, in the 1820s a \u201cprimitive system of time allowance was introduced on the [[Solent]].\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/29 29]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofyachtin0000phil/page/29}}</ref> Larger yachts were handicapped; but owners with the biggest vessels had a problem with the allowance system, for they preferred that crossing the finish line first, much as in foot and horse races, should suffice to win the contest. As a result, both ratings and \u201c[[one-design]]\u201d competition were developed.\n\nRatings systems rely upon some formulaic analysis of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, [[sail area]], [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], and hull shape. During the 1920s and through the 1970s the [[Cruising Club of America]] established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex [[International Offshore Rule]] (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and even speed), the simpler [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet]] (PHRF)<ref>{{cite web|title=US Sailing.|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|access-date=2012-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310012408/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|archive-date=2012-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, as a means to allow dissimilar yachts\u2014typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews\u2014to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.\n\nThe most prevalent handicap rating systems today are the [[Offshore Racing Congress|ORC]], [http://offshore.ussailing.org/ORR.htm ORR], [[IRC (sailing)|IRC]], and the [[PHRF]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Offshore Home|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|access-date=2012-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144937/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|archive-date=2012-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nMany countries organise their own handicap systems which do not take into account the size, weight, or sail area of the yacht, but performance is measured on the basis of previous race results.

Participants can start any time, have any design, any number of crew, and the only two rules are: 1)start and finish at the Ile d\u2019Ouessant, and 2) complete the journey under 80 days.\n* [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race]] - established by [[Robin Knox-Johnston|Sir Robin Knox-Johnston]], the first man to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, the first Clipper race took place in 1996. The race is sailed in a fleet of 12 one-design boats that are designed and built specifically for the race. Each yacht is crewed by a professional skipper and paying novice sailors. It is the longest yacht race, with multiple stopovers and taking 11 months to complete the circumnavigation.\n* [[Barcelona World Race]] \u2013 double-handed (two-crew) non-stop sailing around the world on [[International Monohull Open Classes Association|IMOCA Open 60]] yachts and organized by [[Fundaci\u00f3 Navegaci\u00f3 Oce\u00e0nica Barcelona]].\n\n===Inshore races===\n* [[Admiral's Cup|The Admirals Cup]] \u2013 created in 1957 by the Admiral of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, it is raced every two years. This is a competition between countries who are allowed to send one team and three boats of a chosen one design class. It appears that due to international disagreements that this event no longer takes place.\n* The [[America's Cup]] \u2013 established in 1851, this is the oldest, and arguably the most prestigious, exclusive event in yacht racing. Participants are restricted to a measurement formula for the boats, and the rules concerning the same have been controversial since the very beginning. The English, who were the challengers for the first 132 years of the race, commented \"England rules the waves, but America waives the rules.\" This race was not traditionally an inshore race, due to the requirement that the British boat would sail to the racing area, which involved sailing trans-Atlantically.\n*[[The Heather Cup]] - Contested annually as part of the [[Auckland Anniversary Regatta]], itself founded in 1840, and contested on over 170 yearly occasions since establishment (halted briefly during the Boer/South African War).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n*[[Sailing (sport)]]\n*[[Dinghy racing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category-inline|Yachting}}\n* [http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/10/10/yacht.tragedies/index.html Yachting: No sport for the faint-hearted] - Mike Steere, CNN, 17 October 2008\n* [http://www.thenational.ae/sport/volvo-ocean-race/danger-on-the-high-seas--whales-debris-and-weather-just-some-of-the-obstacles-in-the-volvo-ocean-race Danger on the high seas \u2013 whales, debris and weather just some of the obstacles in the Volvo Ocean Race] -  Steve Elling, The National, 9 October 2014\n\n{{Sailing manoeuvres}}\n{{Sailing worlds}}\n{{America'sCup}}\n{{Offshore sailing races}}\n{{Asian Games Sailing}}\n{{International Sailing Federation Events}}\n\n[[Category:Yachting|*]]\n[[Category:Racing]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRules and ratings:Move images perMOS:IMAGELOCATION.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_racing"}

Its external dimensions are 21.14 \u00d7 31.22 meters, while the Synagogue Square is 22.0 \u00d7 19.35 meters. It was planned to have 410 male and 286 female seats. For women's seating, a gallery was built around the three sides of the interior. In the middle of the interior is the [[Bema]]. The main architectural motif of the interior is the so-called eastern wall (Mizrah) and the cupboard. The latter is a party-building with double Corinthian columns. The semicircular cab has the following inscription: \"Father, King, open the gates of heaven to our prayers.\" (Psalm 113: 3). The lake is surrounded by a large arcade with lined ornamentation, which integrates the lake cabin with the ornate circular window, bridging the columns in a semicircle. The wall's curve has a lion detailing with text reading: \"Praise the Eternal Name from Sunrise to Sunset.\" (Psalm 113: 3).\n\nThe synagogue, together with other religious buildings in its vicinity, is still used by the local Jewish community.\n\n== Sources ==\n* (szerk.)

On game days, various school organizations took turns in toting the ringing bell around Las Cruces before kick-off.

On the following day, April 1, students trudged up the mountain side with their five-gallon cans of whitewash and splashed it on the stones, turning them into a gleaming white \"A\". For many years, giving the \"A\" its annual fresh coat of whitewash was an all-school effort.

This tradition started in the mid 1990s. The first \"Wonder Dog\" was Smoki, a border collie-Australian shepherd mix born in [[Capitan, New Mexico]], and trained by Joel Sims, an NMSU alumni. Smoki \"The Wonder Dog\" entertained the Aggie crowd for six years and retired in 2002.

On game days, various school organizations took turns in toting the ringing bell around Las Cruces before kick-off.

Brave males gathered enough stones to form a big \"A\" easily visible from campus and the surrounding area. On the following day, April 1, students trudged up the mountain side with their five-gallon cans of whitewash and splashed it on the stones, turning them into a gleaming white \"A\". For many years, giving the \"A\" its annual fresh coat of whitewash was an all-school effort. The seniors mixed lime and water at the foot of the mountain and the freshmen and sophomores toted the mixture up to the juniors who splashed it on the \"A.\" With the growth of the university through the years, the tradition was taken over by the Greek Council.<ref name=\"nmstatesports.com\"/>\n\n===The Pride of New Mexico Marching Band===\nThe [[marching band]] of New Mexico State University is known as the Pride of New Mexico.

This tradition started in the mid 1990s. The first \"Wonder Dog\" was Smoki, a border collie-Australian shepherd mix born in [[Capitan, New Mexico]], and trained by Joel Sims, an NMSU alumni. Smoki \"The Wonder Dog\" entertained the Aggie crowd for six years and retired in 2002.

Reportedly, the main risk is funding, in light of the [[F-35 Lightning II]]'s acquisition difficulties and a lack of an \"urgent threat\". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1 Lancers]] were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area-denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low-observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove up the cost of the B-2. The USAF expects it to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a limited production run military aircraft.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/September/Pages/BudgetPressuresSeenasBiggestRisktoLongRangeBomberProgram.aspx \"Budget Pressures Seen as Biggest Risk to Long Range Bomber Program\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410114148/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/September/Pages/BudgetPressuresSeenasBiggestRisktoLongRangeBomberProgram.aspx |date=2016-04-10 }}.

The two companies previously joined together for the program in 2008, but the partnership ended in 2010 when requirements shifted. Boeing believes that as the program had evolved, they can readdress their partnership to specifically address requirements. The team has Boeing's bomber experience and Lockheed Martin's stealth experience. At the time of the announcement, official details about the LRS-B were that it will likely be optionally manned and use stealth technology.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131025/DEFREG02/310250017/Boeing-Lockheed-Team-Long-Range-Strike-Bomber Boeing, Lockheed Team on Long Range Strike Bomber] \u2013 Defensenews.com, 25 October 2013</ref> On 30 January 2014, [[Northrop Grumman]] stated their intention to invest in developing needed technology for the bomber, such as stealth designs, mission management systems, and autonomous controls.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/northrop-to-position-for-future-bomber-work-as-lrs-b-395489/ Northrop to \u2018position\u2019 for future bomber work as LRS-B progresses] \u2013 ''FlightGlobal'', 4 February 2014</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, General Schwartz said that the Pentagon should abandon plans to outfit the F-35 with nuclear weapons in favor of the LRS-B. A 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that replacing the F-16 with the F-35 retains dual conventional and nuclear delivery capabilities for USAF fighters. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] determined that upgrading the F-35 for nuclear deployment would cost $350 million over the next decade. Schwartz said that without financial support from [[NATO]], where some nuclear-capable F-35s would be deployed, those funds should be transferred to the LRS-B. At the same time, Congress cut funding for the [[B61 nuclear bomb]], stripping $10 million from F-35 integration and $34.8 million for life extension; Schwartz stated that B61's life extension must proceed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140117/NEWS04/301170014 |title=Schwartz: Move away from nuclear F-35 |last1=Mehta |first1=Aaron |date=17 January 2014 |work=Military Times |publisher=Gannett Government Media |accessdate=17 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203014928/https://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140117/NEWS04/301170014 |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the USAF reasserted the bomber's need at the annual Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Fla. It was stated it will be fielded in the mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the bombers will be procured. Lt. Gen. Burton Field clarified the 80 to 100 range is due to uncertainty over the price rather than a figure representing the minimum number of bombers needed to mitigate risk.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140220/DEFREG02/302200043/USAF-Defends-Need-New-Long-Range-Bomber?odyssey=mod_sectionstories USAF Defends Need for New Long-Range Bomber] Defense News, 20 February 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://defensetech.org/2013/04/22/next-generation-bomber-survives-budget-tightening/ |title=Next Generation Bomber Survives Budget Tightening |publisher=Defense tech |date=22 April 2013}}</ref> Some USAF leaders expect the unit cost limit of $550 million per aircraft will be exceeded with additional equipment added to the airframe. The cost goal is to set design constraints to prevent extra requirements for capability growth desires and untested technologies that would increase the price more from being incorporated during development. Though the final cost may be greater than planned, a fixed price objective is expected to keep average procurement costs affordable.<ref>[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140305/NEWS04/303050035/General-course-new-Air-Force-bomber-will-more-than-550M-per-plane General: 'Of course' new Air Force bomber will be more than $550M per plane] \u2013 ''Military Times'', 5 March 2014</ref> Rather than the price ceiling being too low to meet requirements, the USAF sees this arrangement as itself and the potential contractor being disciplined about the bomber's missions and roles.

By entering the competitive phase of acquisition, the USAF is limited with what it is able to release, and few details were expected to be made public until the contract is awarded in the second quarter of 2015. The LRS-B is expected to replace the [[B-52]] fleet, possibly replace a portion of the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] fleet, and complement the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] fleet. According to an Air Force study, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses and Rockwell B-1 Lancers currently in inventory will reach the end of their service lives by 2045.<ref>http://www.janes.com/article/70824/us-air-force-could-substantially-increase-b-21-buy</ref>\n\nNorthrop Grumman could base production in Florida if they won the contract, which would provide tax credits, while California passed a bill offering tax credits to the manufacturer if they build it in their state, which would mainly benefit the Boeing\u2013Lockheed Martin team.<ref>[http://www.airforcetimes.com/article/20140710/NEWS04/140710003/Air-Force-sends-next-gen-bomber-requirements-industry-few-details-made-public Air Force sends next-gen bomber requirements to industry, few details made public] - AirForcetimes.com, 10 July 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-launches-competition-for-new-bomber-401315/ USAF launches competition for new bomber] - Flightglobal.com, 11 July 2014</ref> On 14 August 2014, the California legislature passed a measure to apply tax benefits equally to prime and subcontractors.  The previous measure only applied to subcontractors, meaning Lockheed Martin as part of the Boeing\u2013Lockheed Martin team, placing Northrop Grumman at a near half-billion-dollar disadvantage in the bidding; the new measure levels the tax benefit field by also applying them to prime contractors, as Northrop Grumman has no subcontractor and also has operations in Palmdale.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/military-government/northrop-bomber-team-relieved-over-california-legislation Northrop Bomber Team Relieved Over California Legislation] - Aviationweek.com, 15 August 2014</ref>\n\nWith a target price of $550 million per aircraft, [[Defense News]] quoted a source with knowledge of the program predicting that the LRS-B may be smaller than the B-2, perhaps half the size, powered by two engines in the [[Pratt & Whitney F135]] power class.<ref name=\"DefenseNews\">[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/01/18/air-force-bomber-industry/21805275/ Shrouded in Mystery, New Bomber Makes Waves] - Defensenews.com, 19 January 2015</ref>  The target unit cost of $550 million is based on 2010 dollars and is $606 million in 2016 dollars.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shalal |first1=Andrea |title=U.S. picks Northrop Grumman to build next long-range bomber |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/28/us-usa-airforce-bomber-idUSKCN0SL24T20151028|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=27 October 2015}}</ref> One of the program's main effects will be its impact on the industrial base; three of the country's five largest defense firms are competing. After the LRS-B, the USAF will not have another major attack aircraft program until the 2030s for a new fighter, with a follow-on bomber after that.  With that stretch of time in between, the loser may be forced to leave the industry entirely; Northrop Grumman would likely not retain the infrastructure required for the next major undertaking, and Boeing's main aircraft field is now its commercial products.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21650144-three-worlds-biggest-defence-companies-are-locked-contest-could-reshape |title=Battle joined - Three of the world\u2019s biggest defence companies are locked in a contest that could reshape the industry |date= 2 May 2015 |work=The Economist |accessdate=19 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/opinion-usaf-bomber-decision-to-threaten-industrial-417570/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014170457/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/opinion-usaf-bomber-decision-to-threaten-industrial-417570/ |title=OPINION: USAF bomber decision to threaten industrial balance |archivedate=14 October 2015|work=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=14 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Industrial impact may cause any contract to be contested by Congress from representatives that receive campaign donations from a company whose award would create jobs for constituents.  In addition to competing with other USAF priorities, budgets may put the LRS-B at odds with other services' priorities such as the [[Columbia-class submarine]].<ref name=\"DefenseNews\"/>\n\nIn April 2015, Pentagon undersecretary for acquisition [[Frank Kendall]] revealed that individual technologies for the LRS-B will be competed to enhance flexibility, increase competition, and drive down costs.  This means even though one team will build the aircraft, other competitors will have the chance to compete for sustainment and upgrade features.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/air-force/2015/04/09/new-usaf-bomber-will-compete-upgrades-frank-kendall/25536669/ Kendall: New AF Bomber Will Compete Upgrades] - Defensenews.com, 9 April 2015</ref> Although a contract was planned to be awarded in early summer 2015, it was pushed back to September 2015 to ensure the optimal contractor was selected.  Prolonging this part of the process is seen as a time and money-saver later in the acquisition to ensure the resulting bomber can be useful over a 50-year lifespan.<ref>[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/07/22/air-force-plans-bomber-contract-for-september.html Air Force Plans Bomber Contract for September] - Military.com, 22 July 2015</ref>\n\nIn September 2015, the USAF revealed that the LRS-B's development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a contract award.  Final requirements had been finalized since May 2013.  Both competitors had mature proposals with prototyping activities and wind tunnel tests along with subsystems, although no demonstrator had been built.  The designs are \"very different\" from each other with different teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic warfare suites, and communications systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the winner is picked.  The bomber seems similar to the B-2, but more advanced using improved materials for superior low observability, similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone or as part of a strike package with other airborne assets.  Conducting of tests and risk reduction this early in the acquisition process is in part because the program has been handled by the [[Air Staff (United States)#Rapid Capabilities Office|Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office]] since 2011, which has more freedom in how it procures technologies.  To reduce risk, the aircraft's production rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest over the course of the aircraft's production.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/09/02/new-air-force-bomber-testing-stealth-wind-test/71572050/ LRS-B Details Emerge: Major Testing, Risk Reduction Complete] - Defensenews.com, 2 September 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-details-emerge-about-lrs-b-as-contract-announcem-416426/ New details emerge about LRS-B as contract announcement nears] - Flightglobal.com, 4 September 2015</ref> In late September 2015, the contract award was again delayed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2015/09/29/air-force-delays-new-bomber-contract-by-couple-of-months/ |title=Air Force Delays New Bomber Contract by \u2018Couple of Months\u2019 |last1=McGarry |first1=Brendan |date=29 September 2015 |website= dodbuzz.com |publisher=Monster |accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Contract award==\nOn 27 October 2015, the Defense Department awarded the development contract to Northrop Grumman.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pentagon-to-award-long-range-strike-bomber-contract-tuesday/2015/10/27/7f299748-7cc3-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |title=Northrop Grumman wins Long Range Strike Bomber contract |last1=Davenport |first1=Christian |date=27 October 2015 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> The initial value of the contract is $21.4 billion, but the deal could eventually be worth up to $80 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Northrop Grumman Wins $21.4 Billion Pentagon Contract |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/business/northrop-grumman-wins-21-4-billion-pentagon-contract.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2015-10-27 |issn=0362-4331|first=Helene |last=Cooper |access-date=2015-10-28}}</ref><ref name=nprnews>{{cite news |title=Northrop Grumman Chosen To Build Next-Generation Air Force Bomber |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/27/452322151/northrop-grumman-chosen-to-build-next-generation-air-force-bomber |date=27 October 2015 |publisher=NPR |author=Laura Wagner}}</ref><ref name=defensegov>{{cite news |title=Air Force awards LRS-B contract |url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/626131/air-force-awards-lrs-b-contract.aspx|date=27 October 2015 |publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref> The deciding factor in the selection of the Northrop design was cost.<ref>http://www.janes.com/article/64991/northrop-grumman-beat-boeing-for-b-21-on-cost</ref> On 6 November 2015, Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the decision to the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).

Reportedly, the main risk is funding, in light of the [[F-35 Lightning II]]'s acquisition difficulties and a lack of an \"urgent threat\". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1 Lancers]] were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area-denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low-observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove up the cost of the B-2. The USAF expects it to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a limited production run military aircraft.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/September/Pages/BudgetPressuresSeenasBiggestRisktoLongRangeBomberProgram.aspx \"Budget Pressures Seen as Biggest Risk to Long Range Bomber Program\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410114148/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/September/Pages/BudgetPressuresSeenasBiggestRisktoLongRangeBomberProgram.aspx |date=2016-04-10 }}.

Boeing believes that as the program had evolved, they can readdress their partnership to specifically address requirements.

A 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that replacing the F-16 with the F-35 retains dual conventional and nuclear delivery capabilities for USAF fighters. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] determined that upgrading the F-35 for nuclear deployment would cost $350 million over the next decade. Schwartz said that without financial support from [[NATO]], where some nuclear-capable F-35s would be deployed, those funds should be transferred to the LRS-B. At the same time, Congress cut funding for the [[B61 nuclear bomb]], stripping $10 million from F-35 integration and $34.8 million for life extension; Schwartz stated that B61's life extension must proceed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140117/NEWS04/301170014 |title=Schwartz: Move away from nuclear F-35 |last1=Mehta |first1=Aaron |date=17 January 2014 |work=Military Times |publisher=Gannett Government Media |accessdate=17 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203014928/https://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140117/NEWS04/301170014 |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the USAF reasserted the bomber's need at the annual Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Fla. It was stated it will be fielded in the mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the bombers will be procured. Lt. Gen.

In addition to competing with other USAF priorities, budgets may put the LRS-B at odds with other services' priorities such as the [[Columbia-class submarine]].<ref name=\"DefenseNews\"/>\n\nIn April 2015, Pentagon undersecretary for acquisition [[Frank Kendall]] revealed that individual technologies for the LRS-B will be competed to enhance flexibility, increase competition, and drive down costs.  This means even though one team will build the aircraft, other competitors will have the chance to compete for sustainment and upgrade features.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/air-force/2015/04/09/new-usaf-bomber-will-compete-upgrades-frank-kendall/25536669/ Kendall: New AF Bomber Will Compete Upgrades] - Defensenews.com, 9 April 2015</ref> Although a contract was planned to be awarded in early summer 2015, it was pushed back to September 2015 to ensure the optimal contractor was selected.  Prolonging this part of the process is seen as a time and money-saver later in the acquisition to ensure the resulting bomber can be useful over a 50-year lifespan.<ref>[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/07/22/air-force-plans-bomber-contract-for-september.html Air Force Plans Bomber Contract for September] - Military.com, 22 July 2015</ref>\n\nIn September 2015, the USAF revealed that the LRS-B's development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a contract award.  Final requirements had been finalized since May 2013.  Both competitors had mature proposals with prototyping activities and wind tunnel tests along with subsystems, although no demonstrator had been built.  The designs are \"very different\" from each other with different teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic warfare suites, and communications systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the winner is picked.  The bomber seems similar to the B-2, but more advanced using improved materials for superior low observability, similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone or as part of a strike package with other airborne assets.  Conducting of tests and risk reduction this early in the acquisition process is in part because the program has been handled by the [[Air Staff (United States)#Rapid Capabilities Office|Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office]] since 2011, which has more freedom in how it procures technologies.  To reduce risk, the aircraft's production rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest over the course of the aircraft's production.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/09/02/new-air-force-bomber-testing-stealth-wind-test/71572050/ LRS-B Details Emerge: Major Testing, Risk Reduction Complete] - Defensenews.com, 2 September 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-details-emerge-about-lrs-b-as-contract-announcem-416426/ New details emerge about LRS-B as contract announcement nears] - Flightglobal.com, 4 September 2015</ref> In late September 2015, the contract award was again delayed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2015/09/29/air-force-delays-new-bomber-contract-by-couple-of-months/ |title=Air Force Delays New Bomber Contract by \u2018Couple of Months\u2019 |last1=McGarry |first1=Brendan |date=29 September 2015 |website= dodbuzz.com |publisher=Monster |accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Contract award==\nOn 27 October 2015, the Defense Department awarded the development contract to Northrop Grumman.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pentagon-to-award-long-range-strike-bomber-contract-tuesday/2015/10/27/7f299748-7cc3-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |title=Northrop Grumman wins Long Range Strike Bomber contract |last1=Davenport |first1=Christian |date=27 October 2015 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> The initial value of the contract is $21.4 billion, but the deal could eventually be worth up to $80 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Northrop Grumman Wins $21.4 Billion Pentagon Contract |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/business/northrop-grumman-wins-21-4-billion-pentagon-contract.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2015-10-27 |issn=0362-4331|first=Helene |last=Cooper |access-date=2015-10-28}}</ref><ref name=nprnews>{{cite news |title=Northrop Grumman Chosen To Build Next-Generation Air Force Bomber |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/27/452322151/northrop-grumman-chosen-to-build-next-generation-air-force-bomber |date=27 October 2015 |publisher=NPR |author=Laura Wagner}}</ref><ref name=defensegov>{{cite news |title=Air Force awards LRS-B contract |url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/626131/air-force-awards-lrs-b-contract.aspx|date=27 October 2015 |publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref> The deciding factor in the selection of the Northrop design was cost.<ref>http://www.janes.com/article/64991/northrop-grumman-beat-boeing-for-b-21-on-cost</ref> On 6 November 2015, Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the decision to the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).

As of the early 1970s, the Achuar were one of the last of the [[J\u00edvaro|Jivaroan]] groups still generally unaffected by outside contact.\n\nThe name Achuar means \u201cthe people of the [[Moriche Palm|aguaje palm]]\u201d.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n==Lifestyle==\n\n===Households===\nAchuar life centers on the domestic household, which consists of a basic family unit often including close relatives. Although the Achuar ideal is household autonomy and independence in terms of subsistence economy,<ref>Descola 1994: 108</ref> there are usually about ten to fifteen households within the society dispersed throughout the area but still in a relatively close distance of each other. Each of these groupings tends to be [[matrilocal residence|uxorilocal]]. Marriages are typically [[polygyny|polygynous]], with partners somewhat related, or in some instances women are taken from nearby groups during raids. Co-wives are often sisters<ref>Descola 1994: 9</ref> (see [[sororal polygyny]]).\n\nThe standard Achuar home is settled near a river or lake, but at some distance from major waterways because of mosquitoes and to protect the household against raids by canoe.<ref>Descola 1994: 111</ref> It is shaped as a large oval, commonly without outer walls to allow ventilation, with a high roof with straight sides. The roof is often made out of palm tree fronds while two types of palm are used for house beams. Temporary walls are made out of large palms when danger seems close. A large yard and gardens then surround the home on the outside. The size of a house plays a pivotal part in the ego of an Achuar man. The bigger the house is to fit multiple wives and children the more likely that man will be considered a ''juunt'', or \"great man\".\n\nConflicts within the Achuar society are minimal. The constant fight is between neighboring tribes and when tensions greatly increase, the Achuar find refuge in large protected houses that hold six to seven families.\n\n===Tasks===\n[[File:Achuar con cerbatana (Amazon\u00eda Ecuatoriana).jpg|thumb|right|An Achuar man with a [[blowgun]]]]\nWomen and men hold separate daily tasks that are all beneficial for the survival of a family. The women gather and carry the game, sometimes with their children, while also preparing meals. They also have the opportunity to fish with baskets or with lines but overall their role pertains to domestic duties.  Men, on the other hand, work in the forest and hunt. They are also involved in making the tools they use for hunting, like blowguns and traps, and use the technique of clearing for the expansion of their spouses\u2019 gardens.\n\nGardens are maintained solely by women,<ref name=bbc/> at least three days a week. They comprise a large quantity and variety of plant species, but their value delves much deeper than just a source of food. Women can find sanctuary in their gardens and express their grief and suffering in private, as public emotion is spurned. Women also give birth to their children in there, demonstrating the importance of gardens in Achuar lives.\n\nThe Achuar follow an astronomical calendar of seasonal resources, like the fish season, which is divided into days, moons, and year.\n\nAside from the everyday routine, there still remains time for leisure. Thirty-five percent of the day is spent on subsistence production, leaving the rest of the day open. Men and young boys have more time for relaxation compared to women who still have house chores to complete. Before being married, young boys do nothing all day while adolescent girls work in the garden. During the rest of the day, married men drink [[manioc]] beer and talk amongst each other while also doing handiwork, for example woodwork.\n\n==Language==\nThe ethnic group Achuar forms part of the conjunction of the Shuar and form one of the four dialect groups that constitute the linguistic family of the Shuar (Achuar, Shuar, Aguaruna y Huambisa).\n\nThe Achuar speak a [[Shuar language]] and [[Achuar-Shiwiar language]], dialects of the [[Jivaroan languages]]. Achuar Chicham or Achuar are related to other languages such as Shuar Chicham but they differ greatly with the Awajunt language (except for some words and phrases). For this reason, some researchers believe they are not from the Jivaroana family. In the Achuar language, there are only four vowels: a, e, i, u. The 'e' is pronounced differently. The alphabet consists of 21 letters a, aa, ch, e, ee, i, ii, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, ts, u, uu, w, y. In 1982, investigators of Japanese languages were amazed to find records of Achuar conversations \n\n==Religion and cosmology==\n[[Shamanism]] is present in Achuar lifestyle and witchcraft is occasionally practiced by both ritual specialists and laypersons. An example of this is an institutionalized form of reciprocal violence that entitles a person to revert any harmful incidents or material another sent. Jivaroans, of which the Achuar are a sub-group, ascribe to a particular form of the pan-Amazonian [[animism|animistic]] cosmological phenomenon known as '[[Amazonian perspectivism]],'<ref>see also the tab on Brazilian anthropologist [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]] who has written extensively on the subject of Amazonian perspectivism</ref> in which many animals and plants are understood to possess human souls, although their bodily appearance is different. Animals with human souls are significant for the Achuar, as they represent a form of socialized nature. The only way for a hunter to be successful is to live in harmony with the game he hunts and with its guardian spirits, known as ''kuntiniu nukuri'' (literally: \"game mothers\"). The hunter's relationship with both the prey and their \"game mothers\" is personal and cultivated over a lifetime, and these relationships are characterized principally as [[Affinity (law)|affinal]]. He must follow these two rules: taking these animals with moderation and showing respect to the animals he kills. Both of these rules of hunting are codified in cautionary myths.\n\nThe Achuar believe that entities possessing human souls have the ability to communicate through language and signs. This is sometimes experienced during soul journeys, known as ''arutam'' encounters,<ref>For a synopsis of the relationships between body, soul, and Achuar self-identity and the role of ''arutam'' encounters see Taylor 1996.</ref> which represent an extreme state of self-awareness and are induced by the consumption of hallucinogenic drink. [[Ayahuasca]] is a ritual sacrament in Achuar religion.<ref name=bbc/> Dreams are essential for the Achuar as they are not only revealing, but also can be foretelling. Prior to engaging in any form of predatory behavior, whether warfare, hunting, or some forms of fishing, men often insist upon having a dream.\n\nSelf-control is a fundamental aspect of Achuar beliefs, which is taught at a young age. Men exercise discipline to show will power and strength and the best place to display this is in their own home. Examples of self-control would be avoiding gluttony, being able to go without sleep, and not wasting anything. As well, another form of control would be over their expressions and attitudes, especially in front of visitors. Evading eye contact is key or else a sense of aggression might arise and mouths are covered when speaking. Saliva is the only product of the body that is publicly exposed. This is because female saliva is believed to be a source of fermentation of the manioc beer and male saliva is socially incorporated into the speech of a conversation.\n\nGardens are watched over by the spirit of gardens, Nunkui. Women sing ''anents'', magical songs, as a medium to communicate with their plants, Nunkui, and other particular objects. The songs are extremely personal so they are either sung in the head or on an instrument, but always in secret. Each anent has basically the same melodic structure but different lyrics. Yet gardens can also be perilous at times, specifically manioc which is believed to have traits of vampirism. Children are the main targets of the manioc and thus are not allowed to enter a garden without supervision. Blood is precious in the eyes of the Achuar who believe there is a finite amount of blood in each person and when lost it can never be replaced, therefore quickening death.\n\n==Death==\nThe traditional form of burial for the Achuar is placing the deceased person in a hollowed-out log, resembling a canoe. During the funeral of a head of household, the canoe is buried in the middle of the house in remembrance of the continuing presence of the late figure. One spiritual belief of the Achuar regarding death, is the role of the remaining body parts of the dead body. These limbs acquire a life of their own and assume the bodies of certain animals.\n\n==History==\nAchuar were first written about by Western people in 1548; however, they avoided prolonged European contact until the 20th century. Christian missionaries did not gain a foothold in Achuar society until the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n==Non-Indigenous influence on Achuar people==\nDue to the development of the Amazon Rainforest the Achuar people's numbers and livelihood has been declining. When oil was discovered in the Amazon in 1964 oil companies began to make claims on land for development and profit. Such claims, their development, and a history of violent attacks on oil investment installations throughout the Amazon have resulted in the Achuar being excluded from a portion of operational & drilling areas in the territory traditionally claimed by the Achuar. Non-Indigenous contact has also seen introduction of new diseases (including new STDs) and conflict related to pollution from oil spills, improper business practices, and violent interactions.\n\nIn multiple but not all cases, oil spills of various degrees have been inadequately remediated by simple burial. Major oil pipelines run above rivers that the Achuar depend on for bathing and drinking. When these oil pipelines break, pollution can and has occurred, thereby degrading the resource and limiting Achuar access to their historic fresh (but untreated) water sources. Violent conflicts with non-Indigenous people have arisen between oil company employees and the native Achuar. As in much of the Amazon Basin, indigenous sexual practices differ from those in non-Indigenous populations, and modern \"safe sex\" practices are very poorly disseminated thereby putting at risk their population and culture. As a consequence, some advocates claim that non-Indigenous contact contributes to a majority of indigenous deaths.\n\n==Notable Achuar people==\n*[[Jaime Vargas (indigenous leader)|Jaime Vargas]] indigenous leader of the [[2019 Ecuadorian protests]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latercera.com/mundo/noticia/jaime-vargas-lider-indigena-clave-ecuador/855465/|title=Jaime Vargas, el l\u00edder ind\u00edgena clave en Ecuador|date=10 October 2019|work=[[La Tercera]]|language=es-CL|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Amazon Defense Coalition. \"Tribes in Peru-Colombia-Ecuador Border Fear Death by Oil\"\n*Descola, Phillipe. 1994.

As of the early 1970s, the Achuar were one of the last of the [[J\u00edvaro|Jivaroan]] groups still generally unaffected by outside contact.\n\nThe name Achuar means \u201cthe people of the [[Moriche Palm|aguaje palm]]\u201d.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n==Lifestyle==\n\n===Households===\nAchuar life centers on the domestic household, which consists of a basic family unit often including close relatives. Although the Achuar ideal is household autonomy and independence in terms of subsistence economy,<ref>Descola 1994: 108</ref> there are usually about ten to fifteen households within the society dispersed throughout the area but still in a relatively close distance of each other. Each of these groupings tends to be [[matrilocal residence|uxorilocal]]. Marriages are typically [[polygyny|polygynous]], with partners somewhat related, or in some instances women are taken from nearby groups during raids. Co-wives are often sisters<ref>Descola 1994: 9</ref> (see [[sororal polygyny]]).\n\nThe standard Achuar home is settled near a river or lake, but within a distance from major waterways because of mosquitoes and to protect the household against raids by canoe.<ref>Descola 1994: 111</ref> It is shaped as a large oval, commonly without outer walls to allow ventilation, with a high roof with straight sides. The roof is often made out of palm tree fronds while two types of palm are used for house beams. Temporary walls are made out of large palms when danger seems close. A large yard and gardens then surround the home on the outside. The size of a house plays a pivotal part in the ego of an Achuar man. The bigger the house is to fit multiple wives and children the more likely that man will be considered a ''juunt'', or \"great man\".\n\nConflicts within the Achuar society are minimal. The constant fight is between neighboring tribes and when tensions greatly increase, the Achuar find refuge in large protected houses that hold six to seven families.\n\n===Tasks===\n[[File:Achuar con cerbatana (Amazon\u00eda Ecuatoriana).jpg|thumb|right|An Achuar man with a [[blowgun]]]]\nWomen and men hold separate daily tasks that are all beneficial for the survival of a family. The women gather and carry the game, sometimes with their children, while also preparing meals. They also have the opportunity to fish with baskets or with lines but overall their role pertains to domestic duties.  Men, on the other hand, work in the forest and hunt. They are also involved in making the tools they use for hunting, like blowguns and traps, and use the technique of clearing for the expansion of their spouses\u2019 gardens.\n\nGardens are maintained solely by women,<ref name=bbc/> at least three days a week. They comprise a large quantity and variety of plant species, but their value delves much deeper than just a source of food. Women can find sanctuary in their gardens and express their grief and suffering in private, as public emotion is spurned. Women also give birth to their children in there, demonstrating the importance of gardens in Achuar lives.\n\nThe Achuar follow an astronomical calendar of seasonal resources, like the fish season, which is divided into days, moons, and year.\n\nAside from the everyday routine, there still remains time for leisure. Thirty-five percent of the day is spent on subsistence production, leaving the rest of the day open. Men and young boys have more time for relaxation compared to women who still have house chores to complete. Before being married, young boys do nothing all day while adolescent girls work in the garden. During the rest of the day, married men drink [[manioc]] beer and talk amongst each other while also doing handiwork, for example woodwork.\n\n==Language==\nThe ethnic group Achuar forms part of the conjunction of the Shuar and form one of the four dialect groups that constitute the linguistic family of the Shuar (Achuar, Shuar, Aguaruna y Huambisa).\n\nThe Achuar speak a [[Shuar language]] and [[Achuar-Shiwiar language]], dialects of the [[Jivaroan languages]]. Achuar Chicham or Achuar are related to other languages such as Shuar Chicham but they differ greatly with the Awajunt language (except for some words and phrases). For this reason, some researchers believe they are not from the Jivaroana family. In the Achuar language, there are only four vowels: a, e, i, u. The 'e' is pronounced differently. The alphabet consists of 21 letters a, aa, ch, e, ee, i, ii, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, ts, u, uu, w, y. In 1982, investigators of Japanese languages were amazed to find records of Achuar conversations \n\n==Religion and cosmology==\n[[Shamanism]] is present in Achuar lifestyle and witchcraft is occasionally practiced by both ritual specialists and laypersons. An example of this is an institutionalized form of reciprocal violence that entitles a person to revert any harmful incidents or material another sent. Jivaroans, of which the Achuar are a sub-group, ascribe to a particular form of the pan-Amazonian [[animism|animistic]] cosmological phenomenon known as '[[Amazonian perspectivism]],'<ref>see also the tab on Brazilian anthropologist [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]] who has written extensively on the subject of Amazonian perspectivism</ref> in which many animals and plants are understood to possess human souls, although their bodily appearance is different. Animals with human souls are significant for the Achuar, as they represent a form of socialized nature. The only way for a hunter to be successful is to live in harmony with the game he hunts and with its guardian spirits, known as ''kuntiniu nukuri'' (literally: \"game mothers\"). The hunter's relationship with both the prey and their \"game mothers\" is personal and cultivated over a lifetime, and these relationships are characterized principally as [[Affinity (law)|affinal]]. He must follow these two rules: taking these animals with moderation and showing respect to the animals he kills. Both of these rules of hunting are codified in cautionary myths.\n\nThe Achuar believe that entities possessing human souls have the ability to communicate through language and signs. This is sometimes experienced during soul journeys, known as ''arutam'' encounters,<ref>For a synopsis of the relationships between body, soul, and Achuar self-identity and the role of ''arutam'' encounters see Taylor 1996.</ref> which represent an extreme state of self-awareness and are induced by the consumption of hallucinogenic drink.
