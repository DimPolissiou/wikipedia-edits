It is located near [[University of Delhi]] and has an area under 2 square kilometers. Its population is about 10,000. Timarpur is the first government colony<ref>http://www.delhigovt.nic.in</ref>{{Not in refs|date=July 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019}} situated by the Government of India and is predominantly a government residential area.\n\nThe area includes eight schools, including six [[Senior_secondary_education|senior secondary]] schools, one [[Primary_school|primary school]], and one special school for intellectually disabled children. \n\nThe health services in Timarpur include the INMAS health center, which is the biggest [[thyroid]] center in [[India]]. A government-owned [[Ayushman_Bharat_Yojana|CGHS]] dispensary is also present in the area. \n\nTimarpur is well connected to the Delhi Tilak Basumatary service.\n\nThe area also includes a [[DRDO]] complex consisting of both residential and official areas. \n\nIn Timarpur there is a local dairy village of Gurjar of Mandaar clan since 1911. In the village there around 46 families and 180-220 houses in the village.  \n\n==Legislature==\nThe [[Legislative_assembly|legislative assembly]] of Timarpur is currently (2014-2019) run by the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]]. The legislator of the area is [[Manoj Tiwari]].\n\n==Residence==\n[[File:Timarpur Residential Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|A building in the residential complex of Timarpur]]\nMost of the area is occupied by government flats, although a private colony is also present there. The area includes about 2,000 government flats which are meant for active government servants. A small portion of the area known as Banarsi Das Estate is privately owned. There are two police stations present in the area. Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and Timarpur dairy village of Gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand [[Ramlila]] is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the [[British_Raj|British Raj]] in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]].

It is located near [[University of Delhi]] and has an area under 2 square kilometers. Its population is about 10,000. Timarpur is the first government colony<ref>http://www.delhigovt.nic.in</ref>{{Not in refs|date=July 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019}} situated by the Government of India and is predominantly a government residential area.\n\nThe area includes eight schools, including six [[Senior_secondary_education|senior secondary]] schools, one primary school, and one special school for intellectually disabled children. \n\nThe health services in Timarpur include the INMAS health center, which is the biggest [[thyroid]] center in [[India]]. A government-owned [[Ayushman_Bharat_Yojana|CGHS]] dispensary is also present in the area. \n\nTimarpur is well connected to the Delhi Tilak Basumatary service.\n\nThe area also includes a [[DRDO]] complex consisting of both residential and official areas. \n\nIn Timarpur there is a local dairy village of Gurjar of Mandaar clan since 1911. In the village there around 46 families and 180-220 houses in the village.  \n\n==Legislature==\nThe [[Legislative_assembly|legislative assembly]] of Timarpur is currently (2014-2019) run by the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]]. The legislator of the area is [[Manoj Tiwari]].\n\n==Residence==\n[[File:Timarpur Residential Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|A building in the residential complex of Timarpur]]\nMost of the area is occupied by government flats, although a private colony is also present there. The area includes about 2,000 government flats which are meant for active government servants. A small portion of the area known as Banarsi Das Estate is privately owned. There are two police stations present in the area. Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and Timarpur dairy village of Gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand [[Ramlila]] is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the [[British_Raj|British Raj]] in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]]. The area holds a forest where people come to jog and exercise. It was at one time used by the British armed forces during the British Raj.

Four ships were ordered under the 1896 fiscal year budget (''Murakumo'' and ''Shinonome'' on 15 January 1897, and  ''Y\u016bgiri'' and ''Shiranui'' on 7 May 1797), and an additional two under the 1897 budget (''Kager\u014d'' and ''Usugumo'' on 6 May 1898). All were ordered from [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]] in [[Chiswick]], [[England]].<ref>Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''</ref> The last two were slightly (7\u00bd tons) heavier than the first four, and thus had 1\u00bd inches greater draught.<ref>Lyon, ''The Thornycroft List''</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe design of the ''Murakumo''-class destroyers was based on Thorneycroft's [[Flue gas stack|two-stack]] destroyers for the Royal Navy (from 1913 known as the {{sclass2-|D|destroyer (1913)|4}}) also known as the \"Thirty Knotters\". Although slightly smaller than the ''Ikazuchi'' class, they had the same armaments.\n\nAll ''Murakumo''-class vessels had a [[flush deck]] design with a distinctive \"turtleback\" [[forecastle]] that was intended to clear water from the bow during high speed navigation, but was poorly designed for high waves or bad weather. The bridge and forward gun platform were barely raised above the bow, resulting in a wet conning position. More than half of the small hull was occupied by the boilers and the engine room. With fuel and weaponry, there was little space left for crew quarters.\n\nAll were powered by [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engines]] for {{convert|5,800|shp|kW|lk=in}} and had [[coal|coal-fired]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. Armament was one [[British ordnance terms#QF|QF]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] gun on a bandstand on the [[forecastle]], five [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] guns (two sited abreast the [[conning tower]], two sited between the funnels and one on the [[Deck (ship)|quarterdeck]]) and 2 single tubes for {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo]]es.<ref>Cocker, ''Destroyers of the Royal Navy''</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nAll six ''Murakumo''-class destroyers arrived in Japan in time to be used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905. All were present at the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the final crucial [[Battle of Tsushima]].\n\nThe ''Murakumo''-class vessels reclassified as third-class destroyers on 28 August 1912, and were removed from front-line combat service. ''Usugumo'' was wrecked in a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] in July 1913, but was salved and restored to service; ''Shinonome'' was lost when she broke in two during a typhoon off [[Taiwan]] on 23 July 1913 and not recovered.<ref>Nishida, ''Imperial Japanese Navy''</ref>\n\nThe five surviving vessels were again used in combat with the start of [[World War I]], during the [[Siege of Tsingtao|Battle of Tsingtao]]<ref>Halpern. A ''Naval History of World War I''</ref> and in the operations to seize [[List of former German colonies|German colonial possessions]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].\n\nAfter the war, ''Murakumo'' and ''Y\u016bgiri'' were demilitarized, and used as depot ships in 1919\u201320, and then as auxiliary [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] in 1920. ''Shiranui'' and ''Kager\u014d'' served as tenders to the torpedo school in 1918, and were for disposal at Kure in April 1922 (broken up in 1923). ''Usugumo'' was similarly struck from the [[Navy List]] in 1922, and was broken up in 1927.\n\n== List of ships ==\n\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! Kanji\n!

The bridge and forward gun platform were barely raised above the bow, resulting in a wet conning position. More than half of the small hull was occupied by the boilers and the engine room. With fuel and weaponry, there was little space left for crew quarters.\n\nAll were powered by [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engines]] for {{convert|5,800|shp|kW|lk=in}} and had [[coal|coal-fired]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. Armament was one [[British ordnance terms#QF|QF]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] gun on a bandstand on the [[forecastle]], five [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] guns (two sited abreast the [[conning tower]], two sited between the funnels and one on the [[Deck (ship)|quarterdeck]]) and 2 single tubes for {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo]]es.<ref>Cocker, ''Destroyers of the Royal Navy''</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nAll six ''Murakumo''-class destroyers arrived in Japan in time to be used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905. All were present at the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the final crucial [[Battle of Tsushima]].\n\nThe ''Murakumo''-class vessels reclassified as third-class destroyers on 28 August 1912, and were removed from front-line combat service. ''Usugumo'' was wrecked in a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] in July 1913, but was salved and restored to service; ''Shinonome'' was lost when she broke in two during a typhoon off [[Taiwan]] on 23 July 1913 and not recovered.<ref>Nishida, ''Imperial Japanese Navy''</ref>\n\nThe five surviving vessels were again used in combat with the start of [[World War I]], during the [[Siege of Tsingtao|Battle of Tsingtao]]<ref>Halpern. A ''Naval History of World War I''</ref> and in the operations to seize [[List of former German colonies|German colonial possessions]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].\n\nAfter the war, ''Murakumo'' and ''Y\u016bgiri'' were demilitarized, and used as depot ships in 1919\u201320, and then as auxiliary [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] in 1920. ''Shiranui'' and ''Kager\u014d'' served as tenders to the torpedo school in 1918, and were for disposal at Kure in April 1922 (broken up in 1923). ''Usugumo'' was similarly struck from the [[Navy List]] in 1922, and was broken up in 1927.\n\n== List of ships ==\n\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! Kanji\n!

It was written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Saul Metzstein]]. The episode was watched by 7.45 million viewers in the UK and received positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn the episode, an entity called the [[Great Intelligence]] ([[Richard E. Grant]]) kidnaps Victorian-era detectives [[Madame Vastra]] ([[Neve McIntosh]]) and [[Jenny Flint]] ([[Catrin Stewart]]) and their butler [[Strax]] ([[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]]) to force their friend, [[Time travel in fiction|time-travelling]] alien [[Eleventh Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]), to come to planet Trenzalore, the site of the Doctor's future grave.

They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]], the incarnation who fought during the great [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Eighth Doctor]], the [[Ninth Doctor]] and the [[Tenth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hurt]] makes his first ever appearance as the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]] at the climax of the episode, foreshadowing the events of [[The Night of the Doctor|\"The Night of the Doctor\"]] and [[The Day of the Doctor|\"The Day of the Doctor\"]], the 50th Anniversary special, in which the events of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and also the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth Doctor's]] regeneration as well as the War Doctor's own is finally explained, bridging the gap between [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 Television Movie]] and the 2005 episode [[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.

They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]], the incarnation who fought during the great [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Eighth Doctor]], the [[Ninth Doctor]] and the [[Tenth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hurt]] makes his first ever appearance as the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]] at the climax of the episode, foreshadowing the events of [[The Night of the Doctor|\"The Night of the Doctor\"]] and [[The Day of the Doctor|\"The Day of the Doctor\"]], the 50th Anniversary special, in which the events of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and also the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth Doctor's]] regeneration as well as the War Doctor's own is finally explained, bridging the gap between [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 Television Movie]] and the 2005 episode [[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.
