Designed specifically around the [[Seaslug missile|Seaslug]] [[anti-aircraft]] missile system, the primary role of these ships was area air defence around the [[aircraft carrier]] task force in the nuclear-war environment.<ref name= RINApaper1974 >Purvis,M.K., 'Post War RN Frigate and Guided Missile Destroyer Design 1944\u20131969',  Transactions,  Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), 1974</ref><ref name=MarriottBook >Marriott, Leo: ''Royal Navy Destroyers since 1945'', {{ISBN|0-7110-1817-0}}, Ian Allan Ltd, 1989</ref>\n\nEight ships were built and entered service. Two served in the [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|British naval task force]] in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. After leaving British service, four ships were sold to the Chilean Navy and one to the Pakistan Navy.\n\n==Design and development== \nA class of ten ships was envisaged in 1958 for about [[British pound|\u00a3]]6\u20137.5 million each,<ref>G. Moore. Daring to Devonshire in Warship 2006. Conway Maritime. (London) p124, 130</ref> equivalent to a costed programme for four large, Seaslug-armed, 15,000-ton cruisers, estimated at \u00a314 million each,{{sfn|Moore|2005| p124}} based on an upgraded [[Minotaur-class cruiser (1947)|''Minotaur''-class cruiser]] (1951), approved for full design in early 1955. The final four County-class ships, with hull numbers 07 to 10, were delayed in 1960 while an anti-submarine escort carrier was considered. Hulls 07 and 08 were approved in 1963 as a temporary stopgap,<ref>Moore. (2005) p 130 & ADM 167 162 1963</ref> and the ninth and tenth hulls were cancelled.\n\nThe class was designed as a hybrid cruiser-destroyer, with a much larger displacement  -similar to that of the [[Dido-class cruiser|''Dido''-class cruiser]] - than its predecessor, the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1949)|4}}. In 1955 the new [[First Sea Lord]] [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] specified the development of an April 1955, 4800 ton Fast fleet escort design (DNC 7/959) as a Seaslug carrying vessel with a Y stern positioned  twin 3/70 AA mount replaced by Seaslug (DNC 7/1002) {{sfn|Moore|2005|p=123}} instead of the then approved development of a large GW 58A 15,400 ton cruiser  <ref>Moore. Warship (2005), p 123</ref> which would have combined Seaslug with Type 984 3D radar and a conventional [[Tiger-class cruiser|''Tiger''-class]] gun armament.  During  1956\u20131958 a full \"alternative\" gun armament was an option for the new GW Fast Escort, {{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|pages=48\u201351}} based on a modern [[Combined steam and gas|combined gas turbine and steam turbine]] (COSAG) propulsion unit, as enlarged ''Daring'' fleet escorts, armed with two twin Mk 6 4.5-inch guns, two twin L/70 40mm Bofors and a twin 3-inch/70 guns. A detailed March 1957 study <ref>DNC 7/1014 for Board of Admiralty</ref> opted for a medium tensile {{convert|505|ft|abbr=on}} long hull and a fit of 18 Seaslug and 4 special (nuclear) Seaslug for extended range AA, anti-missile and anti-ship.<ref>DNC 7/1014</ref> twin Mk 5 Bofors 40mm were maintained with the future and effectiveness of the \"Green Light\" (which would become Seacat) missile, under doubt{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=127}} and [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] mortar was the only anti-submarine weapon.\n\nA revised design in March 1958 added Seaslug and [[Seacat missile]]s and added a telescopic hangar. Mountbatten staged an impressive demonstration shoot for [[flag officer]]s and politicians: the Seaslug test ship [[HMS Girdle Ness|HMS ''Girdle Ness'']] launched ten successive Seaslugs, including a salvo of two Seaslugs together. The success included hits in the lethal zone of two piston-engine [[Fairey Firefly]] radio-controlled drones, at {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} undemanding  targets with a speed of only 315/375&nbsp;mph.{{sfn |Grove |2005 |page=198}} This apparent success enabled the Minister of Defence [[Duncan Sandys]] to gain the approval of the Cabinet Defence Committee for Seaslug production to be approved in 1958.<ref>E.

ADM 205/172 1958, (26) p. 211</ref>\n\nWhile the missile worked against Second World War-era level flying targets, the beam guidance system was dubious at range and in rough water which meant eight fixed stabilisers were added to the design of the County-class. Advocacy for the guided missiles fit{{sfnp|Wise|2007|pages=19\u201321}} was led by Mountbatten{{sfnp|Jane's|1980}} and the Cabinet agreed with using the system, despite staff reports over missile unreliability and inaccuracy,{{sfnp|Wise|2007|pages=19\u201321}} confirmed by the dismal performance in the following 1959 Seaslug target launches at [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex|Woomera]] in South Australia.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=198}}. Many Royal Australian Navy officers felt Seaslug was unsuitable for the RAN.{{sfnp|Moore|2005|pages=132\u2013133, note&nbsp;26, p.&nbsp;135}}\n\nFinal, late 1958 revisions to the design<ref>ADM 167 152 1958 and First Lords Record (Public Record Office)- the final, construction order, ship cover and legend no longer exist</ref> were to adopt a high flush deck from B turret, increasing internal space, the cancellation of the nuclear-tipped Seaslug, and provision for folding fins for the Seaslug, all allowing storage of 20 extra missile bodies in tubular form for rapid assembly. Against staff advice, a tight fitting, fixed side-hangar for the anti-submarine [[Westland Wessex]] helicopter was added on the insistence of the First Sea Lord.{{sfnp|Mountbatten|1989|page=187}} While a flawed layout, it proved usable when tested in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nLord Mountbatten classified the cruiser-sized County-class as destroyers rather than cruisers, although they had  destroyer-level fittings. Politically the ''Tiger''s and other cruisers were considered outdated empire relics, and with the apparently impressive performance of Seaslug against jet [[Gloster Meteor]] UC15 drones, Mountbatten could give the Royal Navy a large number of County-class 'destroyers' and a greater number of ship commands and posts for ambitious officers.{{sfnp|Wilson|2013|pages=624\u2013625}}\n\nWhile short on the support and logistic spares stocks of a traditional cruiser, they were still envisaged by the [[Director of Naval Construction]] as being 'probably' used in the cruiser role{{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|page=48}} with space for Flag staff offices, and admiral's barge accommodation{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|pages=181\u2013190}} in the 1960s: the last decade when the UK oversaw significant colonial territory (\"[[East of Suez]]\"). Its missile capability had been overtaken by aircraft development by 1962\u201363, when HMS ''Devonshire'' and ''Hampshire'' entered service, but in the early and mid-1960s the modern lines of these guided-missile destroyers, with their traditional RN cruiser style and their impressive-looking missiles, enabled the overstretched Royal Navy to project sufficient power to close down the threat of a militant, left-leaning Indonesia to Malaysia and Borneo during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]].<ref>N. van der Bijl.

Seaslug was a first-generation [[surface-to-air missile]] intended to hit high-flying nuclear-armed bombers and shadowing surveillance aircraft like the [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\"]], which could direct strikes against the British fleet from missile destroyers and cruise missile-armed submarines. {{cnspan|Bears were formidable targets for a missile like Seaslug|date=September 2018}}; the long-range Soviet turboprop aircraft flew at an altitude of {{convert|7.5|mi|ft m|abbr=on}}, at {{convert|572|mph|abbr=on}}<ref>Gunston, B.

Motorbooks International, (rep Osprey, Reed, ed), WI, USA (2005) p. 425.</ref> and were barely within the engagement capability of Seaslug.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe Seaslug system was a large weapon. Each missile was {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and weighed two tons; its handling arrangements and electronics systems were also large; so even fitting a single system aboard a ship the size of the Counties was a challenge. The missiles were stowed horizontally in a long unarmoured magazine which was sited above the waterline and took up a great deal of internal space. The risk of fire near the magazine was checked by an automatic sprinkler system.{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=129}} In order to increase the number of missiles that could be carried, on the last four ships, some of the missiles were stored partly disassembled in the forward end of the magazine. Their wings and fins would be reattached before being moved into the aft sections of the handling spaces and eventually loaded onto the large twin launcher for firing. \n\nThe limitations of the beam riding guidance method and lack of a homing head, meant the Mk 1 and 2 Seaslug were intended to have nuclear variants - the much larger blast compensating for lack of accuracy. However nuclear warhead for Mk 1 Seaslug (for the first group of ships) was dropped as it needed extra crew, space and security which were not available on the smaller hull; development of the nuclear warhead for Seaslug on the second group of ships was cancelled in June 1962,<ref>{{cite |first=R. |last=Moore |title=Nuclear.

First Lord Mountbatten doubted the usefulness of tactical nuclear weapons by 1962, due to escalation theories,scientific advice and greater evidence of fallout consequences, leading to the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. There were also staff and space difficulties with carrying nuclear warheads on confined destroyers.{{sfnp|Mountbatten|1989 }} As early as 1952, Air Chief Marshal [[John Slessor]] ([[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]) the most influential defence Advisor to Winston Churchill considered the Navy irrelevant in a nuclear war,{{sfn|Seldon |1981|p=334-5}} he first defined, the role of RN was \"uncertain\"{{sfn|Seldon |1981|p=334-5}}  as a pretext to maintain a large fleet and required only for political reasons.

However by 1962, the US was concentrating on the medium range radar guided [[RIM-24 Tartar|RIM-24 Tartar]] and long range [[RIM-8 Talos]], which had success against long range North Vietnamese aircraft from 1968.<ref>S.Tindle. USS Long Beach.The Last Cruiser, in Ships Monthly,Aug 2018,p40.</ref> The Royal Air Force's semi-active land-based [[Bristol Bloodhound]] was unrelated to Seaslug development, but drew top scientists away from RN work. \n\nThe County-class  design attempted to give maximum protection from nuclear fallout, with the operation rooms, where the ship was fought, located 5 decks below, deep in the ship, with a lift  from the bridge,{{sfnp|Marland|2016|page=77}} which maintained some duplicated command systems. The operations room, sited the main radar, sonar, electronic warfare screens and communication data and computer links.  The electronics required for the Seaslug were the large [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]] and the [[Type 965 radar|Type 965 air-search radar]]. These required a great deal of weight to be carried high up on the ship, further affecting ship layout. According to a RN Naval architect, \"Sea Slug did not live up to expectations\" and was obsolete by 1957.{{sfnp|Brown|Moore|2003|pages=39, 188}} The compromises required by the heavy and dated Seaslug system detracted from the success and popularity of an otherwise advanced ship design. Its ineffectiveness and vulnerable magazine{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=133}} and missile fuel, reduced confidence in the class, which had potential as command ships, having good seaworthiness, speed and in the group two County class a spacious  operations room with [[ADAWS]].\n\nIn 1960, because US-designed missiles were seen at the time to be superior to the Seaslug, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) proposed a County-class armed with the US Tartar missile and two additional modifications: hangar space for three [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters and a steam propulsion system, rather than the [[combined steam and gas]] system used in the County class. However, the RAN instead decided to proceed with the {{sclass-|Perth|destroyer|4}} (a modified version of the US {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|4}}). Two different reasons have been put forward for the Australian decision: according to an Australian history, British authorities would not allow a steam-propelled variant of the County,<ref>Cooper, Alastair; cited by Stevens, David, ed. (2001). ''The Royal Australian Navy. The Australian Centenary History of Defence'' (vol. III); South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, pp. 190\u20131</ref> whereas, according to a British account, the re-design required to accommodate the Tartar missile would have taken longer than the RAN deemed to be acceptable.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|pages=195}}\n\nThe US Terrier missile had some support amongst the RN staff, but consideration was not given to acquiring it for the second batch of four ships,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} as the County class were \"shop windows\" for advanced UK technology, and it was vital for the British missile and aerospace industry to continue the Sea Slug project, to allow the development of the much improved [[Sea Dart]] missile.  Following problems with the original version, a reworked Action Data Automation Weapon System (ADAWS) was successfully trialled on HMS ''Norfolk'' in 1970.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=191}} In the mid-1960s the County-class destroyers were assets; their impressive appearance and [[data link]]s, feeding off the carriers' [[Type 984 radar]], projected effective capability during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]].{{sfnp|Wilson|2013|pages=627 & spec}}{{sfn|Hall (December 2008)|page=50}} The Mark 1 Seaslug was operationally reliable and proved useful as a missile target for the new Sea Dart missiles in the late 1970s and early 1980s; the supersonic Mark 2 version proved less effective for this. There are questions as to whether it was ever fully operational and there were problems with missiles breaking up when the boosters separated.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=192}} Inaccuracy, primitive [[beam-riding guidance]] and lack of [[infrared homing]] or a [[proximity fuze]] in the Mk 1 made it of limited value.{{sfnp|Brown|Moore|2003|page=39}} Short-range air defence was provided by the [[Seacat (missile)#GWS-22|GWS-22 Seacat]] anti-aircraft missile system, which made the Counties the first Royal Navy warships to be armed with two different types of guided missile.\n\n===Batch 2 improvements===\n[[File:NAVO eskader bezoekt Amsterdam, vlaggeschip HNS Norfolk, Bestanddeelnr 928-6223.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Norfolk'', a Batch 2 ship, following modification that  removed the 'B' turret and replaced it with four Exocet laucher boxes]]\nAs constructed, the County-class ships were armed with a pair of twin [[QF 4.5 inch naval gun|QF 4.5-inch gun]] mountings. These had magazines for 225 shells for each gun, two-thirds of the magazine capacity for the same guns in the single-turreted [[Leander-class frigate|''Leander''-class frigate]]s.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=189}} The second batch of four ships (''Antrim'', ''Fife'', ''Glamorgan'' and ''Norfolk'') were refitted in the mid-1970s \u2013 their 'B'-position turrets were removed and replaced by four single [[Exocet|MM38 Exocet]] surface-to-surface anti-ship-missile launcher boxes in order to increase the fleets anti-ship capability following retirement of its aircraft carriers.{{sfnp|Marriott|1989|p=106}} This made the County-class ships the only Royal Navy ships to be fitted with three separate types of guided missile: Seaslug, Seacat and Exocet. It also left the un-refitted ships as the last Royal Navy vessels able to fire a broadside from multiple main armament gun turrets. HMS ''London'' fired the last Royal Navy broadside on  10 December 1981 in the [[English Channel]], after returning from its final deployment in the [[West Indies]].{{sfn|Hall (December 2008)|pages=51}} It had also fired off the last Seaslug Mk 1 stocks that year, as targets for Type 42 Sea Dart workups, prior to her hand-over to the [[Pakistani Navy]]. Sold by the British Government on 23 March 1982, she sailed without notice from Portsmouth in late May 1982 for Pakistan during the Falklands crisis, and consideration may have been given to reclaiming it for war service.\n\n===Possible development===\nIt was suggested by Vosper Thornycroft that the Counties could have been developed for the anti-submarine role by replacing the Seaslug system with a larger hangar and flight deck and the possibility of removing Seaslug and rebuilding the missile tunnel as storage for extra [[Westland Lynx]] helicopters.{{sfnp|Jane's|1980}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} Certainly, these arrangements as originally installed to operate a single [[Westland Wessex]] anti-submarine helicopter were problematic, with a hangar so cramped it took an hour to get the aircraft either in or out again, during which the port Seacat launcher was unusable. However it was determined that beam-restrictions would still limit the Counties' helicopter operation in RN service to the obsolescent Wessex, as they were too narrow to handle the far more capable [[Westland Sea King|British-built Sea King HAS]]. The Chilean navy, however, did convert two of the four ships they purchased along these lines.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Ships of the class==\nEight vessels were built in two batches between 1959 and 1970, the later four vessels carrying the improved Seaslug GWS2 and updated electronics requiring rearranged mastheads. The major identifying feature was the Batch 2 vessels' prominent \"double-bedstead\" AKE-2 antennas of the [[Type 965 radar|Type 965 air-search radar]], and their taller foremast carrying the Type 992Q low-angle search radar.\n\n===Ships' names===\n\nFour of the \"Counties\" had names which had been used by the famous interwar {{sclass2-|County|cruiser}}s: ''London'', ''Norfolk'', ''Devonshire'' and ''Kent''. (The last of that clas, {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}}, had survived until 1959 as a trials ship). ''Devonshire'', ''Hampshire'' and ''Antrim'' had been the names of  {{sclass-|Devonshire|cruiser (1903)|0}} [[armoured cruiser]]s of the [[First World War]].\n\nFour of the new ships were named after counties containing a [[Royal Navy Dockyard]]: [[Devonshire]] ([[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]]), [[Hampshire]] ([[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]]), ''Kent'' ([[Chatham Dockyard]]), and [[Fife]] ([[Rosyth dockyard]]). [[Glamorgan]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]]  are the counties in Wales and Northern Ireland which contain the port cities and regional capitals of [[Cardiff]] and [[Belfast]] (by analogy to ''London'', England). [[Norfolk]] is the county of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s birth, and the important 19th-century ports of [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[King's Lynn]].\n\nThree of the ships' names have been subsequently re-used: {{HMS|London|F95|6}} was a [[Type 22 frigate]].

It destroyed her aircraft hangar and the port Seacat mounting. Her captain's prompt reaction to visual detection of the Exocet narrowly averted a hit on the fatally vulnerable Seaslug magazine, by turning the ship so as to give as small a target as possible (the stern) to the incoming weapon. The ship suffered fourteen deaths, injuries, and was lucky to survive with extensive damage and flooding. Had the missile hit a few inches higher, the above waterline magazine would have blown in an explosive fireball and many more of the crew{{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|page=51}} might have been lost.\n\n===Disposal===\nAll eight of the class had short Royal Navy careers, serving on average less than 16 years. Only ''London'' of the first batch would serve further (transferred to Pakistan) while the other three Batch 1 ships were decommissioned by 1980 with ''Hampshire'' being immediately scrapped in 1977 after cannibalization for spares, and ''Devonshire'' sunk in weapons testing in 1984. ''Kent'' would serve as a floating (though immobile) accommodation and training ship in [[Portsmouth]] harbour until 1996.  The four ships of Batch 2 however would be operated for 16 to 23 more years after sale to the [[Chilean Navy]], in which they all received extensive upgrades and modernisation.\n\n==Construction programme==\nThe ships were built at the major UK yards, with some of the machinery coming from [[Associated Electrical Industries]] of Manchester, [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company]] of Wallsend-on-Tyne, [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]] of Southampton, [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrows]] of Glasgow, and the [[Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company]], Wallsend-on-Tyne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+County-class ships<ref name=NE1963>''Navy Estimates, 1963\u201364'', page 70, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1963''</ref>{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=133}}<ref name=DE1964 >''Defence Estimates, 1964\u201365'', page 72, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1964''</ref><ref name=DE1967>''Defence Estimates, 1967\u201368'', page 75, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1967''</ref>\n|-valign=top\n!

Designed specifically around the [[Seaslug missile|Seaslug]] [[anti-aircraft]] missile system, the primary role of these ships was area air defence around the [[aircraft carrier]] task force in the nuclear-war environment.<ref name= RINApaper1974 >Purvis,M.K., 'Post War RN Frigate and Guided Missile Destroyer Design 1944\u20131969',  Transactions,  Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), 1974</ref><ref name=MarriottBook >Marriott, Leo: ''Royal Navy Destroyers since 1945'', {{ISBN|0-7110-1817-0}}, Ian Allan Ltd, 1989</ref>\n\nEight ships were built and entered service. Two served in the [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|British naval task force]] in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. After leaving British service, four ships were sold to the Chilean Navy and one to the Pakistan Navy.\n\n==Design and development== \nA class of ten ships was envisaged in 1958 for about [[British pound|\u00a3]]6\u20137.5 million each,<ref>G. Moore. Daring to Devonshire in Warship 2006. Conway Maritime. (London) p124, 130</ref> equivalent to a costed programme for four large, Seaslug-armed, 15,000-ton cruisers, estimated at \u00a314 million each,{{sfn|Moore|2005| p124}} based on an upgraded [[Minotaur-class cruiser|''Minotaur''-class cruiser]] (1951), approved for full design in early 1955. The final four County-class ships, with hull numbers 07 to 10, were delayed in 1960 while an anti-submarine escort carrier was considered. Hulls 07 and 08 were approved in 1963 as a temporary stopgap,<ref>Moore. (2005) p 130 & ADM 167 162 1963</ref> and the ninth and tenth hulls were cancelled.\n\nThe class was designed as a hybrid cruiser-destroyer, with a much larger displacement  -similar to that of the [[Dido-class cruiser|''Dido''-class cruiser]] - than its predecessor, the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1949)|4}}. In 1955 the new [[First Sea Lord]] [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] specified the development of an April 1955, 4800 ton Fast fleet escort design (DNC 7/959) as a Seaslug carrying vessel with a Y stern positioned  twin 3/70 AA mount replaced by Seaslug (DNC 7/1002) {{sfn|Moore|2005|p=123}} instead of the then approved development of a large GW 58A 15,400 ton cruiser  <ref>Moore. Warship (2005), p 123</ref> which would have combined Seaslug with Type 984 3D radar and a conventional [[Tiger-class cruiser|''Tiger''-class]] gun armament.  During  1956\u20131958 a full \"alternative\" gun armament was an option for the new GW Fast Escort, {{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|pages=48\u201351}} based on a modern [[Combined steam and gas|combined gas turbine and steam turbine]] (COSAG) propulsion unit, as enlarged ''Daring'' fleet escorts, armed with two twin Mk 6 4.5-inch guns, two twin L/70 40mm Bofors and a twin 3-inch/70 guns. A detailed March 1957 study <ref>DNC 7/1014 for Board of Admiralty</ref> opted for a medium tensile {{convert|505|ft|abbr=on}} long hull and a fit of 18 Seaslug and 4 special (nuclear) Seaslug for extended range AA, anti-missile and anti-ship.<ref>DNC 7/1014</ref> twin Mk 5 Bofors 40mm were maintained with the future and effectiveness of the \"Green Light\" (which would become Seacat) missile, under doubt{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=127}} and [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] mortar was the only anti-submarine weapon.\n\nA revised design in March 1958 added Seaslug and [[Seacat missile]]s and added a telescopic hangar. Mountbatten staged an impressive demonstration shoot for [[flag officer]]s and politicians: the Seaslug test ship [[HMS Girdle Ness|HMS ''Girdle Ness'']] launched ten successive Seaslugs, including a salvo of two Seaslugs together. The success included hits in the lethal zone of two piston-engine [[Fairey Firefly]] radio-controlled drones, at {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} undemanding  targets with a speed of only 315/375&nbsp;mph.{{sfn |Grove |2005 |page=198}} This apparent success enabled the Minister of Defence [[Duncan Sandys]] to gain the approval of the Cabinet Defence Committee for Seaslug production to be approved in 1958.<ref>E. Grove. The RN Guided Missile in R. Harding RN 1930\u20132000. Innovation & Defense (2005), p. 198 by TNA:PRO. ADM 205/172 1958, (26) p. 211</ref>\n\nWhile the missile worked against Second World War-era level flying targets, the beam guidance system was dubious at range and in rough water which meant eight fixed stabilisers were added to the design of the County-class. Advocacy for the guided missiles fit{{sfnp|Wise|2007|pages=19\u201321}} was led by Mountbatten{{sfnp|Jane's|1980}} and the Cabinet agreed with using the system, despite staff reports over missile unreliability and inaccuracy,{{sfnp|Wise|2007|pages=19\u201321}} confirmed by the dismal performance in the following 1959 Seaslug target launches at [[Woomera]] in South Australia.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=198}}. Many Royal Australian Navy officers felt Seaslug was unsuitable for the RAN.{{sfnp|Moore|2005|pages=132\u2013133, note&nbsp;26, p.&nbsp;135}}\n\nFinal, late 1958 revisions to the design<ref>ADM 167 152 1958 and First Lords Record (Public Record Office)- the final, construction order, ship cover and legend no longer exist</ref> were to adopt a high flush deck from B turret, increasing internal space, the cancellation of the nuclear-tipped Seaslug, and provision for folding fins for the Seaslug, all allowing storage of 20 extra missile bodies in tubular form for rapid assembly. Against staff advice, a tight fitting, fixed side-hangar for the anti-submarine [[Westland Wessex]] helicopter was added on the insistence of the First Sea Lord.{{sfnp|Mountbatten|1989|page=187}} While a flawed layout, it proved usable when tested in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nLord Mountbatten classified the cruiser-sized County-class as destroyers rather than cruisers, although they had  destroyer-level fittings. Politically the ''Tiger''s and other cruisers were considered outdated empire relics, and with the apparently impressive performance of Seaslug against jet [[Gloster Meteor]] UC15 drones, Mountbatten could give the Royal Navy a large number of County-class 'destroyers' and a greater number of ship commands and posts for ambitious officers.{{sfnp|Wilson|2013|pages=624\u2013625}}\n\nWhile short on the support and logistic spares stocks of a traditional cruiser, they were still envisaged by the [[Director of Naval Construction]] as being 'probably' used in the cruiser role{{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|page=48}} with space for Flag staff offices, and admiral's barge accommodation{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|pages=181\u2013190}} in the 1960s: the last decade when the UK oversaw significant colonial territory (\"[[East of Suez]]\"). Its missile capability had been overtaken by aircraft development by 1962\u201363, when HMS ''Devonshire'' and ''Hampshire'' entered service, but in the early and mid-1960s the modern lines of these guided-missile destroyers, with their traditional RN cruiser style and their impressive-looking missiles, enabled the overstretched Royal Navy to project sufficient power to close down the threat of a militant, left-leaning Indonesia to Malaysia and Borneo during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]].<ref>N. van der Bijl. ''Confrontation. The War with Indonesia 1962\u201366''. Pen & Sword (2007) UK, pp 134\u20135, 139</ref>\n\n==Design features==\n[[File:HMS London, 1971 (IWM).jpg|thumb|''London'' leads ''Antrim'' and ''Norfolk'' during exercises in 1971]]\n\nThe County class was designed around the [[Seaslug missile|GWS1 Seaslug]] [[beam riding]] anti-aircraft missile system. Seaslug was a first-generation [[surface-to-air missile]] intended to hit high-flying nuclear-armed bombers and shadowing surveillance aircraft like the [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\"]], which could direct strikes against the British fleet from missile destroyers and cruise missile-armed submarines. {{cnspan|Bears were formidable targets for a missile like Seaslug|date=September 2018}}; the long-range Soviet turboprop aircraft flew at an altitude of {{convert|7.5|mi|ft m|abbr=on}}, at {{convert|572|mph|abbr=on}}<ref>Gunston, B.

Each missile was {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and weighed two tons; its handling arrangements and electronics systems were also large; so even fitting a single system aboard a ship the size of the Counties was a challenge. The missiles were stowed horizontally in a long unarmoured magazine which was sited above the waterline and took up a great deal of internal space. The risk of fire near the magazine was checked by an automatic sprinkler system.{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=129}} In order to increase the number of missiles that could be carried, on the last four ships, some of the missiles were stored partly disassembled in the forward end of the magazine. Their wings and fins would be reattached before being moved into the aft sections of the handling spaces and eventually loaded onto the large twin launcher for firing. \n\nThe limitations of the beam riding guidance method and lack of a homing head, meant the Mk 1 and 2 Seaslug were intended to have nuclear variants - the much larger blast compensating for lack of accuracy. However nuclear warhead for Mk 1 Seaslug (for the first group of ships) was dropped as it needed extra crew, space and security which were not available on the smaller hull; development of the nuclear warhead for Seaslug on the second group of ships was cancelled in June 1962,<ref>{{cite |first=R. |last=Moore |title=Nuclear.

First Lord Mountbatten doubted the usefulness of tactical nuclear weapons by 1962, due to escalation theories,scientific advice and greater evidence of fallout consequences, leading to the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. There were also staff and space difficulties with carrying nuclear warheads on confined destroyers.{{sfnp|Mountbatten|1989 }} As early as 1952, Air Chief Marshal [[John Slessor]] ([[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]) the most influential defence Advisor to Winston Churchill considered the Navy irrelevant in a nuclear war,{{sfn|Seldon |1981|p=334-5}} he first defined, the role of RN was \"uncertain\"{{sfn|Seldon |1981|p=334-5}}  as a pretext to maintain a large fleet and required only for political reasons.

However by 1962, the US was concentrating on the medium range radar guided [[RIM-24 Tartar|RIM-24 Tartar]] and long range [[RIM-8 Talos]], which had success against long range North Vietnamese aircraft from 1968.<ref>S.Tindle. USS Long Beach.The Last Cruiser, in Ships Monthly,Aug 2018,p40.</ref> The Royal Air Force's semi-active land-based [[Bristol Bloodhound]] was unrelated to Seaslug development, but drew top scientists away from RN work. \n\nThe County-class  design attempted to give maximum protection from nuclear fallout, with the operation rooms, where the ship was fought, located 5 decks below, deep in the ship, with a lift  from the bridge,{{sfnp|Marland|2016|page=77}} which maintained some duplicated command systems. The operations room, sited the main radar, sonar, electronic warfare screens and communication data and computer links.  The electronics required for the Seaslug were the large [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]] and the [[Type 965 radar|Type 965 air-search radar]]. These required a great deal of weight to be carried high up on the ship, further affecting ship layout. According to a RN Naval architect, \"Sea Slug did not live up to expectations\" and was obsolete by 1957.{{sfnp|Brown|Moore|2003|pages=39, 188}} The compromises required by the heavy and dated Seaslug system detracted from the success and popularity of an otherwise advanced ship design. Its ineffectiveness and vulnerable magazine{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=133}} and missile fuel, reduced confidence in the class, which had potential as command ships, having good seaworthiness, speed and in the group two County class a spacious  operations room with [[ADAWS]].\n\nIn 1960, because US-designed missiles were seen at the time to be superior to the Seaslug, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) proposed a County-class armed with the US Tartar missile and two additional modifications: hangar space for three [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters and a steam propulsion system, rather than the [[combined steam and gas]] system used in the County class. However, the RAN instead decided to proceed with the {{sclass-|Perth|destroyer|4}} (a modified version of the US {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|4}}). Two different reasons have been put forward for the Australian decision: according to an Australian history, British authorities would not allow a steam-propelled variant of the County,<ref>Cooper, Alastair; cited by Stevens, David, ed. (2001). ''The Royal Australian Navy. The Australian Centenary History of Defence'' (vol. III); South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, pp. 190\u20131</ref> whereas, according to a British account, the re-design required to accommodate the Tartar missile would have taken longer than the RAN deemed to be acceptable.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|pages=195}}\n\nThe US Terrier missile had some support amongst the RN staff, but consideration was not given to acquiring it for the second batch of four ships,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} as the County class were \"shop windows\" for advanced UK technology, and it was vital for the British missile and aerospace industry to continue the Sea Slug project, to allow the development of the much improved [[Sea Dart]] missile.  Following problems with the original version, a reworked Action Data Automation Weapon System (ADAWS) was successfully trialled on HMS ''Norfolk'' in 1970.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=191}} In the mid-1960s the County-class destroyers were assets; their impressive appearance and [[data link]]s, feeding off the carriers' [[Type 984 radar]], projected effective capability during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]].{{sfnp|Wilson|2013|pages=627 & spec}}{{sfn|Hall (December 2008)|page=50}} The Mark 1 Seaslug was operationally reliable and proved useful as a missile target for the new Sea Dart missiles in the late 1970s and early 1980s; the supersonic Mark 2 version proved less effective for this. There are questions as to whether it was ever fully operational and there were problems with missiles breaking up when the boosters separated.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=192}} Inaccuracy, primitive [[beam-riding guidance]] and lack of [[infrared homing]] or a [[proximity fuze]] in the Mk 1 made it of limited value.{{sfnp|Brown|Moore|2003|page=39}} Short-range air defence was provided by the [[Seacat (missile)#GWS-22|GWS-22 Seacat]] anti-aircraft missile system, which made the Counties the first Royal Navy warships to be armed with two different types of guided missile.\n\n===Batch 2 improvements===\n[[File:NAVO eskader bezoekt Amsterdam, vlaggeschip HNS Norfolk, Bestanddeelnr 928-6223.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Norfolk'', a Batch 2 ship, following modification that  removed the 'B' turret and replaced it with four Exocet laucher boxes]]\nAs constructed, the County-class ships were armed with a pair of twin [[QF 4.5 inch naval gun|QF 4.5-inch gun]] mountings. These had magazines for 225 shells for each gun, two-thirds of the magazine capacity for the same guns in the single-turreted [[Leander-class frigate|''Leander''-class frigate]]s.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=189}} The second batch of four ships (''Antrim'', ''Fife'', ''Glamorgan'' and ''Norfolk'') were refitted in the mid-1970s \u2013 their 'B'-position turrets were removed and replaced by four single [[Exocet|MM38 Exocet]] surface-to-surface anti-ship-missile launcher boxes in order to increase the fleets anti-ship capability following retirement of its aircraft carriers.{{sfnp|Marriott|1989|p=106}} This made the County-class ships the only Royal Navy ships to be fitted with three separate types of guided missile: Seaslug, Seacat and Exocet. It also left the un-refitted ships as the last Royal Navy vessels able to fire a broadside from multiple main armament gun turrets. HMS ''London'' fired the last Royal Navy broadside on  10 December 1981 in the [[English Channel]], after returning from its final deployment in the [[West Indies]].{{sfn|Hall (December 2008)|pages=51}} It had also fired off the last Seaslug Mk 1 stocks that year, as targets for Type 42 Sea Dart workups, prior to her hand-over to the [[Pakistani Navy]]. Sold by the British Government on 23 March 1982, she sailed without notice from Portsmouth in late May 1982 for Pakistan during the Falklands crisis, and consideration may have been given to reclaiming it for war service.\n\n===Possible development===\nIt was suggested by Vosper Thornycroft that the Counties could have been developed for the anti-submarine role by replacing the Seaslug system with a larger hangar and flight deck and the possibility of removing Seaslug and rebuilding the missile tunnel as storage for extra [[Westland Lynx]] helicopters.{{sfnp|Jane's|1980}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} Certainly, these arrangements as originally installed to operate a single [[Westland Wessex]] anti-submarine helicopter were problematic, with a hangar so cramped it took an hour to get the aircraft either in or out again, during which the port Seacat launcher was unusable. However it was determined that beam-restrictions would still limit the Counties' helicopter operation in RN service to the obsolescent Wessex, as they were too narrow to handle the far more capable [[Westland Sea King|British-built Sea King HAS]]. The Chilean navy, however, did convert two of the four ships they purchased along these lines.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Ships of the class==\nEight vessels were built in two batches between 1959 and 1970, the later four vessels carrying the improved Seaslug GWS2 and updated electronics requiring rearranged mastheads. The major identifying feature was the Batch 2 vessels' prominent \"double-bedstead\" AKE-2 antennas of the [[Type 965 radar|Type 965 air-search radar]], and their taller foremast carrying the Type 992Q low-angle search radar.\n\n===Ships' names===\n\nFour of the \"Counties\" had names which had been used by the famous interwar {{sclass2-|County|cruiser}}s: ''London'', ''Norfolk'', ''Devonshire'' and ''Kent''. (The last of that clas, {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}}, had survived until 1959 as a trials ship). ''Devonshire'', ''Hampshire'' and ''Antrim'' had been the names of  {{sclass-|Devonshire|cruiser (1903)|0}} [[armoured cruiser]]s of the [[First World War]].\n\nFour of the new ships were named after counties containing a [[Royal Navy Dockyard]]: [[Devonshire]] ([[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]]), [[Hampshire]] ([[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]]), ''Kent'' ([[Chatham Dockyard]]), and [[Fife]] ([[Rosyth dockyard]]). [[Glamorgan]] and [[Antrim]]  are the counties in Wales and Northern Ireland which contain the port cities and regional capitals of [[Cardiff]] and [[Belfast]] (by analogy to ''London'', England). [[Norfolk]] is the county of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s birth, and the important 19th-century ports of [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[King's Lynn]].\n\nThree of the ships' names have been subsequently re-used: {{HMS|London|F95|6}} was a [[Type 22 frigate]].  HMS ''Kent'' and HMS ''Norfolk'' were used for RN [[Type 23 frigate]]s though in their  case after [[List of dukedoms in the peerages of Britain and Ireland|British dukedoms]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Launched\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|-\n!rowspan=5|Batch 1\n|-\n|{{HMS|Devonshire|D02|2}}\n|[[Cammell Laird]], [[Birkenhead]]\n|9 March 1959\n|10 June 1960\n|15 November 1962\n|Sunk as target, 17 July 1984\n|-\n|{{HMS|Hampshire|D06|2}}\n|[[John Brown & Company]], [[Clydebank]]\n|26 March 1959\n|16 March 1961\n|15 March 1963\n|Broken up at [[Briton Ferry]], 1979\n|-\n|{{HMS|Kent|D12|2}}\n|[[Harland & Wolff]], [[Belfast]]\n|1 March 1960\n|27 September 1961\n|15 August 1963\n|Broken up at [[Alang]], 1998\n|-\n|{{HMS|London|D16|2}}\n|[[Swan Hunter]], [[Wallsend]]\n|26 February 1960\n|7 December 1961\n|4 November 1963\n|Sold to [[Pakistan Navy|Pakistan]] as ''Babur'', March 1982\n|-\n!rowspan=5|Batch 2\n|-\n|{{HMS|Fife|D20|2}}\n|[[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield Shipbuilding]], [[Govan]]\n|1 June 1962\n|9 July 1964\n|21 June 1966\n|Sold to [[Chilean Navy|Chile]] as ''Blanco Encalada'', August 1987\n|-\n|{{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|2}}\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]]\n|13 September 1962\n|9 July 1964\n|14 October 1966\n|Sold to Chile as ''Almirante Latorre'', September 1986\n|-\n|{{HMS|Antrim|D18|2}}\n|[[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]], [[Govan]]\n|20 January 1966\n|19 October 1967\n|14 July 1970\n|Sold to Chile as ''Almirante Cochrane'', June 1984\n|-\n|{{HMS|Norfolk|D21|2}}\n|Swan Hunter, Wallsend\n|15 March 1966\n|16 November 1967\n|7 March 1970\n|Sold to Chile as ''Capit\u00e1n Prat'', April 1982\n|}\n\n==Service==\n===1982 Falklands War===\n\n''Antrim'' and ''Glamorgan'' both served in the [[Falklands War]]; ''Antrim'' was the flagship of [[Operation Paraquet]], the recovery of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] in April 1982. Her helicopter, a [[Westland Wessex]] HAS Mk 3 (nicknamed \"Humphrey\") was responsible for the rescue of 16 [[Special Air Service]] operators from Fortuna Glacier and the subsequent detection and disabling of the [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|Argentinian submarine ''Santa Fe'']]. In San Carlos Water, ''Antrim'' was hit by a 1,000&nbsp;lb (450&nbsp;kg) bomb which failed to explode. ''Glamorgan'', after many days on the \"gun line\" bombarding [[Port Stanley]] airfield, was hit by an Exocet launched from land at the end of the conflict. It destroyed her aircraft hangar and the port Seacat mounting. Her captain's prompt reaction to visual detection of the Exocet narrowly averted a hit on the fatally vulnerable Seaslug magazine, by turning the ship so as to give as small a target as possible (the stern) to the incoming weapon. The ship suffered fourteen deaths, injuries, and was lucky to survive with extensive damage and flooding. Had the missile hit a few inches higher, the above waterline magazine would have blown in an explosive fireball and many more of the crew{{sfn|Hall (May 2008)|page=51}} might have been lost.\n\n===Disposal===\nAll eight of the class had short Royal Navy careers, serving on average less than 16 years. Only ''London'' of the first batch would serve further (transferred to Pakistan) while the other three Batch 1 ships were decommissioned by 1980 with ''Hampshire'' being immediately scrapped in 1977 after cannibalization for spares, and ''Devonshire'' sunk in weapons testing in 1984. ''Kent'' would serve as a floating (though immobile) accommodation and training ship in [[Portsmouth]] harbour until 1996.  The four ships of Batch 2 however would be operated for 16 to 23 more years after sale to the [[Chilean Navy]], in which they all received extensive upgrades and modernisation.\n\n==Construction programme==\nThe ships were built at the major UK yards, with some of the machinery coming from [[Associated Electrical Industries]] of Manchester, [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company]] of Wallsend-on-Tyne, [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]] of Southampton, [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrows]] of Glasgow, and the [[Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company]], Wallsend-on-Tyne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+County-class ships<ref name=NE1963>''Navy Estimates, 1963\u201364'', page 70, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1963''</ref>{{sfnp|Moore|2005|page=133}}<ref name=DE1964 >''Defence Estimates, 1964\u201365'', page 72, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1964''</ref><ref name=DE1967>''Defence Estimates, 1967\u201368'', page 75, ''Table 3 (Programme): List and particulars of new ships which have been accepted or are expected to be accepted into HM service during the Financial Year ended 31 March 1967''</ref>\n|-valign=top\n!

that it is based on moral values and advocacy of [[universal access to education]], [[civil society]], tolerance and peace. The emphasis among participants is to perform \"service\" (also the meaning of the Turkish word \"hizmet\" in Turkish) as arising from individuals' personal commitments to righteous imperatives. Along with ''hizmet,'' the movement, which has no official name, is termed the G\u00fclen movement or ''[[cemaat]]'' (the latter also used to describe participants in [[Sufi]] orders, meaning \"congregation,\" \"community,\" or \"assembly.\")The movement has been characterized as a \"moderate blend of Islam\".<ref name=nyt080504>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/world/asia/04islam.html?ex=1367640000&en=625b88103a702f94&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink |  first=Sabrina | last=Tavernise | authorlink=Sabrina Tavernise | title=Turkish Schools Offer Pakistan a Gentler Vision of Islam | date=4 May 2008 | work=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=tavernise>{{cite web|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/podcasts/2008/04/25/25worldview.mp3|title=Interview with Sabrina Tavernise, World View Podcasts, New York Times, May 4, 2008}}</ref> G\u00fclen and the G\u00fclen movement are technology-friendly, work within current market and commerce structures, and are savvy users of modern communications and public relations.<ref name=prospect>Ehsan Masood, [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/amodernottoman A modern Ottoman], ''Prospect'', Issue 148, July 2008</ref> In 2008, G\u00fclen was described as \"the modern face of the Sufi Ottoman tradition\", who reassures his followers, including many members of \"Turkey's aspirational middle class\", that \"they can combine the statist-nationalist beliefs of Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s republic with a traditional but flexible Islamic faith\" and \"Ottoman traditions that had been caricatured as theocratic by [[Atat\u00fcrk]] and his '[[Kemalist]]' heirs\".<ref name=prospect/>\n\nWithin Turkey the G\u00fclen movement keeps its distance from established Islamic political parties.<ref>Clement M.

It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Jamnagar District]]. Jamnagar is the largest city on the westernmost side of India and is the fifth largest city of Gujarat state after [[Ahmedabad]], [[Surat]], [[Vadodara]] and [[Rajkot]].\n\nThe modern look of the city was initially given by H.H. Jam Ranjitsinhji. He was instrumental in building the modern infrastructure of the city during his reign in the 1920s. Thereafter, the city was substantially developed by Jam Saheb Shri [[Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji]] in the 1940s, when it was part of the [[Princely state]] of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]]. The city lies just to the south of the [[Gulf of Kutch]], some {{convert|337|km}} west of the state capital, [[Gandhinagar]].\n\nIndia's largest private company, [[Reliance Industries]], has established the world's largest [[Jamnagar Refinery|Oil Refining and Petrochemicals Complex]] near the village of Moti Khavdi in Jamnagar district.<ref>Reliance Industries Limited \u2013 Jamnagar {{cite web |url=http://www.ril.com/html/aboutus/manufact_jamnagar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024225136/http://www.ril.com/html/aboutus/manufact_jamnagar.html |archivedate=24 October 2008 }}</ref> The [[Essar Refinery|Nayara Energy refinery]] which is the second largest private refinery in India is located in the nearby town of [[Vadinar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/essar/ |title=Essar Oil Refinery, Vadinar, Gujarat |publisher=Hydrocarbons Technology |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref> The [[Nayara Energy]] (formerly [[Essar Oil]]) Refinery is supplemented by its own Thermal Power Plant and a private port for handling crude oil.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Nawanagar State}}\n[[File:Ranjitsinhji.jpg|thumb|left|Maharaja Jamsaheb Shri Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar]]\n[[File:Ranjitsinh.jpeg|320x240px|thumbnail|Picture of Ranjitsinhji, celebrated cricketer and Maharaja of Nawanagar.]]\n[[File:Flag of Nawanagar.png|thumb|left|Flag of the Princely State of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]]]]\n\n\nNawanagar was founded by Jam Rawal in 1540 as the capital of the eponymous [[Princely state]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rosemary Crill|author2=Kapil Jariwala|title=The Indian Portrait, 1560\u20131860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ongF6dkNKAcC|year=2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-81-89995-37-9|page=88}}</ref> Jamnagar, historically known as Nawanagar (the new town), was one of the most important and the largest Princely states of the [[Jadeja]]s in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]]. It was a 13 gun salute state. According to Pauranik literature, [[Lord Krishna]] established his kingdom at [[Dwarka|Dwarka town]] in Jamnagar district, after migrating from [[Mathura]], and accordingly, it is to the [[Yadava]] race that the Jams of Nawanagar trace their ancestry.\n\nAccording to historical records, Bahadurshah, the emperor of [[Gujarat]], bestowed upon Jam Lakhaji twelve villages in recognition of his role in the siege of [[Pawagadh]]. Jam Lakhaji, however, was killed by his cousins, Tamachi Deda and Jam Hamirji Jadeja, after he took possession of the villages. His son, Jam Rawal, thereafter murdered his father's killers and became ruler of [[Cutch State|Cutch]].\n\nHamirji's two sons Khengarji and Sahibji fled to [[Delhi]] to pay obeisance to the Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]]. During a lion hunt, the two brothers saved the Emperor from being killed by a lion. As a reward for their valor, an army was sent with them to regain their kingdom. When Jam Sri Rawalji heard of the two princes coming back to the Kutch with the imperial army, he prepared for battle.\n\nOne night, Goddess Ashapuraji, the supreme deity of the Jadeja Clan of [[Rajputs]], came to Jam Sri Rawalji in a dream and told him that although he had broken an oath taken in her name not to kill Hamirji, even though he was the person responsible for his death, she had refrained from punishing him because he had at all other times honoured her, but he was no longer to dwell in Cutch.\n\nJam Sri Rawalji and his entourage marched out of Cutch, attacked and killed Tamachi deda, the main conspirator in the killing of his father, and conquered the town of Amran and its dependencies. Jam Sri Rawalji bestowed the rule of Dhrol province on his younger brother Hardholji, who was later killed in battle at Mithoi near Khambhalia, whereupon the throne passed on to his eldest son, Jasoji. Jam hri Rawalji conquered parts of Saurashtra and formed his kingdom with 999 villages named it as [[Halar]].\n\nOnce on a hunting trip in present-day Jamnagar, a hare was found to be brave enough to turn on the hunting dogs and put them to flight. Deeply impressed by this, Jam Sri Rawalji thought that if this land could breed such hares, the men born here would be superior to other men, and accordingly he made this place his capital.\n\nOn the seventh day of the bright half of the month of [[Shrawan (Nepali calendar)|Shrawan]], [[Vikram Samvat|V.S.]] 1956 (August 1540) on the banks of the rivers Rangmati and Nagmati, he laid the foundation of his new capital and named it Nawanagar (new town), which after few centuries came to be known as ''Jamnagar'', meaning the town of the JAM's.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nJamnagar has a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: BSh).

It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Jamnagar District]]. Jamnagar is the largest city on the westernmost side of India and is the fifth largest city of Gujarat state after [[Ahmedabad]], [[Surat]], [[Vadodara]] and [[Rajkot]].\n\nThe modern look of the city was initially given by H.H. Jam Ranjitsinhji. He was instrumental in building the modern infrastructure of the city during his reign in the 1920s. Thereafter, the city was substantially developed by Jam Saheb Shri [[Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji]] in the 1940s, when it was part of the [[Princely state]] of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]]. The city lies just to the south of the [[Gulf of Kutch]], some {{convert|337|km}} west of the state capital, [[Gandhinagar]].\n\nIndia's largest private company, [[Reliance Industries]], has established the world's largest [[Jamnagar Refinery|Oil Refining and Petrochemicals Complex]] near the village of Moti Khavdi in Jamnagar district.<ref>Reliance Industries Limited \u2013 Jamnagar {{cite web |url=http://www.ril.com/html/aboutus/manufact_jamnagar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024225136/http://www.ril.com/html/aboutus/manufact_jamnagar.html |archivedate=24 October 2008 }}</ref> The [[Essar Refinery|Nayara Energy refinery]] which is the second largest private refinery in India is located in the nearby town of [[Vadinar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/essar/ |title=Essar Oil Refinery, Vadinar, Gujarat |publisher=Hydrocarbons Technology |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref> The [[Nayara Energy]] (formerly [[Essar Oil]]) Refinery is supplemented by its own Thermal Power Plant and a private port for handling crude oil.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Nawanagar State}}\n[[File:Ranjitsinhji.jpg|thumb|left|Maharaja Jamsaheb Shri Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar]]\n[[File:Ranjitsinh.jpeg|320x240px|thumbnail|Picture of Ranjitsinhji, celebrated cricketer and Maharaja of Nawanagar.]]\n[[File:Flag of Nawanagar.png|thumb|left|Flag of the Princely State of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]]]]\n\n\nNawanagar was founded by Jam Rawal in 1540 as the capital of the eponymous [[Princely state]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rosemary Crill|author2=Kapil Jariwala|title=The Indian Portrait, 1560\u20131860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ongF6dkNKAcC|year=2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-81-89995-37-9|page=88}}</ref> Jamnagar, historically known as Nawanagar (the new town), was one of the most important and the largest Princely states of the [[Jadeja]]s in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]]. It was a 13 gun salute state. According to Pauranik literature, [[Lord Krishna]] established his kingdom at [[Dwarka|Dwarka town]] in Jamnagar district, after migrating from [[Mathura]], and accordingly, it is to the [[Yadava]] race that the Jams of Nawanagar trace their ancestry.\n\nAccording to historical records, Bahadurshah, the emperor of [[Gujarat]], bestowed upon Jam Lakhaji twelve villages in recognition of his role in the siege of [[Pawagadh]]. Jam Lakhaji, however, was killed by his cousins, Tamachi Deda and Jam Hamirji Jadeja, after he took possession of the villages. His son, Jam Rawal, thereafter murdered his father's killers and became ruler of [[Cutch State|Cutch]].\n\nHamirji's two sons Khengarji and Sahibji fled to [[Delhi]] to pay obeisance to the Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]]. During a lion hunt, the two brothers saved the Emperor from being killed by a lion. As a reward for their valor, an army was sent with them to regain their kingdom. When Jam Sri Rawalji heard of the two princes coming back to the Kutch with the imperial army, he prepared for battle.\n\nOne night, Goddess Ashapuraji, the supreme deity of the Jadeja Clan of [[Rajputs]], came to Jam Sri Rawalji in a dream and told him that although he had broken an oath taken in her name not to kill Hamirji, even though he was the person responsible for his death, she had refrained from punishing him because he had at all other times honoured her, but he was no longer to dwell in Cutch.\n\nJam Sri Rawalji and his entourage marched out of Cutch, attacked and killed Tamachi deda, the main conspirator in the killing of his father, and conquered the town of Amran and its dependencies. Jam Sri Rawalji bestowed the rule of Dhrol province on his younger brother Hardholji, who was later killed in battle at Mithoi near Khambhalia, whereupon the throne passed on to his eldest son, Jasoji. Jam hri Rawalji conquered parts of Saurashtra and formed his kingdom with 999 villages named it as [[Halar]].\n\nOnce on a hunting trip in present-day Jamnagar, a hare was found to be brave enough to turn on the hunting dogs and put them to flight. Deeply impressed by this, Jam Sri Rawalji thought that if this land could breed such hares, the men born here would be superior to other men, and accordingly he made this place his capital.\n\nOn the seventh day of the bright half of the month of [[Shrawan (Nepali calendar)|Shrawan]], [[Vikram Samvat|V.S.]] 1956 (August 1540) on the banks of the rivers Rangmati and Nagmati, he laid the foundation of his new capital and named it Nawanagar (new town), which after few centuries came to be known as ''Jamnagar'', meaning the town of the JAM's.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nJamnagar has a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: BSh).
