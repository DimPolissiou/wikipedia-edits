This union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters. Oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required [[Metabolism|metabolic]] machinery. Thus, the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment (sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide). In microaerophilic conditions, oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform. The bacterium on the other hand, contributed the necessary [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products and [[electron]] acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming [[motility]] for the organism.\n\nFrom a consortium of bacterial and archaeal DNA originated the nuclear [[genome]] of eukaryotic cells.

The host utilized [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) to produce [[methane]] while the symbiont, capable of aerobic respiration, expelled H<sub>2</sub> and {{CO2}} as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process. The host's methanogenic environment worked as a sink for H<sub>2</sub>, which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation.\n\nEndosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts' [[carbohydrate]] metabolism and turn [[heterotroph]]ic in nature. Subsequently, the host's methane forming capability was lost. Thus, the origins of the heterotrophic organelle (symbiont) are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. In this hypothesis, the presence of H<sub>2</sub> represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes.{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}\n\n=====The syntrophy hypothesis=====\nThe syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events. According to this theory, the origin of eukaryotic cells was based on metabolic symbiosis (syntrophy) between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium. This syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by H<sub>2</sub> transfer between different species under anaerobic environments. In earlier stages, an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration, and later developed into the mitochondrion. [[Gene]] transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus. The archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus, while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the [[cytoplasm]]ic features.\n\nThis theory incorporates two selective forces at the time of nucleus [[evolution]]\n* presence of metabolic partitioning to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of [[Anabolism|anabolic]] and [[Catabolism|catabolic]] cellular pathways, and\n* prevention of abnormal [[protein biosynthesis]] due to a vast spread of [[intron]]s in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and losing [[methanogenesis]].{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}\n\n=====6+ serial endosymbiosis scenario=====\nPitts and Galban\u00f3n propose a complex scenario of 6+ serial endosymbiotic events of Archaea and bacteria in which mitochondria and an asgard related archaeota were acquired at a late stage of eukaryogenesis, possibly in combination, as a secondary endosymbiote.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pittis AA, Gabald\u00f3n T |title=Late acquisition of mitochondria by a host with chimaeric prokaryotic ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=531 |issue=7592 |pages=101\u2013104 |date=March 2016 |pmid=26840490 |pmc=4780264 |doi=10.1038/nature16941 |bibcode=2016Natur.531..101P}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXzGDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA133 |title=Evolution since coding: Cradles, halos, barrels, and wings |last=Burton |first=Zachary F. |name-list-format=vanc |date=1 August 2017 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780128130346}}</ref> The findings have been rebuked as an artefact.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin WF, Roettger M, Ku C, Garg SG, Nelson-Sathi S, Landan G |title=Late mitochondrial origin is an artifact |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=373\u2013379 |date=February 2017 |pmid=28199635 |pmc=5516564 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx027}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Eukaryote hybrid genome]]\n* [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]]\n* [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes]]\n* [[Parakaryon myojinensis|Parakaryon]]\n* [[Prokaryote]]\n* [[Thaumarchaeota]]\n* [[Vault (organelle)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- SystBiol56:389. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{NCBI-scienceprimer}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies|Eukaryota}}\n* [http://www.tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3 \"Eukaryotes\"] ([[Tree of Life Web Project]])\n* {{EOL}}\n\n{{Life}}\n{{Excavata}}\n{{Plant classification}}\n{{Cryptophyta and haptophyta}}\n{{Heterokont}}\n{{Alveolata}}\n{{Amoebozoa}}\n{{Opisthokont protists}}\n{{Animalia}}\n{{Fungi classification}}\n{{Life on Earth}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q19088}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eukaryotes| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Domains (biology)|Eukaryote]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Organism whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes}}\n{{redirect|Eukaryotic cell|the journal|Eukaryotic Cell (journal)}}\n{{pp-move-indef|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2017}}\n{{automatic taxobox\n| name=Eukaryote\n| fossil_range=[[Orosirian]] \u2013 [[Holocene|Present]] {{long fossil range|1850|0 |earliest=2700}}\n| image=Eukaryota diversity 2.jpg\n| image_caption=Eukaryotes and some examples of their diversity \u2013 clockwise from top left: [[Osmia bicornis|Red mason bee]], ''[[Boletus edulis]]'', [[chimpanzee]], ''[[Isotricha intestinalis]]'', ''[[Ranunculus asiaticus]]'', and ''[[Volvox carteri]]''\n| taxon=Eukaryota\n| authority=([[\u00c9douard Chatton|Chatton]], 1925) [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]] & [[Lynn Margulis|Margulis]], 1978\n| subdivision_ranks=[[Kingdom (biology)#Kingdoms of the Eukaryota|Supergroups]]<ref name=\"Adl2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Adl SM, Simpson AG, Lane CE, Luke\u0161 J, Bass D, Bowser SS, Brown MW, Burki F, Dunthorn M, Hampl V, Heiss A, Hoppenrath M, Lara E, Le Gall L, Lynn DH, McManus H, Mitchell EA, Mozley-Stanridge SE, Parfrey LW, Pawlowski J, Rueckert S, Shadwick L, Shadwick L, Schoch CL, Smirnov A, Spiegel FW | display-authors = 6 | title = The revised classification of eukaryotes | journal = The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 429\u201393 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23020233 | pmc = 3483872 | doi = 10.1111/j.1550-7408.2012.00644.x | url = http://www.paru.cas.cz/docs/documents/93-Adl-JEM-2012.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160616160800/http://www.paru.cas.cz/docs/documents/93-Adl-JEM-2012.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date = 16 June 2016 }}</ref> and [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]\n| subdivision =\n* <div style=\"background: {{Taxobox colour|Archaeplastida}};

Flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as [[undulipodia]],<ref>[[Lynn Margulis]], Heather I.

They are composed mainly of [[tubulin]]. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a [[centriole]], characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets. Flagella also may have hairs, or [[mastigonemes]], and scales connecting membranes and internal rods. Their interior is continuous with the cell's [[cytoplasm]].\n\nMicrofilamental structures composed of [[actin]] and actin binding proteins, e.g., \u03b1-[[actinin]], [[fimbrin]], [[filamin]] are present in submembraneous cortical layers and bundles, as well. [[Motor protein]]s of microtubules, e.g., [[dynein]] or [[kinesin]] and actin, e.g., [[myosins]] provide dynamic character of the network.\n\n[[Centrioles]] are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella, but [[conifer]]s and [[angiosperm|flowering plants]] have neither. They generally occur in groups that give rise to various microtubular roots. These form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure, and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions, with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it. Centrioles produce the spindle during nuclear division.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Vorobjev IA, Nadezhdina ES | title = The centrosome and its role in the organization of microtubules | volume = 106 | pages = 227\u2013293 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3294718 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7696(08)61714-3 | isbn = 978-0-12-364506-7 | series = International Review of Cytology }}</ref>\n\nThe significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells, as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like [[chemotaxis]] and [[chemokinesis]].

This union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters. Oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required [[Metabolism|metabolic]] machinery. Thus, the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment (sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide). In microaerophilic conditions, oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform. The bacterium on the other hand, contributed the necessary [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products and [[electron]] acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming [[motility]] for the organism.\n\nFrom a consortium of bacterial and archaeal DNA originated the nuclear [[genome]] of eukaryotic cells. [[Spirochete]]s gave rise to the motile features of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic unifications of the ancestors of alpha-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, led to the origin of mitochondria and [[plastid]]s respectively. For example, ''Thiodendron'' has been known to have originated via an [[Ectosymbiosis|ectosymbiotic]] process based on a similar [[syntrophy]] of sulfur existing between the two types of bacteria \u2013 ''Desulphobacter'' and ''Spirochaeta''.\n\nHowever, such an association based on motile symbiosis have never been observed practically. Also there is no evidence of archaeans and spirochetes adapting to intense acid-based environments.<ref name=latorre>{{cite book |vauthors=Latorre A, Durban A, Moya A, Pereto J |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3oFebknu1cC&pg=PA326 |chapter=The role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |title=Origins and Evolution of Life: An astrobiological perspective |editor-last1=Gargaud |editor-first1=Muriel |editor-last2=L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eca |editor-first2=Purificaci\u00f3n |editor-last3=Martin |editor-first3=Herv\u00e9 |name-list-format=vanc |year=2011 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=326\u2013339 |isbn=978-0-521-76131-4}}</ref>\n\n=====The hydrogen hypothesis=====\nIn the hydrogen hypothesis, the symbiotic linkage of an anaerobic and [[autotroph]]ic methanogenic archaeon (host) with an alpha-proteobacterium (the symbiont) gave rise to the eukaryotes. The host utilized [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) to produce [[methane]] while the symbiont, capable of aerobic respiration, expelled H<sub>2</sub> and {{CO2}} as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process. The host's methanogenic environment worked as a sink for H<sub>2</sub>, which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation.\n\nEndosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts' [[carbohydrate]] metabolism and turn [[heterotroph]]ic in nature. Subsequently, the host's methane forming capability was lost. Thus, the origins of the heterotrophic organelle (symbiont) are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. In this hypothesis, the presence of H<sub>2</sub> represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes.{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}\n\n=====The syntrophy hypothesis=====\nThe syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events. According to this theory, the origin of eukaryotic cells was based on metabolic symbiosis (syntrophy) between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium. This syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by H<sub>2</sub> transfer between different species under anaerobic environments. In earlier stages, an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration, and later developed into the mitochondrion. [[Gene]] transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus. The archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus, while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the [[cytoplasm]]ic features.\n\nThis theory incorporates two selective forces at the time of nucleus [[evolution]]\n* presence of metabolic partitioning to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of [[Anabolism|anabolic]] and [[Catabolism|catabolic]] cellular pathways, and\n* prevention of abnormal [[protein biosynthesis]] due to a vast spread of [[intron]]s in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and losing [[methanogenesis]].{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}\n\n=====6+ serial endosymbiosis scenario=====\nPitts and Galban\u00f3n propose a complex scenario of 6+ serial endosymbiotic events of Archaea and bacteria in which mitochondria and an asgard related archaeota were acquired at a late stage of eukaryogenesis, possibly in combination, as a secondary endosymbiote.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pittis AA, Gabald\u00f3n T |title=Late acquisition of mitochondria by a host with chimaeric prokaryotic ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=531 |issue=7592 |pages=101\u2013104 |date=March 2016 |pmid=26840490 |pmc=4780264 |doi=10.1038/nature16941 |bibcode=2016Natur.531..101P}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXzGDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA133 |title=Evolution since coding: Cradles, halos, barrels, and wings |last=Burton |first=Zachary F. |name-list-format=vanc |date=1 August 2017 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780128130346}}</ref> The findings have been rebuked as an artefact.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin WF, Roettger M, Ku C, Garg SG, Nelson-Sathi S, Landan G |title=Late mitochondrial origin is an artifact |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=373\u2013379 |date=February 2017 |pmid=28199635 |pmc=5516564 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx027}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Eukaryote hybrid genome]]\n* [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]]\n* [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes]]\n* [[Parakaryon myojinensis|Parakaryon]]\n* [[Prokaryote]]\n* [[Thaumarchaeota]]\n* [[Vault (organelle)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- SystBiol56:389. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{NCBI-scienceprimer}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies|Eukaryota}}\n* [http://www.tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3 \"Eukaryotes\"] ([[Tree of Life Web Project]])\n* {{EOL}}\n\n{{Life}}\n{{Excavata}}\n{{Plant classification}}\n{{Cryptophyta and haptophyta}}\n{{Heterokont}}\n{{Alveolata}}\n{{Amoebozoa}}\n{{Opisthokont protists}}\n{{Animalia}}\n{{Fungi classification}}\n{{Life on Earth}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q19088}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eukaryotes| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Domains (biology)|Eukaryote]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Robert Whittaker", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"}

The most notable feature about the Bologna side was the presence of superstar [[Roberto Baggio]], who flourished when getting out of a terrible spell at [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. He scored 22 out of the teams' 55 goals, before leaving for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] at the end of the season. Given that fellow strikers [[Kennet Andersson]] and [[Igor Kolyvanov]] also impressed, Bologna could live with losing Baggio. Other well-performing players included goalkeeper [[Francesco Antonioli]], defender [[Michele Paramatti]] and playmaker [[Carlo Nervo]].\n\n==Squad==\n\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Francesco Antonioli]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Alex Brunner]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giorgio Sterchele]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Daniele Carnasciali]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Amedeo Mangone]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Paganin]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Michele Paramatti]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Tarantino]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Stefano Torrisi]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Brambilla]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Paolo Cristallini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Antonio Foschini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giuliano Gentilini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Davide Fontolan]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Oscar Magoni]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Carlo Nervo]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=URU|no=|name=[[Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez (footballer)|Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Antonio Maschio]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=RUS|no=|name=[[Igor Shalimov]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giancarlo Marocchi]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Roberto Baggio]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=SWE|no=|name=[[Kennet Andersson]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=RUS|no=|name=[[Igor Kolyvanov]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=Sierra Leone|no=|name=[[Mohamed Kallon]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Competitions==\n\n===Serie A===\n{{main|1997\u201398 Serie A}}\n\n====League table====\n{{:1997\u201398 Serie A|showteam=BOL}}\n====Matches====\n\n{{legend2|#BBF3BB|Win|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFFFBB|Draw|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFBBBB|Loss|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{{football box collapsible\n|round      = 1\n|date       = {{Start date|1997|8|31|df=y}}\n|team1      = [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]\n|score      = 4\u20132\n|report=http://www.legaseriea.it/it/serie-a-tim/match-report/1997-98/UNICO/UNI/1/ATABOL\n|team2      = [[Bologna Football Club 1909|Bologna]]\n|goals1     = [[Nicola Caccia|Caccia]] {{goal|27|pen.}}<br />[[Massimo Orlando|Orlando]] {{goal|48}}<br />[[Marco Sgr\u00f2|Sgr\u00f2]] {{goal|79}}<br />[[Cristiano Lucarelli|Lucarelli]] {{goal|93}}\n|goals2     = [[Kennet Andersson|Andersson]] {{goal|85}}<br />[[Roberto Baggio|R.

He scored 22 out of the teams' 55 goals, before leaving for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] at the end of the season. Given that fellow strikers [[Kennet Andersson]] and [[Igor Kolyvanov]] also impressed, Bologna could live with losing Baggio. Other well-performing players included goalkeeper [[Francesco Antonioli]], defender [[Michele Paramatti]] and playmaker [[Carlo Nervo]].\n\n==Squad==\n\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Francesco Antonioli]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Alex Brunner]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giorgio Sterchele]] |pos=GK }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Daniele Carnasciali]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Amedeo Mangone]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Paganin]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Michele Paramatti]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Tarantino]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Stefano Torrisi]] |pos=DF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Massimo Brambilla]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Paolo Cristallini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Antonio Foschini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giuliano Gentilini]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Davide Fontolan]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Oscar Magoni]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Carlo Nervo]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=URU|no=|name=[[Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez (footballer)|Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Antonio Maschio]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=RUS|no=|name=[[Igor Shalimov]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Giancarlo Marocchi]] |pos=MF }}\n{{fs player|nat=ITA|no=|name=[[Roberto Baggio]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=SWE|no=|name=[[Kennet Andersson]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=RUS|no=|name=[[Igor Kolyvanov]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs player|nat=Sierra Leone|no=|name=[[Mohamed Kallon]] |pos=FW }}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Competitions==\n\n===Serie A===\n{{main|1997\u201398 Serie A}}\n\n====League table====\n{{:1997\u201398 Serie A|showteam=BOL}}\n====Matches====\n\n{{legend2|#BBF3BB|Win|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFFFBB|Draw|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFBBBB|Loss|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{{football box collapsible\n|round      = 1\n|date       = {{Start date|1997|8|31|df=y}}\n|team1      = [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]\n|score      = 4\u20132\n|report=http://www.legaseriea.it/it/serie-a-tim/match-report/1997-98/UNICO/UNI/1/ATABOL\n|team2      = [[Bologna Football Club 1909|Bologna]]\n|goals1     = [[Nicola Caccia|Caccia]] {{goal|27|pen.}}<br />[[Massimo Orlando|Orlando]] {{goal|48}}<br />[[Marco Sgr\u00f2|Sgr\u00f2]] {{goal|79}}<br />[[Cristiano Lucarelli|Lucarelli]] {{goal|93}}\n|goals2     = [[Kennet Andersson|Andersson]] {{goal|85}}<br />[[Roberto Baggio|R.
