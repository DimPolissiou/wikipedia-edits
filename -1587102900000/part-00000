One of the beings told Smith not to join any existing churches because all taught incorrect doctrines.\n\nSmith wrote several accounts of the vision between 1832 and 1842, two of which were published in his lifetime. <ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/first-vision-accounts |title= First Vision Accounts |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref> Consistency of the accounts is a subject of debate, whether variations are indicators of significant shifts in Smith's theology or are simply changing emphasis of minor details. <ref>James B.

Online at: http://signaturebookslibrary.org/inventing-mormonism-01/</ref>  Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\".<ref>{{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}</ref> In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820.<ref>{{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> <ref>For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\n====Dating the Revival====\n[[File:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Typical scene from a Methodist camp meeting]]\n[[Richard Bushman]] wrote that Smith \"began to be concerned about religion in late 1817 or early 1818, when the aftereffects of the revival of 1816 and 1817 were still being felt.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=37}}</ref> [[Milton V. Backman]] wrote that religious outbreaks occurred in 1819\u201320 within a fifty-mile radius of Smith's home: \"Church records, newspapers, religious journals, and other contemporary sources clearly reveal that great awakenings occurred in more than fifty western New York towns or villages during the revival of 1819\u20131820 .... Primary sources also specify that great multitudes joined the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Calvinist Baptist societies in the region of country where Joseph Smith lived.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Backman|1969|p=11}}</ref> [[Richard Lloyd Anderson]] has pointed out that there was a Methodist Camp Meeting in Palmyra in 1818, with about 400 in attendance, that is verified by a contemporary journal.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured [sic] of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened.

Allen]] notes that:\n\n<blockquote> The fact that none of the available contemporary writings about Joseph Smith in the 1830s, none of the publications of the Church in that decade, and no contemporary journal or correspondence yet discovered mentions the story of the first vision is convincing evidence that at best it received only limited circulation in those early days.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1830s reference to early Christian regeneration===\n\nIn June 1830, Smith provided the first clear record of a significant personal religious experience prior to the visit of the [[angel Moroni]].<ref>The account was first published to non-Mormons in 1831. {{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref> At that time, Smith and his associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] were establishing the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the first [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] church.  In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided. Although the reference was later linked to the First Vision,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Allen|1980|p=45}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=39, 112}}.</ref> its original hearers would have understood the manifestation as simply another of many revival experiences in which the subject testified that his sins had been forgiven.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.</ref>\n\n===1832 Smith account===\nThe earliest extant account of the First Vision was handwritten by Smith in 1832 in a letter book, but its existence was not known outside the Church History department until it was published in 1965.<ref>\"One of the most significant documents of that period yet discovered was brought to light in 1965 by [[Paul R. Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S. Church Historian's office for many years, and yet few if any who saw it realized its profound historical significance.\" {{harv|Allen|1966|p=35}}</ref>  Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian's collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].  In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.  In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master's thesis.  The Tanner's obtained a copy of the thesis transcript and the account was published for the first time in 1965.<ref>Stan Larson ''Another Look at Joseph Smith's First Vision'' Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer 2014), pp. 37-62.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

Porter, the Methodist minister, George Lane, may have passed very near the Smith home and preached at a camp meeting along the way in July 1820. \"In the pursuit of his ministerial duties Rev. Lane was in the geographical proximity of Joseph Smith on a number of occasions between the years 1819-1825. The nature degree or indeed the actuality of their acquaintanceship during this interval poses a number of interesting possibilities ....

The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination. (These accounts are available {{harvnb|Vogel|1996}})</ref> LDS historian [[Richard Bushman]] wrote, \"At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation and use by the LDS Church===\nAccording to the LDS Church, the vision teaches that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone; that mankind was literally created in the image of God; that Satan is real but God infinitely greater; that God hears and answers prayer; that no other contemporary church had the fullness of Christ's gospel; and that revelation has not ceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the 21st century, the vision features prominently in the Church's program of proselytism.<ref>{{harvnb|Widmer|2000|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAn official website of the LDS Church calls the First Vision \"the greatest event in world history since the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://josephsmith.net/article/the-first-vision |title=The First Vision |date=9 September 2013 |work=JosephSmith.net |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> In 1998, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B.

It was the parting of the curtain to open this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration. I submit that if Joseph Smith talked with God the Father and His Beloved Son, then all else of which he spoke is true.

And that's exactly where we stand, with a conviction in our hearts that it is true: that Joseph went into the [Sacred] Grove; that he saw the Father and the Son; that he talked with them; that Moroni came; that the Book of Mormon was translated from the plates; that the priesthood was restored by those who held it anciently.

In reading his bible, he was remarkably struck with the passage in James, 1st chapter, 5th verse, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Believing in the word of God, he retired into a grove, and called upon the Lord to give him wisdom in relation to this matter. While he was thus engaged, he was surrounded by a brilliant light, and two glorious personages presented themselves before him, who exactly resembled each other in features, and who gave him information upon the subjects which had previously agitated his mind. He was given to understand that the churches were all of them in error in regard to many things; and he was commanded not to go after them; and he received a promise that the 'fulness' of the gospel should at some future time be unfolded unto him: after which the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace.\"\n\nJohn Taylor, Letter to the Editor of the Interpreter Anglais et Fran\u00e7ais, Boulogne-sur-mer (25 June 1850).{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> and he may have alluded to it in a discourse given in 1859.<ref>\"What could the Lord do with such a pack of ignorant fools as we were?

Palmer|Grant Palmer]] and other critics claim that there are serious discrepancies between the various accounts, as well as [[anachronisms]] revealed by lack of contemporary corroboration.<ref>A recent skeptical summary of the First Vision stories is [[Grant H. Palmer|Grant Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 235\u201354. Palmer, a retired LDS religious instructor was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|disfellowshipped]] by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after publishing this book. Palmer concludes his chapter, \"The 1832 account describes Joseph's experience most accurately. Smith's 1832 description does not forbid him from joining a church, nor does it mention a revival or persecution. Instead, he became convicted of his sins from reading the scriptures and received forgiveness from the Savior in a personal epiphany. He stated that his call to God's work came in 1823 from an angel, later identified as Moroni. When a crisis developed around the Book of Mormon in 1838, he conflated several events into one. Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement. And so I live with the mystery.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script.html |contribution=Part One (Night One Transcript) |title=The Mormons |author=''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' and ''[[American Experience]]'' |editor=[[Helen Whitney]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title-link=The Mormons (film) }}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Side by Side Comparison of Joseph Smith Vision Accounts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | Summer 1832 History<ref>\"History, circa Summer 1832,\" p. 1, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | November 1835 Journal<ref>\"Journal, 1835\u20131836,\" p. 23, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/24</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1838 History<ref>\"History, circa June 1839\u2013circa 1841 [Draft 2],\" p. 2, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1842 Wentworth Letter<ref>\"\u201cChurch History,\u201d 1 March 1842,\" p. 706, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My mind became exceedingly distressed, for I became convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

Online at: http://signaturebookslibrary.org/inventing-mormonism-01/</ref>  Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\".<ref>{{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}</ref> In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820.<ref>{{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> <ref>For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\n====Dating the Revival====\n[[File:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Typical scene from a Methodist camp meeting]]\n[[Richard Bushman]] wrote that Smith \"began to be concerned about religion in late 1817 or early 1818, when the aftereffects of the revival of 1816 and 1817 were still being felt.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=37}}</ref> [[Milton V.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured [sic] of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened. I am persuaded that it was 1824 when Lucy joined the Presbyterians.\" {{Harv|Hill|1982|p=39}}.</ref> However, this conclusion requires ignoring both Joseph's statement that the first vision occurred during his fifteenth year and Lucy's chronology in the fair copy.

Allen (historian)|James B. Allen]] notes that:\n\n<blockquote> The fact that none of the available contemporary writings about Joseph Smith in the 1830s, none of the publications of the Church in that decade, and no contemporary journal or correspondence yet discovered mentions the story of the first vision is convincing evidence that at best it received only limited circulation in those early days.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1830s reference to early Christian regeneration===\n\nIn June 1830, Smith provided the first clear record of a significant personal religious experience prior to the visit of the [[angel Moroni]].<ref>The account was first published to non-Mormons in 1831. {{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref> At that time, Smith and his associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] were establishing the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the first [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] church.  In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided. Although the reference was later linked to the First Vision,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Allen|1980|p=45}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=39, 112}}.</ref> its original hearers would have understood the manifestation as simply another of many revival experiences in which the subject testified that his sins had been forgiven.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.</ref>\n\n===1832 Smith account===\nThe earliest extant account of the First Vision was handwritten by Smith in 1832 in a letter book, but its existence was not known outside the Church History department until it was published in 1965.<ref>\"One of the most significant documents of that period yet discovered was brought to light in 1965 by [[Paul R. Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S. Church Historian's office for many years, and yet few if any who saw it realized its profound historical significance.\" {{harv|Allen|1966|p=35}}</ref>  Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian's collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].  In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.  In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master's thesis.  The Tanner's obtained a copy of the thesis transcript and the account was published for the first time in 1965.<ref>Stan Larson ''Another Look at Joseph Smith's First Vision'' Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer 2014), pp. 37-62.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

However, [[Stephen Prothero]] argues that any historian should expect to find differences in narratives written many years apart, and that the key elements are present in all the accounts.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon Publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux| year=2003 |page=171}} (\"Any good lawyer (or historian) would expect to find contradictions or competing narratives written down years apart and decades after the event.

In each case, God tells him to remain aloof from all Christian denominations, as something better is in store.\")</ref>\n\nSome believers view differences in the accounts as overstated. [[Richard L. Anderson]] wrote, \"What are the main problems of interpreting so many accounts? The first problem is the interpreter. One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences. Think of how you retell a vivid event in your life\u2014marriage, first day on the job, or an automobile accident. A record of all your comments would include short and long versions, along with many bits and pieces. Only by blending these glimpses can an outsider reconstruct what originally happened. The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation. This means that any First Vision account contains some fraction of the whole experience. Combining all reliable reports will recreate the basics of Joseph Smith's quest and conversation with the Father and Son.\"{{Harv|Anderson|1996}}</ref> Other believers view the differences in the accounts as reflective of Smith's increase in maturity and knowledge over time.<ref>\"I've actually studied the various accounts of Joseph's First Vision, and I'm struck by the difference in his recountings.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination.

Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation and use by the LDS Church===\nAccording to the LDS Church, the vision teaches that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone; that mankind was literally created in the image of God; that Satan is real but God infinitely greater; that God hears and answers prayer; that no other contemporary church had the fullness of Christ's gospel; and that revelation has not ceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the 21st century, the vision features prominently in the Church's program of proselytism.<ref>{{harvnb|Widmer|2000|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAn official website of the LDS Church calls the First Vision \"the greatest event in world history since the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://josephsmith.net/article/the-first-vision |title=The First Vision |date=9 September 2013 |work=JosephSmith.net |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> In 1998, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B.

Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration.

In reading his bible, he was remarkably struck with the passage in James, 1st chapter, 5th verse, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Believing in the word of God, he retired into a grove, and called upon the Lord to give him wisdom in relation to this matter. While he was thus engaged, he was surrounded by a brilliant light, and two glorious personages presented themselves before him, who exactly resembled each other in features, and who gave him information upon the subjects which had previously agitated his mind. He was given to understand that the churches were all of them in error in regard to many things; and he was commanded not to go after them; and he received a promise that the 'fulness' of the gospel should at some future time be unfolded unto him: after which the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace.\"\n\nJohn Taylor, Letter to the Editor of the Interpreter Anglais et Fran\u00e7ais, Boulogne-sur-mer (25 June 1850).{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> and he may have alluded to it in a discourse given in 1859.<ref>\"What could the Lord do with such a pack of ignorant fools as we were?

The summary following the excerpt (10) emphasizes the importance of the Book of Mormon, but makes no additional comment about the First Vision.</ref>\n\n===Church of Christ (Temple Lot)===\nThe [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], a branch with 7000 adherents, rejects many of Smith's post-1832 revelations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/history.html |title=History of the Church of Christ |work=churchofchrist-tl.org |publisher=[[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421070901/http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/history.html |archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref> Nevertheless, the church uses several elements of the 1842 account of the First Vision, including Smith's desire to know which church he should join, his reading of James 1:5, his prayer in the grove, the appearance of God the Father and Jesus Christ, the statement by Jesus that all existing churches were corrupt, and the instruction that Smith should join none of them.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/mormon.html#how |title=Book of Mormon: How did we get it |work=|publisher=Church of Christ (Temple Lot) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182348/http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/mormon.html#how |archivedate=2008-04-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Criticism and response===\nWriting of the \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\" described in the First Vision story canonized by the LDS Church, [[Milton V.

Palmer|Grant Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 235\u201354. Palmer, a retired LDS religious instructor was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|disfellowshipped]] by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after publishing this book. Palmer concludes his chapter, \"The 1832 account describes Joseph's experience most accurately. Smith's 1832 description does not forbid him from joining a church, nor does it mention a revival or persecution. Instead, he became convicted of his sins from reading the scriptures and received forgiveness from the Savior in a personal epiphany. He stated that his call to God's work came in 1823 from an angel, later identified as Moroni. When a crisis developed around the Book of Mormon in 1838, he conflated several events into one. Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement.

I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

In 2010 Dale T. Mortensen, a Niels Bohr Visiting Professor at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his colleagues Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Aarhus University}}The history of the Aarhus BSS is both old and new. On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (ASB or in Danish: ''Handelsh\u00f8jskolen)'' merged with Aarhus University to become part of Aarhus University and in 2011 the Aarhus School of Business and Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business  was founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences, consisting of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969.\n\nAarhus School of Business's predecessor, The Jutland Business School (Den Jyske Handelsh\u00f8jskole, DJH), has a somewhat more extensive history. Already in the late 1800s, DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to follow studies within business, economics and trade. Only when Aarhus School of Business was founded in 1939 did it become the academic institution that it was known as today.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402235749/http://bss.au.dk/profile/historie/history-of-aarhus-school-of-business/]\n\nAarhus School of Business has continually grown since its founding.

On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (ASB or in Danish: ''Handelsh\u00f8jskolen)'' merged with Aarhus University to become part of Aarhus University and in 2011 the Aarhus School of Business and Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business  was founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences, consisting of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969.\n\nAarhus School of Business's predecessor, The Jutland Business School (Den Jyske Handelsh\u00f8jskole, DJH), has a somewhat more extensive history. Already in the late 1800s, DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to follow studies within business, economics and trade. Only when Aarhus School of Business was founded in 1939 did it become the academic institution that it was known as today.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402235749/http://bss.au.dk/profile/historie/history-of-aarhus-school-of-business/]\n\nAarhus School of Business has continually grown since its founding. In 1968 Aarhus School of Business moved from the original location downtown Aarhus to the yellow and red brick buildings which since then have provided the setting for the outstanding research and teaching that Aarhus School of Business stood for.\n\nAfter the 2011 merger the school now has around 16,000 students, 737 academic staff, including 223 PhD students,<sup>[3]</sup> making it one of the largest business schools in Europe.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Student life at BSS.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Student life.]] -->\n\n==Campus and student life==\n[[File:Aarhus Business School.jpg|thumb|Students at work on Arhus BSS main campus.]]\nThe campus of the School of Business and Social Sciences has its main base around the University Park, the Nobel Park and campus Fuglesangs All\u00e9, all located in the centre of Aarhus.

After claiming, via telephone, that they had a finished song, Boyce and Hart improvised \"Valleri\" on their way to Kirshner's office. Kirshner was pleased with their work, and \"Valleri\" took its place on the Monkees recording schedule, with Boyce and Hart producing the original sessions in August 1966.\n\nThe original recording (with instrumental backing by the [[Candy Store Prophets]], plus Wrecking Crew [[session musician]] [[Louie Shelton]] contributing a [[flamenco]]esque guitar solo, consisting of [[hammer-on]]s & [[pull-off]]s, a style not heard again in popular rock music until the late 70s) was featured in the show's first season in 1967; a staged performance showed [[Michael Nesmith]] apparently picking Shelton's guitar solo via cuts between Nesmith with his hands obscured and close-ups of hands playing the solo. While the first version of \"Valleri\" went unreleased, a few off-air recordings received radio [[airplay (song)|airplay]] (thanks to [[DJ]]s taping the audio directly from the video), and later surfaced on [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] recordings.\n\nAlmost a year later, at the end of 1967, the song was rerecorded.  According to [[Bobby Hart (songwriter)|Bobby Hart]], the original 1966 track could not be used because the Musicians Union contracts had already been filed with Boyce and Hart listed as producers.  [[The Monkees]], by late 1967, had renegotiated their contracts that included a clause that stated all future recordings would show \"Produced by [[The Monkees]]\" on the label, which meant the song had to be recorded again.  Boyce and Hart were approached about coming back to produce a new track.  [[Bobby Hart (songwriter)|Bobby Hart]] continues, \"[[Lester Sill]]  (the President of [[Colgems]] Records) came back to us and said, 'They want you to recut Valleri. You can't have producers credit, but we want you to go back in and do it again, making it sound as close to the original as possible.'\"  The recording was produced by Boyce and Hart on December 26, 1967.\n\nWhen Lester Sill heard the track, he felt it needed something extra, and had a [[brass instruments|brass]] section overdubbed on December 28.  The remade \"Valleri\" was released on February 17, 1968.  In the [[United States]], the song reached Number Three on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], and Number One in ''[[Cash Box]]''.  It would be the band's last US top ten hit. (It was also their last single to receive a push from their television series and also the last single to be certified gold. The followup single, \"[[D. W. Washburn]]\", was not featured on the show, and only reached #19 in the pop charts. Later singles fared even worse.)\n\n==Other appearances==\n\nThe original recording of \"Valleri\" was finally released in January 1990, as part of the [[Rhino Records]] collection ''[[Missing Links, Volume II]]'', along with several other versions of Monkees tunes used in the TV series.\n\nOf note, 1960s single and LP releases of the second version, as well as subsequent hits packages of the song, feature a fade out ending. The cold ending version (heard in one episode of the television series) was first released on Arista's \"Then And Now, The Best Of The Monkees\" in 1986. Subsequent hits packages and reissues of the single on their Flashback label also feature the longer version. Early examples of the Flashback single release have the fade out ending.\n\n==Live history==\nWhen Davy Jones, [[Micky Dolenz]] and [[Peter Tork]] reunited in 1986 to tour as The Monkees, they featured \"Valleri\" frequently in their song lineup. The song mainly consists of four [[chord (music)|chords]] (F{{music|sharp}} Major, E Major, B Major and C{{music|sharp}} Major); a bridge offers a touch of harmonic variety (from F{{music|sharp}} Major to D{{music|sharp}} minor, twice).\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1968)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[ARIA Charts|Australia]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Austria \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Germany \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Ireland \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|Japan \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Dutch Top 40|Netherlands]] \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Norway \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=601#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand - search listener |website=Flavourofnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-10-02}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio|Springbok]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(M).html |title= South African Rock Lists Website SA Charts 1969 \u2013 1989 Acts (M) |publisher= Rock.co.za |accessdate= 8 September 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[UK Singles Chart|UK]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Hot 100]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''[[Cash Box]]'' Top 100 <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1968)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada <ref>http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.5867&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=mhe12pta2k83e08udtq66ot062</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|89\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'') <ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Monkees Tale'', Eric Lefcowitz (Last Gasp Press) ({{ISBN|0-86719-338-7}})\n* ''Monkeemania!
