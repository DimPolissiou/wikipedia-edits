The best-known section of the suite, the ''[[Berceuse]]'', has been arranged for several combinations of instruments. In the [[United Kingdom]] it became famous as the play-out tune to the BBC radio programme ''[[Listen with Mother]]''.\n\nThe suite, consisting of six short pieces, each with its own title: ''Berceuse'', ''Mi-a-ou'', ''Le jardin de Dolly'', ''Kitty-[[waltz (music)|valse]]'', ''Tendresse'', and ''Le pas espagnol''. The complete suite takes about fifteen minutes to perform.\n\n==Analysis==\n{{Listen|filename=Berceuse by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 op56 no1.ogg|title=Berceuse from Dolly|description=The [[Berceuse]] from Dolly by [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]].|pos=right}}\n\nFaur\u00e9 wrote or revised the pieces between 1893 and 1896,<ref name=n61>Nectoux, p. 61</ref> for R\u00e9gina-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bardac (1892\u20131985), known to her family as Dolly (she was later to become Madame Gaston de Tinan),the young daughter of the singer [[Emma Bardac]], with whom Faur\u00e9 had a long-running affair.<ref name=n36>Nectoux, p. 36</ref> He was in the practice of sending pieces of music, in manuscript, to mark Dolly's birthdays and other family occasions.<ref name=a1/>\n\nIn a marked departure from his customary practice, Faur\u00e9 gave each of the six movements a descriptive, sometimes whimsical, title. Ordinarily he disliked fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as \"barcarolle\" unless his publishers insisted upon them.

The ''Berceuse'', marking Dolly's first birthday, was a very early piece, composed in 1864 for Suzanne Garnier, the daughter of a family friend. In 1893 Faur\u00e9 made some small amendments and changed its title from \"La Chanson dans le jardin\" to \"Berceuse\" \u2013 that is, a cradle song.<ref name=n62>Nectoux, p. 62</ref>\n\n;Mi-a-ou\n''Allegro vivo.'' \"Mi-a-ou\" was written for Dolly's second birthday in June 1894.<ref name=n62/> The title does not refer to a pet cat, as has often been supposed,<ref name=n62/>  but to Dolly's attempts to pronounce the name of her elder brother Raoul, who later became one of Faur\u00e9's favourite pupils.<ref name=n36/> The young Dolly called her brother ''Messieu Aoul'', which Faur\u00e9 took as the original title for the piece.<ref name=n62/> In his finished manuscript the title is shortened to \"Miaou\" (without hyphens).<ref name=p82/> The Faur\u00e9 scholar [[Robert Orledge]] writes that the title \"Mi-a-ou\", like that of the \"Kitty-valse\" later in the suite, is the responsibility of Faur\u00e9's publisher, [[Julien Hamelle]].<ref>Orledge, {{p.|95}}</ref>\n\n;Le jardin de Dolly\n''Andantino''. The third section of the suite, \"Le jardin de Dolly\", was composed as a present for New Year's Day 1895.

The program, which shares its title with a more traditionally formatted morning program that aired on the network from 1987 to 1999, airs Monday through Saturday. It airs live from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone]].  On weekdays, it airs on [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone]]s; stations in the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]] and [[Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii Time Zone]]s (as well as Arizona from mid-March to early November) receive an updated feed with a specialized opening and updated live reports. Stations outside the Eastern Time Zone carry the Saturday broadcast at varied times. It is the tenth distinct morning news-features program format that CBS has aired since 1954, having replaced ''[[The Early Show]]'' on January 9, 2012.\n\nThe program emphasizes general national and international news stories and in-depth reports throughout each edition, although it also includes live in-studio and pre-taped interviews. The format was chosen as an alternative to the [[soft news]] and lifestyle-driven formats of competitors ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'' following the first hour or half-hour of those broadcasts, in an attempt to give the program a competitive edge with its [[hard news]] format. (With the exception of CBS News Sunday Morning, CBS has historically placed a distant third in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] among the network morning shows.)\n\n==History==\n\n===''CBS This Morning'' (first incarnation) and ''The Early Show''===\nThe original incarnation of ''CBS This Morning'' made its debut on November 30, 1987, with hosts [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], former ''[[Good Morning America]]'' news anchor [[Kathleen Sullivan (journalist)|Kathleen Sullivan]], and [[Mark McEwen]], a holdover from the show's infotainment-intensive predecessor ''[[The Early Show#The Morning Program|The Morning Program]]'' as weather caster and announcer. Sullivan was replaced by [[Paula Zahn]] on February 26, 1990. Beginning on October 26, 1992, in an effort to stop [[network affiliate|affiliates]] from dropping the program, CBS increased the amount of time available during the broadcast for local stations, most of which air their own early morning newscasts before the national news program. Despite a far more successful team in Smith, Zahn and McEwen, ''CBS This Morning'' continued to languish in third place. It was, however, far more competitive than any of its predecessors. A new set and live format introduced in October 1995 had little effect on the ratings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSmith and Zahn left the program on June 14, 1996, with [[CBS News]] correspondents [[Harold Dow]] and [[Erin Moriarty]] anchoring ''CBS This Morning'' for seven weeks until a new format was in place. In August 1996, the program was revamped again, as simply ''This Morning'', with McEwen and [[Jane Robelot]] as co-hosts, news anchor [[Jose Diaz-Balart]] (succeeded by Cynthia Bowers, then [[Thalia Assuras]], and finally [[Julie Chen]]) and [[Craig Allen (meteorologist)|Craig Allen]] (of [[WCBS-TV]] and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS-AM]] in [[New York City]]) serving as weather anchor.\n\nA new format was created where local stations could opt to air their own newscast from 7 to 8 a.m. local time, interspersed with inserts from the national broadcast; the second hour of the national broadcast would then air uninterrupted from 8 to 9 a.m. Ratings went up slightly, and at one point in 1998 the program even moved ahead of ''Good Morning America''. But its ratings success was also brief, and CBS announced its decision to cancel the program in early 1999. Robelot left ''This Morning'' in June 1999 after it was revealed that the program would be replaced. Assuras served as co-anchor and Chen as newsreader for the show's remaining five months. McEwen left the show at the end of September 1999 to prepare for the launch of ''The Early Show'' and was replaced by [[Russ Mitchell]], who formerly conducted sports segments.\n\n''This Morning'' ended on October 29, 1999 after twelve years. It was replaced by ''[[The Early Show]]'', which debuted the following Monday, November 1. Though it had occasional peaks in the [[The Early Show#Ratings|ratings]], ''The Early Show'' was a perennial third-place finisher behind [[NBC]]'s ''Today'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Good Morning America''. In its last year, ''The Early Show'' shied away from the news, features, light stories and \"[[infotainment]]\" approach used by the program since its debut, that it based off the formats of its two main competitors.\n\n===Development and revival===\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in an Interview With Gayle King of CBS (48584861642).jpg|thumb|[[Gayle King]] interviews Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] in 2019]]\nOn November 15, 2011, CBS News announced that ''The Early Show'' would be cancelled, and that the news division would overhaul its morning news program effective January 9, 2012.

Most frequently, meteorologists from one of CBS's [[owned-and-operated station]]s - such as Danielle Niles of [[Boston]] O&O [[WBZ-TV]], [[Megan Glaros]] of [[Chicago]] O&O [[WBBM-TV]] and [[Lonnie Quinn]] (former meteorologist for the program's Saturday edition) of [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] New York City O&O [[WCBS-TV]] - appear weekdays (as needed), and Ed Curran of [[Chicago]] O&O [[WBBM-TV]] works the Saturday edition (when necessary).\n\n===Local news cutaways===\n\nFor stations that do not make use of the local news cutaways at :26 and :56 past the hour (including CBS affiliates that do not have a news department), the program uses a taped story introduced by that day's ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' anchor during that time; previously it contained a [[happy talk]] segment between the anchors and panelists.

It airs live from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, although local air times for the Saturday broadcast vary significantly from station to station, even within the same time zone; in some markets, the local CBS affiliate may opt to pre-empt ''CBS This Morning Saturday'' \u2013 usually to carry extended weekend morning local newscasts \u2013 and may instead air it on a [[digital subchannel]], a [[sister station]] (such as the case with [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WNDY-TV]] in [[Indianapolis]], which aired it in lieu of co-owned [[WISH-TV]] until that station lost its CBS affiliation in January 2015; [[WWL-TV]] in [[New Orleans]] does the same, moving it to sister station [[WUPL]] to carry their strong local morning newscast) or refuses to air it (such as with [[KENS-TV]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and [[WREG-TV]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]).\n\nMost CBS affiliates in the Central Time Zone carry the Saturday edition live from 6:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time, unlike its morning counterparts, which air their Saturday editions on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]; it is the only morning program that airs live in both the Eastern and Central time zones, whereas the Saturday edition is aired on tape delay in the remaining time zones.\n\nWhen it debuted, the Saturday edition was originally anchored by [[Rebecca Jarvis]] and Jeff Glor, with [[Betty Nguyen]] serving as the program's news anchor and [[Lonnie Quinn]] as weather anchor. After Glor was named anchor of the Sunday edition of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the program started using various male correspondents, including [[Anthony Mason (journalist)|Anthony Mason]], [[Chip Reid]], [[Jim Axelrod]], [[Maurice DuBois]], [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]], [[Byron Pitts]], [[Ben Tracy]], [[Lee Cowan]], [[Seth Doane]] and [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]], rotating every other Saturday. Following a divisional restructuring in May 2019 that resulted in his departure from the ''CBS Evening News'', Glor rejoined ''CBS This Morning Saturday'' on June 22, 2019.\n\nLike the weekend editions of other network morning shows, the program has a greater focus on human-interest pieces than on weekdays, though it still concentrates primarily on the news of the day during the first half-hour. It also retains some of the common features of the morning show genre which were removed from the weekday show, such as musical performances and food segments, and a couch moved temporarily onto the main set where the hosts introduce certain segments; it also did not include some features of the weekday program including the \"EyeOpener\" (which was added at the top of the first hour of the broadcast on June 14, 2014). Formal national weather segments continued to be included until March 2013; [[Lonnie Quinn]] served as the Saturday weather anchor until his unannounced departure in late 2012, with CBS owned-and-operated station meteorologists substituting until formal weather segments were dropped in accordance with the weekday edition of the program.\n\nAn exception to the usual Saturday format occurred on February 2, 2013 (the day before [[Super Bowl XLVII]]), when the weekday anchor team hosted from [[New Orleans]] (where the game was held at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]]), an edition that was branded as simply ''CBS This Morning'' (instead of ''CBS This Morning Saturday'') and was formatted similarly to the weekday program, including \"EyeOpener\" segments at the top of both hours.\n\n''CBS This Morning'' does not produce a Sunday edition as a result of the long-running ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', a newsmagazine that debuted in 1979 (and is a remnant of a [[The Early Show#The Morning era|short-lived reformatting]] of the original ''CBS Morning News'' broadcast that lasted until 1982). In contrast to ''CBS This Morning'', ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' has long led the ratings among the Sunday morning shows.\n\n===Anchors===\n* [[Michelle Miller]] (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Dana Jacobson]] (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Jeff Glor]] (2012; 2019\u2014present)\n\n===Former on-air staff===\n* [[Rebecca Jarvis]] \u2013 anchor (2012\u20132013) (now at [[ABC News]])\n* [[Betty Nguyen]] \u2013 news anchor (2012) (now at [[WPIX]] in New York City)\n* [[Lonnie Quinn]] \u2013 weather anchor (2012) (now at [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City)\n* [[Anthony Mason (journalist)|Anthony Mason]] (2012\u20132019)<ref>https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cbs-face-the-nation-to-go-one-hour-permanently-mason-joins-jarvis-on-cbs-this-morning/140557/</ref>\n* [[Vinita Nair]] (2013\u20132016)\n* [[Alex Wagner]] (2016\u20132018) (now co-host of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth|The Circus]]'')\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], in the  [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], a trimmed version (for 70 minutes excluding commercials) of the ''CBS This Morning'' weekday edition currently airs on CBS's sister network (since November 2017) [[Network 10]], along with regional affiliate [[WIN Television]], on Tuesday - Friday mornings from 6:30 am until 8:00 am [[AEST]] .

Until recent March 2020, the program was broadcast weekday mornings from 4:30 - 6:00 am, with the Friday edition usually held over to the following Monday. As a result of Network 10's plans to give local mid morning program ''[[Studio 10]]'' a natural lead in for watching by Australian viewers, the program will now air four days a week, in direct competition to rivals of Network Seven's ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' and Nine's ''[[Today (Australian TV program) |Today]]'' (Australian version), with encores of CBS daytime soap opera dramas ''[[The Bold & The Beautiful]]'' to air for two hours on Monday mornings from 6am.

The program, which shares its title with a more traditionally formatted morning program that aired on the network from 1987 to 1999, airs Monday through Saturday. It airs live from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone]].  On weekdays, it airs on [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone]]s; stations in the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]] and [[Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii Time Zone]]s (as well as Arizona from mid-March to early November) receive an updated feed with a specialized opening and updated live reports. Stations outside the Eastern Time Zone carry the Saturday broadcast at varied times. It is the tenth distinct morning news-features program format that CBS has aired since 1954, having replaced ''[[The Early Show]]'' on January 9, 2012.\n\nThe program emphasizes general national and international news stories and in-depth reports throughout each edition, although it also includes live in-studio and pre-taped interviews. The format was chosen as an alternative to the [[soft news]] and lifestyle-driven formats of competitors ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'' following the first hour or half-hour of those broadcasts, in an attempt to give the program a competitive edge with its [[hard news]] format. (With the exception of CBS News Sunday Morning, CBS has historically placed a distant third in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] among the network morning shows.)\n\n==History==\n\n===''CBS This Morning'' (first incarnation) and ''The Early Show''===\nThe original incarnation of ''CBS This Morning'' made its debut on November 30, 1987, with hosts [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], former ''[[Good Morning America]]'' news anchor [[Kathleen Sullivan (journalist)|Kathleen Sullivan]], and [[Mark McEwen]], a holdover from the show's infotainment-intensive predecessor ''[[The Early Show#The Morning Program|The Morning Program]]'' as weather caster and announcer. Sullivan was replaced by [[Paula Zahn]] on February 26, 1990. Beginning on October 26, 1992, in an effort to stop [[network affiliate|affiliates]] from dropping the program, CBS increased the amount of time available during the broadcast for local stations, most of which air their own early morning newscasts before the national news program. Despite a far more successful team in Smith, Zahn and McEwen, ''CBS This Morning'' continued to languish in third place. It was, however, far more competitive than any of its predecessors. A new set and live format introduced in October 1995 had little effect on the ratings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSmith and Zahn left the program on June 14, 1996, with [[CBS News]] correspondents [[Harold Dow]] and [[Erin Moriarty]] anchoring ''CBS This Morning'' for seven weeks until a new format was in place. In August 1996, the program was revamped again, as simply ''This Morning'', with McEwen and [[Jane Robelot]] as co-hosts, news anchor [[Jose Diaz-Balart]] (succeeded by Cynthia Bowers, then [[Thalia Assuras]], and finally [[Julie Chen]]) and [[Craig Allen (meteorologist)|Craig Allen]] (of [[WCBS-TV]] and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS-AM]] in [[New York City]]) serving as weather anchor.\n\nA new format was created where local stations could opt to air their own newscast from 7 to 8 a.m. local time, interspersed with inserts from the national broadcast; the second hour of the national broadcast would then air uninterrupted from 8 to 9 a.m. Ratings went up slightly, and at one point in 1998 the program even moved ahead of ''Good Morning America''. But its ratings success was also brief, and CBS announced its decision to cancel the program in early 1999. Robelot left ''This Morning'' in June 1999 after it was revealed that the program would be replaced. Assuras served as co-anchor and Chen as newsreader for the show's remaining five months. McEwen left the show at the end of September 1999 to prepare for the launch of ''The Early Show'' and was replaced by [[Russ Mitchell]], who formerly conducted sports segments.\n\n''This Morning'' ended on October 29, 1999 after twelve years. It was replaced by ''[[The Early Show]]'', which debuted the following Monday, November 1. Though it had occasional peaks in the [[The Early Show#Ratings|ratings]], ''The Early Show'' was a perennial third-place finisher behind [[NBC]]'s ''Today'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Good Morning America''. In its last year, ''The Early Show'' shied away from the news, features, light stories and \"[[infotainment]]\" approach used by the program since its debut, that it based off the formats of its two main competitors.\n\n===Development and revival===\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in an Interview With Gayle King of CBS (48584861642).jpg|thumb|[[Gayle King]] interviews Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] in 2019]]\nOn November 15, 2011, CBS News announced that ''The Early Show'' would be cancelled, and that the news division would overhaul its morning news program effective January 9, 2012.

Most frequently, meteorologists from one of CBS's [[owned-and-operated station]]s - such as Danielle Niles of [[Boston]] O&O [[WBZ-TV]], [[Megan Glaros]] of [[Chicago]] O&O [[WBBM-TV]] and [[Lonnie Quinn]] (former meteorologist for the program's Saturday edition) of [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] New York City O&O [[WCBS-TV]] - appear weekdays (as needed), and Ed Curran of [[Chicago]] O&O [[WBBM-TV]] works the Saturday edition (when necessary).\n\n===Local news cutaways===\n\nFor stations that do not make use of the local news cutaways at :26 and :56 past the hour (including CBS affiliates that do not have a news department), the program uses a taped story introduced by that day's ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' anchor during that time; previously it contained a [[happy talk]] segment between the anchors and panelists.

It airs live from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, although local air times for the Saturday broadcast vary significantly from station to station, even within the same time zone; in some markets, the local CBS affiliate may opt to pre-empt ''CBS This Morning Saturday'' \u2013 usually to carry extended weekend morning local newscasts \u2013 and may instead air it on a [[digital subchannel]], a [[sister station]] (such as the case with [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WNDY-TV]] in [[Indianapolis]], which aired it in lieu of co-owned [[WISH-TV]] until that station lost its CBS affiliation in January 2015; [[WWL-TV]] in [[New Orleans]] does the same, moving it to sister station [[WUPL]] to carry their strong local morning newscast) or refuses to air it (such as with [[KENS-TV]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and [[WREG-TV]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]).\n\nMost CBS affiliates in the Central Time Zone carry the Saturday edition live from 6:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time, unlike its morning counterparts, which air their Saturday editions on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]; it is the only morning program that airs live in both the Eastern and Central time zones, whereas the Saturday edition is aired on tape delay in the remaining time zones.\n\nWhen it debuted, the Saturday edition was originally anchored by [[Rebecca Jarvis]] and Jeff Glor, with [[Betty Nguyen]] serving as the program's news anchor and [[Lonnie Quinn]] as weather anchor. After Glor was named anchor of the Sunday edition of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the program started using various male correspondents, including [[Anthony Mason (journalist)|Anthony Mason]], [[Chip Reid]], [[Jim Axelrod]], [[Maurice DuBois]], [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]], [[Byron Pitts]], [[Ben Tracy]], [[Lee Cowan]], [[Seth Doane]] and [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]], rotating every other Saturday. Following a divisional restructuring in May 2019 that resulted in his departure from the ''CBS Evening News'', Glor rejoined ''CBS This Morning Saturday'' on June 22, 2019.\n\nLike the weekend editions of other network morning shows, the program has a greater focus on human-interest pieces than on weekdays, though it still concentrates primarily on the news of the day during the first half-hour. It also retains some of the common features of the morning show genre which were removed from the weekday show, such as musical performances and food segments, and a couch moved temporarily onto the main set where the hosts introduce certain segments; it also did not include some features of the weekday program including the \"EyeOpener\" (which was added at the top of the first hour of the broadcast on June 14, 2014). Formal national weather segments continued to be included until March 2013; [[Lonnie Quinn]] served as the Saturday weather anchor until his unannounced departure in late 2012, with CBS owned-and-operated station meteorologists substituting until formal weather segments were dropped in accordance with the weekday edition of the program.\n\nAn exception to the usual Saturday format occurred on February 2, 2013 (the day before [[Super Bowl XLVII]]), when the weekday anchor team hosted from [[New Orleans]] (where the game was held at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]]), an edition that was branded as simply ''CBS This Morning'' (instead of ''CBS This Morning Saturday'') and was formatted similarly to the weekday program, including \"EyeOpener\" segments at the top of both hours.\n\n''CBS This Morning'' does not produce a Sunday edition as a result of the long-running ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', a newsmagazine that debuted in 1979 (and is a remnant of a [[The Early Show#The Morning era|short-lived reformatting]] of the original ''CBS Morning News'' broadcast that lasted until 1982). In contrast to ''CBS This Morning'', ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' has long led the ratings among the Sunday morning shows.\n\n===Anchors===\n* [[Michelle Miller]] (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Dana Jacobson]] (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Jeff Glor]] (2012; 2019\u2014present)\n\n===Former on-air staff===\n* [[Rebecca Jarvis]] \u2013 anchor (2012\u20132013) (now at [[ABC News]])\n* [[Betty Nguyen]] \u2013 news anchor (2012) (now at [[WPIX]] in New York City)\n* [[Lonnie Quinn]] \u2013 weather anchor (2012) (now at [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City)\n* [[Anthony Mason (journalist)|Anthony Mason]] (2012\u20132019)<ref>https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cbs-face-the-nation-to-go-one-hour-permanently-mason-joins-jarvis-on-cbs-this-morning/140557/</ref>\n* [[Vinita Nair]] (2013\u20132016)\n* [[Alex Wagner]] (2016\u20132018) (now co-host of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth|The Circus]]'')\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], in the  [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], a trimmed version (for 70 minutes excluding commercials) of the ''CBS This Morning'' weekday edition currently airs on CBS's sister network (since November 2017) [[Network 10]], along with regional affiliate [[WIN Television]], on Tuesday - Friday mornings from 6:30 am until 8:00 am [[AEST]] .

Until recent March 2020, the program was broadcast weekday mornings from 4:30 - 6:00 am, with the Friday edition usually held over to the following Monday. As a result of Network 10's plans to give local mid morning program ''[[Studio 10]]'' a natural lead in for watching by Australian viewers, the program will now air four days a week, in direct competition to rivals of Network Seven's ''[[Sunrise (TV program) |Sunrise ]]'' and Nine's ''[[Today (Australian TV program) |Today ]]'' (Australian version), with encores of CBS daytime soap opera dramas ''[[The Bold & The Beautiful |The Bold & The Beautiful]]'' to air for two hours on Monday mornings from 6am.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD EXTENDED DETAILS! -->\nRed, a bird who has been an outcast ever since he was a hatchling due to his temper, lives on Bird Island with other [[flightless bird]]s. When his temper causes a \"[[preterm birth|premature hatching]]\" of another bird's [[egg]], he is sentenced to [[anger management]] class, which is the maximum penalty allowed on the island. Red's classmates Chuck, who is hyperactive and can move at [[hypervelocity]], and Bomb, who can cause explosions with his anger and fear, try to befriend him, but he avoids them.\n\nOne day, a boat docks at the island's shore, damaging Red's house. The birds are greeted by two [[Bad Piggies|green-colored pigs]], the captain King Leonard Mudbeard and his assistant Ross, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship. The pigs introduces the birds to various innovations, including a giant [[slingshot]], but Red becomes suspicious and sneaks into Mudbeard's boat where he finds more pigs hidden below deck, contradicting Mudbeard\u2019s claim that it was just him and Ross. When he returns and shows everyone the additional pigs, the birds refuse to believe that the pigs are up to no good, and Mudbeard claims that he only lied to see if Bird Island was safe for his cousins.\n\nDetermined for help, Red recruits Chuck and Bomb to find Mighty Eagle, the protector of Bird Island and the only bird on the island who can fly, who has not been seen for many years. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Eagle Mountain, only to find that he has not flown for years, and that he is [[Obesity|overweight]], self-absorbed, and leading the life of a [[slacker]]. Red discovers the pigs planting [[dynamite]] around the island, and realizes the pigs are planning to steal the birds' eggs while the other birds are distracted with a party. Red pleads for Mighty Eagle to help him, Chuck, and Bomb, but he refuses. Red admonishes Mighty Eagle before he, Chuck, and Bomb depart. The trio race back to sound a warning to the other birds, but the pigs escape with the eggs and activate the dynamite, destroying the village. The other birds apologize to Red for not believing him and under his leadership, they organize an army and construct a boat from the rubble to follow the pigs to Piggy Island.\n\nThe birds discover the pigs living in a walled city ruled by Mudbeard. Deducing that the eggs are in the castle at the center of the city, the birds [[Angry Birds (video game)#Gameplay|use the slingshot to attack by launching themselves over the walls and into the city's buildings]], destroying them. Red, Chuck, and Bomb infiltrate the castle and discover that the eggs are inside a net; the pigs plan to lower the eggs into a giant pot, cook them, and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives to retrieve Red's group and the eggs, having had a change of heart. One egg falls out of the net and Red battles Mudbeard for it, but learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg. A candle Mudbeard was holding ignites the pigs' reserve of dynamite, and the pot collapses and lands on top of Red, shielding him and the egg from the blast as the dynamite explodes, destroying the city.\n\nRed reunites with the other birds as the egg hatches, revealing three small blue birds. Mighty Eagle approaches Red, Chuck, and Bomb, claiming he merely appeared lazy so they could lose faith in him and find faith in themselves, and takes credit for saving the eggs. Red, now a hero, discovers the other birds have rebuilt his house in the center of the village. Moved, Red allows Chuck and Bomb to move in with him. The pigs are revealed to have survived their home's destruction, with Mudbeard plotting a new plan.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the three blue birds use the slingshot to launch themselves out towards the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Red<ref name=VarietyCast />{{efn|name=ab|First appeared in the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' series.}}\n** Aidan McGraw and Kallan Holley as young Red<ref>{{cite tweet | title = Chuck on Twitter: \"Kallan Holley voice as young Red.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD EXTENDED DETAILS! -->\nRed, a bird who has been an outcast ever since he was a hatchling due to his temper, lives on Bird Island with other [[flightless bird]]s. When his temper causes a \"[[preterm birth|premature hatching]]\" of another bird's [[egg]], he is sentenced to [[anger management]] class, which is the maximum penalty allowed on the island. Red's classmates Chuck, who is hyperactive and can move at [[hypervelocity]], and Bomb, who can cause explosions with his anger and fear, try to befriend him, but he avoids them.\n\nOne day, a boat docks at the island's shore, damaging Red's house. The birds are greeted by two [[Bad Piggies|green-colored pigs]], the captain King Leonard Mudbeard and his assistant Ross, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship. The pigs introduces the birds to various innovations, including a giant [[slingshot]], but Red becomes suspicious and sneaks into Mudbeard's boat where he finds more pigs hidden below deck, contradicting Mudbeard\u2019s claim that it was just him and Ross. When he returns and shows everyone the additional pigs, the birds refuse to believe that the pigs are up to no good, and Mudbeard claims that he only lied to see if Bird Island was safe for his cousins.\n\nDetermined for help, Red recruits Chuck and Bomb to find Mighty Eagle, the protector of Bird Island and the only bird on the island who can fly, who has not been seen for many years. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Eagle Mountain, only to find that he has not flown for years, and that he is [[Obesity|overweight]], self-absorbed, and leading the life of a [[slacker]]. Red discovers the pigs planting [[dynamite]] around the island, and realizes the pigs are planning to steal the birds' eggs while the other birds are distracted with a party. Red pleads for Mighty Eagle to help him, Chuck, and Bomb, but he refuses. Red admonishes Mighty Eagle before he, Chuck, and Bomb depart. The trio race back to sound a warning to the other birds, but the pigs escape with the eggs and activate the dynamite, destroying the village. The other birds apologize to Red for not believing him and under his leadership, they organize an army and construct a boat from the rubble to follow the pigs to Piggy Island.\n\nThe birds discover the pigs living in a walled city ruled by Mudbeard. Deducing that the eggs are in the castle at the center of the city, the birds [[Angry Birds (video game)#Gameplay|use the slingshot to attack by launching themselves over the walls and into the city's buildings]], destroying them. Red, Chuck, and Bomb infiltrate the castle and discover that the eggs are inside a net; the pigs plan to lower the eggs into a giant pot, cook them, and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives to retrieve Red's group and the eggs, having had a change of heart. One egg falls out of the net and Red battles Mudbeard for it, but learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg. A candle Mudbeard was holding ignites the pigs' reserve of dynamite, and the pot collapses and lands on top of Red, shielding him and the egg from the blast as the dynamite explodes, destroying the city.\n\nRed reunites with the other birds as the egg hatches, revealing three small blue birds. Mighty Eagle approaches Red, Chuck, and Bomb, claiming he merely appeared lazy so they could lose faith in him and find faith in themselves, and takes credit for saving the eggs. Red, now a hero, discovers the other birds have rebuilt his house in the center of the village. Moved, Red allows Chuck and Bomb to move in with him. The pigs are revealed to have survived their home's destruction, with Mudbeard plotting a new plan.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the three blue birds use the slingshot to launch themselves out towards the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Red<ref name=VarietyCast />{{efn|name=ab|First appeared in the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' series.}}\n** Aidan McGraw and Kallan Holley as young Red<ref>{{cite tweet | title = Chuck on Twitter: \"Kallan Holley voice as young Red.
