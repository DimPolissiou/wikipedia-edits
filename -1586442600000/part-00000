He completed his secondary education at the [[Kirkwall Grammar School]] in Orkney funded by a county scholarship. He went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1901 and a [[B.Sc.]] in geology and mathematics from the same institution in 1907, during which time he received Exhibition Scholarship. Wallace left for Germany to pursue graduate studies in geology, obtaining an [[M.Sc.]] from the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He returned to Scotland to finish his graduate work, earning his [[Ph.D.]] from Edinburgh in 1912. Later that year, Wallace married Elizabeth Harcus Smith (another Orcadian). She later became the founder and first president of the Faculty Women's Club at the University of Alberta (1933) and at Queen's University (1939). The pair had four children: Ronald, Sheila, Brenda, and Elspeth. The latter would become the last Dean of Women at Queen\u2019s.\n\n===Exploring Manitoba (1912\u20131928)===\nIncreasingly renowned for his vast knowledge of rocks and minerals, Wallace moved to [[Canada]] in 1912 to take a position as the very first head of the Department of Geology and Mineralogy at the [[University of Manitoba]], a position he held for nearly sixteen years (from 1912 to 1928). A charismatic and erudite professor, Wallace was held in high esteem by his students and colleagues. His legacy at the University can be still be seen today. In 1986, construction of the Wallace Building was completed on the University of Manitoba\u2019s Fort Garry Campus. The building, part of what is now the Department of Geological Sciences, contains the traditional classrooms and offices, as well as a seismographic data centre and a small geological museum.\n\nIn the midst of his tenure at the University of Manitoba, Wallace also became the Commissioner of Northern Manitoba at the behest of the provincial government. He traveled the north of the province extensively via foot, dogsled, and canoe, camping out with prospectors and explorers while documenting the extensive natural resources of the Canadian north. His reports on the plentiful mineral resources of Northern Manitoba resulted in the beginnings of government resource projects and the extensive infusion of capital into that region. The Manitoban Government later promoted Wallace to the position of Commissioner of Mines in 1927. He would occupy this post for less than a year, however, as his move to the University of Alberta came in 1928.\n\n===Further West: The Move to Alberta (1928\u20131936)===\nThe [[University of Alberta]] was just beginning to establish itself as an important post-secondary institution when it offered Robert Wallace the presidency in 1928. Wallace was to succeed the university\u2019s first ever president, [[Henry Marshall Tory]], who had left the institution to take a position as the President and CEO of the National Research Laboratories (later called the [[National Research Council of Canada]]). When Wallace arrived, the University was nearing the end of its first period of significant expansion.\n\nWallace\u2019s presidency was less than one year old when the global economy began to collapse into the Great Depression in the fall of 1929. Almost immediately, funding for University programs was in short supply and Wallace was forced to take action. He was to decide between shutting down existing University departments or cutting staff salaries across the board. Needless to say, Wallace chose the latter action, and no departments at the University were closed despite the desperate economic situation. The financial difficulties did, however, slow the expansion of the University. No new buildings were constructed on the Edmonton Campus until after the [[Second World War]].\n\nDespite the massive monetary restrictions placed on him by the Great Depression, Wallace managed not only to maintain the integrity and viability of the institution, but to improve it as well. During his period in office, the School of Nursing became an autonomous department with the ability to grant degrees. (Previous to this development, nursing students studying at Alberta had to travel to Ontario or British Columbia to complete their degrees.) Wallace also helped to establish the Banff School of Fine Arts (now called the [[Banff Centre]]) in 1933.\n\nWallace\u2019s contributions were not limited to the educational sphere. During his time in Alberta, Wallace continued with his passion for field geology and resource prospecting. He helped unearth the vast and profitable [[pitchblende]] deposits in the far north region of the province. Wallace was also among the first geologists to suggest that there may be economic potential in the development of the [[tar sands]] on the outskirts of [[Fort McMurray]].\n\n===The Queen\u2019s Principalship (1936\u20131951)===\nAfter nearly eight years as the President of the University of Alberta, Robert Wallace was offered the Principalship at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen\u2019s University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]] by chancellor James Richardson. Wallace accepted the offer, and was installed as the University\u2019s eleventh Principal on September 1, 1936. He was the first scientist to ever hold the position. (Nine of the previous 10 Principals were ministers, the other was a Classics professor.) He would hold the position until his formal retirement in 1951.\n\nPrior to Wallace\u2019s arrival, growth at Queen\u2019s University had stagnated significantly (as it had with most other institutions during the depression years). Under Wallace, however, Queen\u2019s would undergo an extended period of massive expansion. During his reign, Wallace added a large number of new departments and institutes including a School of Nursing and a School of Fine Arts (just like Alberta), a School of Physical Education and Health, a Board of Graduate Studies, and a [[Queen's University Biological Station|Biological Research Station]] (at [[Opinicon Lake|Lake Opinicon]]). Three new buildings were erected during his tenure, and the Students' Union building was torn down and rebuilt\u2014it had been seriously damaged in a fire in 1947. Wallace also worked hard to improve the quality and quantity of academic staff. Faculty and staff salaries were increased four times during his time as Principal. Wallace also defended so-called \u201cleft wing\u201d professors during the intense anti-communist atmosphere of the cold war, refusing to fire those staff members despite heated calls for their dismissal.\n\nIt was during his tenure at Queen\u2019s that Wallace became highly regarded nationally (and internationally) as an extremely effective and efficient academic administrator. He was one of just three Canadians chosen to represent the country at the [[United Nations]] Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) held in London in November 1945. It was at this conference that the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Educational Organization ([[UNESCO]]) was created. Additionally, Wallace received honorary degrees from twenty different universities.\n\nIn 1951, Wallace formally resigned his position as the Principal of Queen\u2019s. His time at the institution was marked by tremendous growth, in terms of both facilities and enrollment. Under his leadership, Queen\u2019s University had become a premier post-secondary institution, and it is no surprise that his time at Queen\u2019s is looked upon fondly by staff, students, and alumni. To many close friends, he was known as \u201cWallace of Queen\u2019s\u201d. Wallace Hall, a large medieval style meeting hall (that is now part of the John Deutsch University Centre Complex), was named in his honor. The portrait collection of Queen\u2019s Principals and Chancellors can also be found in Wallace Hall.\n\n===The Human Stock: Wallace and Eugenics===\nControversially, Robert Wallace was a prominent and outspoken advocate of [[eugenics]] and selective breeding programs, particularly during his time in Alberta. In an address to the [[Canadian Medical Association]] entitled \u201cThe Quality of the Human Stock\u201d in Calgary in June 1934, Wallace asserted the following:\n\n:\"Science has done very much to raise the quality of the stock in the domesticated animals which man has reared for his service; it has done virtually nothing to raise the quality of the human stock.\"\n\n:\"The time has come to make eugenics not only a scientific philosophy but in very truth a religion.\"\n\n:\"These are steps to a still far distant goal\u2014that of a fitter, healthier, intellectually more capable people to do the world\u2019s work, which through its increasing difficulty calls for better quality of brain and brawn that has yet been given to the task.\"\n\nWallace, along with fellow University of Alberta faculty member [[John MacEachran]], was a frank supporter of Alberta\u2019s eugenic legislation, including the 1928 ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'', which permitted the forcible sterilization of \"undesirables\" in the province. Alberta was one of only two provinces (the other was British Columbia) to pass such legislation. The Act was not repealed until 1972.\n\n===The Arctic Institute of North America (1951\u20131955)===\nFollowing his retirement from Queen\u2019s in 1951, Wallace joined the newly formed [[Arctic Institute of North America]] (AINA), which at that time was housed at [[McGill University]] in Montreal. (In 1976, the institute transferred to the [[University of Calgary]], becoming a full, multi-disciplinary Arctic research institute in 1979.)

He completed his secondary education at the [[Kirkwall Grammar School]] in Orkney funded by a county scholarship. He went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1901 and a [[B.Sc.]] in geology and mathematics from the same institution in 1907, during which time he received Exhibition Scholarship. Wallace left for Germany to pursue graduate studies in geology, obtaining an [[M.Sc.]] from the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He returned to Scotland to finish his graduate work, earning his [[Ph.D.]] from Edinburgh in 1912. Later that year, Wallace married Elizabeth Harcus Smith (another Orcadian). She later became the founder and first president of the Faculty Women's Club at the University of Alberta (1933) and at Queen's University (1939). The pair had four children: Ronald, Sheila, Brenda, and Elspeth. The latter would become the last Dean of Women at Queen\u2019s.\n\n===Exploring Manitoba (1912\u20131928)===\nIncreasingly renowned for his vast knowledge of rocks and minerals, Wallace moved to [[Canada]] in 1912 to take a position as the very first head of the Department of Geology and Mineralogy at the [[University of Manitoba]], a position he held for nearly sixteen years (from 1912 to 1928). A charismatic and erudite professor, Wallace was held in high esteem by his students and colleagues. His legacy at the University can be still be seen today. In 1986, construction of the Wallace Building was completed on the University of Manitoba\u2019s Fort Garry Campus. The building, part of what is now the Department of Geological Sciences, contains the traditional classrooms and offices, as well as a seismographic data centre and a small geological museum.\n\nIn the midst of his tenure at the University of Manitoba, Wallace also became the Commissioner of Northern Manitoba at the behest of the provincial government. He traveled the north of the province extensively via foot, dogsled, and canoe, camping out with prospectors and explorers while documenting the extensive natural resources of the Canadian north. His reports on the plentiful mineral resources of Northern Manitoba resulted in the beginnings of government resource projects and the extensive infusion of capital into that region. The Manitoban Government later promoted Wallace to the position of Commissioner of Mines in 1927. He would occupy this post for less than a year, however, as his move to the University of Alberta came in 1928.\n\n===Further West: The Move to Alberta (1928\u20131936)===\nThe [[University of Alberta]] was just beginning to establish itself as an important post-secondary institution when it offered Robert Wallace the presidency in 1928. Wallace was to succeed the university\u2019s first ever president, [[Henry Marshall Tory]], who had left the institution to take a position as the President and CEO of the National Research Laboratories (later called the [[National Research Council of Canada]]). When Wallace arrived, the University was nearing the end of its first period of significant expansion.\n\nWallace\u2019s presidency was less than one year old when the global economy began to collapse into the Great Depression in the fall of 1929. Almost immediately, funding for University programs was in short supply and Wallace was forced to take action. He was to decide between shutting down existing University departments or cutting staff salaries across the board. Needless to say, Wallace chose the latter action, and no departments at the University were closed despite the desperate economic situation. The financial difficulties did, however, slow the expansion of the University. No new buildings were constructed on the Edmonton Campus until after the [[Second World War]].\n\nDespite the massive monetary restrictions placed on him by the Great Depression, Wallace managed not only to maintain the integrity and viability of the institution, but to improve it as well. During his period in office, the School of Nursing became an autonomous department with the ability to grant degrees. (Previous to this development, nursing students studying at Alberta had to travel to Ontario or British Columbia to complete their degrees.) Wallace also helped to establish the Banff School of Fine Arts (now called the [[Banff Centre]]) in 1933.\n\nWallace\u2019s contributions were not limited to the educational sphere. During his time in Alberta, Wallace continued with his passion for field geology and resource prospecting. He helped unearth the vast and profitable [[pitchblende]] deposits in the far north region of the province. Wallace was also among the first geologists to suggest that there may be economic potential in the development of the [[tar sands]] on the outskirts of [[Fort McMurray]].\n\n===The Queen\u2019s Principalship (1936\u20131951)===\nAfter nearly eight years as the President of the University of Alberta, Robert Wallace was offered the Principalship at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen\u2019s University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]] by chancellor James Richardson. Wallace accepted the offer, and was installed as the University\u2019s eleventh Principal on September 1, 1936. He was the first scientist to ever hold the position. (Nine of the previous 10 Principals were ministers, the other was a Classics professor.) He would hold the position until his formal retirement in 1951.\n\nPrior to Wallace\u2019s arrival, growth at Queen\u2019s University had stagnated significantly (as it had with most other institutions during the depression years). Under Wallace, however, Queen\u2019s would undergo an extended period of massive expansion. During his reign, Wallace added a large number of new departments and institutes including a School of Nursing and a School of Fine Arts (just like Alberta), a School of Physical Education and Health, a Board of Graduate Studies, and a [[Queen's University Biological Station|Biological Research Station]] (at [[Opinicon Lake|Lake Opinicon]]). Three new buildings were erected during his tenure, and the Students' Union building was torn down and rebuilt\u2014it had been seriously damaged in a fire in 1947. Wallace also worked hard to improve the quality and quantity of academic staff. Faculty and staff salaries were increased four times during his time as Principal. Wallace also defended so-called \u201cleft wing\u201d professors during the intense anti-communist atmosphere of the cold war, refusing to fire those staff members despite heated calls for their dismissal.\n\nIt was during his tenure at Queen\u2019s that Wallace became highly regarded nationally (and internationally) as an extremely effective and efficient academic administrator. He was one of just three Canadians chosen to represent the country at the [[United Nations]] Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) held in London in November 1945. It was at this conference that the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Educational Organization ([[UNESCO]]) was created. Additionally, Wallace received honorary degrees from twenty different universities.\n\nIn 1951, Wallace formally resigned his position as the Principal of Queen\u2019s. His time at the institution was marked by tremendous growth, in terms of both facilities and enrollment. Under his leadership, Queen\u2019s University had become a premier post-secondary institution, and it is no surprise that his time at Queen\u2019s is looked upon fondly by staff, students, and alumni. To many close friends, he was known as \u201cWallace of Queen\u2019s\u201d. Wallace Hall, a large medieval style meeting hall (that is now part of the John Deutsch University Centre Complex), was named in his honor. The portrait collection of Queen\u2019s Principals and Chancellors can also be found in Wallace Hall.\n\n===The Human Stock: Wallace and Eugenics===\nControversially, Robert Wallace was a prominent and outspoken advocate of [[eugenics]] and selective breeding programs, particularly during his time in Alberta. In an address to the [[Canadian Medical Association]] entitled \u201cThe Quality of the Human Stock\u201d in Calgary in June 1934, Wallace asserted the following:\n\n:\"Science has done very much to raise the quality of the stock in the domesticated animals which man has reared for his service; it has done virtually nothing to raise the quality of the human stock.\"\n\n:\"The time has come to make eugenics not only a scientific philosophy but in very truth a religion.\"\n\n:\"These are steps to a still far distant goal\u2014that of a fitter, healthier, intellectually more capable people to do the world\u2019s work, which through its increasing difficulty calls for better quality of brain and brawn that has yet been given to the task.\"\n\nWallace, along with fellow University of Alberta faculty member [[John MacEachran]], was a frank supporter of Alberta\u2019s eugenic legislation, including the 1928 ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'', which permitted the forcible sterilization of \"undesirables\" in the province. Alberta was one of only two provinces (the other was British Columbia) to pass such legislation. The Act was not repealed until 1972.\n\n===The Arctic Institute of North America (1951\u20131955)===\nFollowing his retirement from Queen\u2019s in 1951, Wallace joined the newly formed [[Arctic Institute of North America]] (AINA), which at that time was housed at [[McGill University]] in Montreal. (In 1976, the institute transferred to the [[University of Calgary]], becoming a full, multi-disciplinary Arctic research institute in 1979.) Wallace signed on as the institute\u2019s executive director. Having spent many years exploring the vast Northern regions of Manitoba and Alberta, Wallace was ideally suited to the task. Though many were surprised that he would accept such a position in his twilight years, Wallace\u2019s passion for discovery and his love for the northern landscape meant the position was a perfect fit.\n\nWallace's tenure at the Institute ended with his sudden death on January 29, 1955. His death was mourned not only at the AINA, but at Queen\u2019s and Alberta as well. Wallace Hall, in the John Deutsch University Centre at Queen's, is named in his honour. Robert Wallace Drive, a street in [[Kingston, Ontario]], is named in his honour.\n\n==External links ==\n* [http://www.cursiter.com/txt-exe-files/Birth.txt Orcadian Birth Data] (from Orkney Genealogy Online)\n* [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=403580 The Quality of the Human Stock] (from the CMAJ Archives)\n* [http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/History/people/wallace.html Robert Charles Wallace] (Queen's University Biography Page)\n* [https://www.ualberta.ca/ALUMNI/history/peoplep-z/index.htm History Trails - R.C.

When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Allen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: \"This is not an exit\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Brett Easton|last=Ellis|authorlink=Brett Easton Ellis|title=American Psycho|publisher=Vintage|date=1991|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nAs written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of [[yuppie]] greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and [[conspicuous consumption]]. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and [[home cinema|home theater]] sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams. He has a mistress on the side and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as \"Jean, my secretary who is in love with me\" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he \"will probably end up married to someday\".\n\nDespite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well - his friends mock him as the \"boy next door\"; his own lawyer refers to him as a \"bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody\"; and he is often dismissed as \"yuppie trash\" by people outside his social circle.\n\nBateman often expresses doubts regarding his own [[sanity]] and he has periodic attacks of [[psychosis]], during which he [[hallucination|hallucinates]]. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an [[unreliable narrator]]. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan |url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors |work=Movieline |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief\u2014being on the \"verge of tears\"\u2014often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he \"just wants to be loved\". He takes [[psychotropic]]s, like [[Xanax]], to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and \"traditional moral values\" because he thinks it will make him more likable. Like everything else about his public persona, his lip service to tolerance and equality is a front; he is in fact virulently [[racism|racist]], [[classism|classist]], [[misogyny|misogynistic]], and [[homophobia|homophobic]].\n\nBateman compensates for his insecurities through obsessive vanity and [[personal grooming]], with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Alan Flusser]] and [[Valentino SpA|Valentino suits]], [[Oliver Peoples]] glasses and [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Louis Vuitton]] and [[Bottega Veneta]] leather goods) as a means of effecting some \"control\" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily \"understood\" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.\n\nBateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex, and is also a prolific rapist. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers (\"I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane\") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking.\n\n==Outside ''American Psycho''==\nBateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel ''[[Glamorama]]'', with \"strange stains\" on the lapel of his Armani suit.\n\nBateman also appeared in the ''American Psycho 2000'' e-mails ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080702100536/http://www.briankotek.com/psycho/movie/am2000.cfm transcribed here]), which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. ''American Psycho 2000'' served as a sort of \"e-quel\" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.\n\nBateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel ''[[Lunar Park]]'', in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing ''American Psycho'' felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost\u2014Bateman\u2014haunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering.  Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.\n\nIn the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', protagonist [[Dexter Morgan]], himself a serial killer, uses the alias \"Dr. Patrick Bateman\" to acquire [[Etorphine|M-99]] for the use of incapacitating his victims.\n\nThere is a recurring character in the video game ''[[Criminal Case (game)|Criminal Case]]'' named Christian Bateman (a combination of the names [[Christian Bale]] and Patrick Bateman) modeled after the character.\n\n==In film and on stage==\nThough [[Christian Bale]] had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Brad Pitt]]. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the ''American Psycho'' DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. In addition, his managers though the role was \"too violent\" and could potentially hurt his career. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of [[Uma Thurman]], in the 2000 documentary ''This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis''. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/21/bret-easton-ellis-speaks-out-on-the-american-psycho-sequel|title= Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out on the American Psycho Sequel|publisher=ign.com |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nScenes with the character were shot for the 2002 [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Ellis revealed in an interview that director [[Roger Avary]] asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he \"thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea\", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with [[Casper Van Dien]]. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with ''Black Book'', director [[Mary Harron]] said, \"We talked about how [[Martian]]-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching [[Tom Cruise]] on [[David Letterman]], and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Helen|last=Weston |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/mary-harron-reveals-inspiration-behind-patrick-bateman/|title=Christian Bale's inspiration for 'American Psycho': Tom Cruise |work=[[BlackBook]]|publisher=McCarthy LLC|location=New York City|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Doctor Who]]'' star [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24431026 | title=Matt Smith cast in American Psycho musical | publisher=[[BBC News]] | work=bbc.co.uk/news | date=7 October 2013 | accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> played the role in the [[American Psycho (musical)|2013 stage musical version of the novel]], with music and lyrics by [[Duncan Sheik]] and a book by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], at [[London]]'s [[Almeida Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web | first=James | last=Lachno| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10360881/Matt-Smith-swaps-Doctor-Who-for-American-Psycho.html | title=Matt Smith swaps Doctor Who for American Psycho | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher=Telegraph Media Group| location=London, England| date=7 October 2013 | accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> In 2016, [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]] portrayed Bateman in a Broadway production of the musical, which ran from March 21-June 5, 2016.\n\n==Chronology==\n*October 1962: Patrick Bateman is born.<ref>The month can be narrowed down by passages where he briefly muses on what it means to be a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], as well as wondering what he will receive for his birthday in October.

He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1984 and [[Harvard Business School]] two years later, and moved to [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.academia.edu/349102/Examining_the_Personality_of_Patrick_Bateman_of_American_Psycho | title=Examining the Personality of Patrick Bateman of American Psycho | author=Chris Schaffer}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Allen and leaves a message on his lawyer's answering machine confessing to his crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Allen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: \"This is not an exit\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Brett Easton|last=Ellis|authorlink=Brett Easton Ellis|title=American Psycho|publisher=Vintage|date=1991|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nAs written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of [[yuppie]] greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and [[conspicuous consumption]]. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and [[home cinema|home theater]] sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams. He has a mistress on the side and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as \"Jean, my secretary who is in love with me\" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he \"will probably end up married to someday\".\n\nDespite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well - his friends mock him as the \"boy next door\"; his own lawyer refers to him as a \"bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody\"; and he is often dismissed as \"yuppie trash\" by people outside his social circle.\n\nBateman often expresses doubts regarding his own [[sanity]] and he has periodic attacks of [[psychosis]], during which he [[hallucination|hallucinates]]. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an [[unreliable narrator]]. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan |url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors |work=Movieline |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief\u2014being on the \"verge of tears\"\u2014often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he \"just wants to be loved\". He takes [[psychotropic]]s, like [[Xanax]], to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and \"traditional moral values\" because he thinks it will make him more likable. Like everything else about his public persona, his lip service to tolerance and equality is a front; he is in fact virulently [[racism|racist]], [[classism|classist]], [[misogyny|misogynistic]], and [[homophobia|homophobic]].\n\nBateman compensates for his insecurities through obsessive vanity and [[personal grooming]], with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Alan Flusser]] and [[Valentino SpA|Valentino suits]], [[Oliver Peoples]] glasses and [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Louis Vuitton]] and [[Bottega Veneta]] leather goods) as a means of effecting some \"control\" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily \"understood\" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.\n\nBateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex, and is also a prolific rapist. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers (\"I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane\") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking.\n\n==Outside ''American Psycho''==\nBateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel ''[[Glamorama]]'', with \"strange stains\" on the lapel of his Armani suit.\n\nBateman also appeared in the ''American Psycho 2000'' e-mails ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080702100536/http://www.briankotek.com/psycho/movie/am2000.cfm transcribed here]), which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. ''American Psycho 2000'' served as a sort of \"e-quel\" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.\n\nBateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel ''[[Lunar Park]]'', in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing ''American Psycho'' felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost\u2014Bateman\u2014haunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering.  Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.\n\nIn the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', protagonist [[Dexter Morgan]], himself a serial killer, uses the alias \"Dr. Patrick Bateman\" to acquire [[Etorphine|M-99]] for the use of incapacitating his victims.\n\nThere is a recurring character in the video game ''[[Criminal Case (game)|Criminal Case]]'' named Christian Bateman (a combination of the names [[Christian Bale]] and Patrick Bateman) modeled after the character.\n\n==In film and on stage==\nThough [[Christian Bale]] had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Brad Pitt]]. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the ''American Psycho'' DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of [[Uma Thurman]], in the 2000 documentary ''This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis''. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/21/bret-easton-ellis-speaks-out-on-the-american-psycho-sequel|title= Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out on the American Psycho Sequel|publisher=ign.com |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nScenes with the character were shot for the 2002 [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Ellis revealed in an interview that director [[Roger Avary]] asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he \"thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea\", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with [[Casper Van Dien]]. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with ''Black Book'', director [[Mary Harron]] said, \"We talked about how [[Martian]]-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching [[Tom Cruise]] on [[David Letterman]], and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Helen|last=Weston |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/mary-harron-reveals-inspiration-behind-patrick-bateman/|title=Christian Bale's inspiration for 'American Psycho': Tom Cruise |work=[[BlackBook]]|publisher=McCarthy LLC|location=New York City|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Doctor Who]]'' star [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24431026 | title=Matt Smith cast in American Psycho musical | publisher=[[BBC News]] | work=bbc.co.uk/news | date=7 October 2013 | accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> played the role in the [[American Psycho (musical)|2013 stage musical version of the novel]], with music and lyrics by [[Duncan Sheik]] and a book by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], at [[London]]'s [[Almeida Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web | first=James | last=Lachno| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10360881/Matt-Smith-swaps-Doctor-Who-for-American-Psycho.html | title=Matt Smith swaps Doctor Who for American Psycho | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher=Telegraph Media Group| location=London, England| date=7 October 2013 | accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> In 2016, [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]] portrayed Bateman in a Broadway production of the musical, which ran from March 21-June 5, 2016.\n\n==Chronology==\n*October 1962: Patrick Bateman is born.<ref>The month can be narrowed down by passages where he briefly muses on what it means to be a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], as well as wondering what he will receive for his birthday in October.

He has started his own brokerage firm and seems to be wealthier than he was in the original novel. His tastes are even more refined. His homicidal tendencies (or thoughts) seem to have cooled a little with the birth of his son and have mellowed as he has gotten older, but have not disappeared completely.\n*2003: Ellis kills off Patrick Bateman by writing an account of the serial killer being trapped in a pier fire.
