A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].

Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way;

it was resolved quickly in D.C. but took significantly longer for those situated in Cairo.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> However, both teams could eventually return with the photographs they had taken and development was able to continue.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> At the same time, Rockstar Games and the Houser brothers kept requesting changes so frequently that the studio was not able to keep up, leading to overwork and more crunch.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Around this time, three people connected to the studio (one active employee and two former employees) died.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This combined also made for a toxic studio culture.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> After a year of work, Gigliotti left the studio and formed the studio Concrete Games in conjunction with publisher [[THQ]], followed by eleven of ''Agent''{{'s}} leads also leaving Rockstar San Diego to join Gigliotti's new studio on the next day.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> To compensate for these departures, ''Red Dead Revolver'' developers were put in charge for ''Agent'' after ''Red Dead Revolver'' was released.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Under the new leadership, the studio spent another year upgrading its internal [[game engine]] for use within ''Agent''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Shortly thereafter, the game was put on hold indefinitely.<ref name=\"VG247: Agent listed\" />\n\nAfter Criterion Games was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2004, Rockstar San Diego established [[RAGE Technology Group]]: an in-studio team to develop the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), its proprietary game engine.<ref name=\"GameStar: RAGE\" /> The engine was introduced in ''[[Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis]]'', also developed by Rockstar San Diego and released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Kotaku: That Time\" /> RAGE remains under development and is used in most of Rockstar Games' personal computer and [[Video game console|console]] titles, including ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Digital Spy: Table Tennis\" /><ref name=\"Eurogamer: RAGE\" /> Diego Angel left Rockstar San Diego in 2005 to return to his hometown in Colombia.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Alan Wasserman, who had joined Rockstar San Diego in 2003, replaced Angel and became the studio's [[general manager]].<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Angel in Disguise\" /> By January 2006, the studio began searching for new talent to produce next-generation games.<ref name=\"IGN: Prepares for Next-Gen\" />\n\n=== Controversy, ''Red Dead Redemption'', and layoffs (2006\u20132011) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Dead Redemption.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Many critics claim ''Red Dead Redemption'' (cover pictured) to be, Rockstar San Diego's greatest work so far, and one of Rocksar Games' best releases ever.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Rockstar conquers\" />]] -->\nTerri-Kim Chuckry and Garrett Flynn, former Rockstar San Diego [[Video game artist|3D artists]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit on behalf of themselves and over one hundred other ex-employees against the company on August 26, 2006, claiming unpaid overtime compensation.<ref name=\"Engadget: Lawsuit\" /> The case, ''Garrett Flynn, et al. v.

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way;

this led him to approach the video game business.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Limber cited Angel's business model as the biggest factor in the company's survival of the [[dot-com bubble]], which severely impacted the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego-area]] multimedia industry.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Around this time, Angel Studios accepted game designer [[Ed Annunziata]]'s pitch to create [[cutscene]]s for the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]''.<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> Annunziata was pleased with the result and invited Angel Studios to work on cutscenes for his next game, ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'', for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> ''Mr. Bones'' was released in 1996, with Angel Studios contributing the cutscenes and additional artwork.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" />\n\n{{Quote box |text=I was the only company in video games, the only [American] studio in those days, that was working and getting along with the Japanese.

Capcom's [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original [[intellectual property]] entitled ''S.W.A.T.''.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> It later adopted a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \"Spaghetti Western Action Team\".<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead Interview\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Capcom Unveils\" /> Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> ''Red Dead Revolver'' missed the 2002 [[European Computer Trade Show]] and 2003 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name=\"IGN: Capcom TGS\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: status update\" /> Okamoto then left Capcom,<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> which stopped funding the game in July 2003 and announced in August of that year that the game was canceled.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom no longer\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom cancels\" /> Rockstar Games acquired the rights to ''Red Dead Revolver'' in December, and resumed its development.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Rockstar rescues\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Announces\" /> The game's \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch time]]\" increased for as rapid a release as possible, and it was released in May 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />\n\nRockstar San Diego began developing ''Agent'', an open-world [[stealth game]] for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, in 2003.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /><ref name=\"VG247: Another E3\" /> The development team leadership was mostly as the same as that of Rockstar San Diego's 2001 game ''[[Transworld Surf]]'', headed up by [[Video game producer|producer]] Luis Gigliotti.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> In favor of developing ''Agent'', the team ceased work on an untitled [[Justice League]] game that was still being conceptualized.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Unlike prior Angel Studios games, ''Agent'' began a prototype stage with a full-size team.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This team was given little time to complete this prototype, leading to much \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch]]\" at the studio.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Rockstar Games also removed studio-wide vacations after successfully reaching milestones or launching a game, a change many employees felt was abrupt.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Some Rockstar San Diego artists traveled to [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], two locations ''Agent'' was to be set in.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> The four artists that traveled to Cairo took \"over 10,000\" of such photographs.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Talking To The PS4\" /> In both cases, artists were detained by the local police forces;

The second season of the reality series debuted on August 12, 2014 and ended on November 4, 2014, after airing thirteen episodes. Both seasons featured a \"Reunion\" episode that reunited all the crew members to discuss the events of the season, as well as a special episode \"The Crew Tells All\" with unseen footage of the season. The third season premiered on August 25, 2015 and concluded on December 1, 2015 with a two-part \"Reunion\" episode. Season four premiered on September 6, 2016 and concluded on December 6, 2016. The fifth season premiered on September 5, 2017 and concluded on December 5, 2017 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on December 12, 2017. Season six premiered on October 2, 2018 and concluded on January 29, 2019 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on February 5, 2019.\n\nBoth Below Deck and Below Deck Med appeared on E! Network in Canada for the first five (I - V) seasons.  For the first five seasons, E! Network Canada would often air the seasons in the same time slot as in the US, however not all seasons followed the Bravo! U.S.A. schedule.  Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Below Deck\n| image = Below Deck logo.png\n| genre = [[Reality television]]\n| country = United Status\n| language = English\n| num_seasons = 7\n| num_episodes = 105 <!--as of February 17, 2020-->\n| list_episodes = List of Below Deck episodes\n| executive_producer = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Cronin\n* Courtland Cox\n* {{nowrap|Nadine Rajabi <small>(season 3\u2013)</small>}}\n* Lauren Simms \n* Rebecca Henning <br /><small>(co-executive, season 3\u2013)</small>\n* James Bruce<br /> <small>(co-executive, season 1)</small>\n* Elise Duran <small>(season 2)</small>}}\n| runtime = 42 minutes\n| company = [[51 Minds Entertainment]]\n| channel = [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]\n| picture_format = {{plainlist|\n* [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n* [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])}}\n| first_aired = {{Start date|2013|7|1}}\n| last_aired = present\n| related = {{plainlist|\n* ''[[Below Deck Mediterranean]]''\n* ''Below Deck Sailing Yacht''}}\n| website = http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck\n}}\n\n'''''Below Deck''''' is an American [[reality television]] series on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] that debuted on July 1, 2013, created by Rebecca Taylor Henning & Doug Henning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title=Bravo Media Sets Sail With New Docu-Series 'Below Deck' Premiering Monday Junly 1|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/08/bravo-media-sets-sail-with-new-docu-series-below-deck-premiering-monday-junly-1/181578/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hertzfeld|first=Laura|title='Below Deck': Check out the mega yacht that's home to new Bravo series -- VIDEO EXCLUSIVE|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/08/below-deck-bravo/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Announced in April 2012, ''Below Deck'' chronicles the lives of the crew members who work and reside aboard a [[mega-yacht]] during [[Yacht charter|charter]] season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=Bravo Greenlights 11 New and 8 Returning Unscripted Series and Plans First Scripted Premiere for 2013|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/04/bravo-greenlights-11-new-and-8-returning-unscripted-series-and-plans-first-scripted-premiere-for-2013/127574/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> It shows the crew as they deal with their personal issues in order to make their professional careers work.

Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "name_user": "Broadwaygenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast:Courtney third stew/2nd stew", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_Deck"}

Opposing the proposal were [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Dominica]], and [[Nicaragua]] (all of which entered the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]] in response), and [[Mercosur]] member states.\nDiscussions have faltered over similar points as the [[Doha Development Round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) talks; developed nations sought expanded trade in [[Service Sector|services]] and increased [[intellectual property]] rights, while less developed nations sought an end to [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil took a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States took a similar role for the developed nations.\n\n===Origins===\nFree Trade Area of the Americas began with the [[Summit of the Americas]] in Miami, Florida, on December 11, 1994, but the FTAA came to public attention during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]], held in Canada in 2001, a meeting targeted by massive [[anti-corporatization]] and [[anti-globalization]] protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though not as large.\n\n===Disagreements===\nIn previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] style copyright protections similar to the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]]. Another protection would likely have restricted the importation or cross importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil posed a three-track approach that called for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on [[rules of origin]], and a dispute resolution process Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTA, leaving them to the WTO.\n\nThe location of the FTA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities were: [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and [[Miami]] in the United States; [[Canc\u00fan]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] in Mexico; [[Panama City]], Panama; and [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The U.S. city of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftaa-alca.org/tnc/candidate_e.asp |title=ALCA - FTA - ZLEA - Candidate Cities for the Permanent Site of the FTAA Secretariat |publisher=Ftaa-alca.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively an interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.\n\nThe last summit was held at [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTA was reached. Of the 39 countries present at the negotiations, 20 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTA agenda augured poorly.\n\n===Current status===\n{{update|date=July 2016}}\nThe FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005]].<ref>[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article?id=161362709 ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals.

Opposing the proposal were [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Dominica]], and [[Nicaragua]] (all of which entered the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]] in response), and [[Mercosur]] member states.\nDiscussions have faltered over similar points as the [[Doha Development Round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) talks; developed nations sought expanded trade in [[Service Sector|services]] and increased [[intellectual property]] rights, while less developed nations sought an end to [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil took a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States took a similar role for the developed nations.\n\n===Origins===\nFree Trade Area of the Americas began with the [[Summit of the Americas]] in Miami, Florida, on December 11, 1994, but the FTAA came to public attention during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]], held in Canada in 2001, a meeting targeted by massive [[anti-corporatization]] and [[anti-globalization]] protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though not as large.\n\n===Disagreements===\nIn previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] style copyright protections similar to the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]]. Another protection would likely have restricted the importation or cross importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil posed a three-track approach that called for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on [[rules of origin]], and a dispute resolution process Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTA, leaving them to the WTO.\n\nThe location of the FTA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities were: [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and [[Miami]] in the United States; [[Canc\u00fan]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] in Mexico; [[Panama City]], Panama; and [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The U.S. city of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftaa-alca.org/tnc/candidate_e.asp |title=ALCA - FTA - ZLEA - Candidate Cities for the Permanent Site of the FTAA Secretariat |publisher=Ftaa-alca.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively an interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.\n\nThe last summit was held at [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTA was reached. Of the 39 countries present at the negotiations, 20 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTA agenda augured poorly.\n\n===Current status===\n{{update|date=July 2016}}\nThe FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005]].<ref>[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article?id=161362709 ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals.

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].
