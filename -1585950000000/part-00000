Mao endorsed the revolutionary discourse and the attacks on authority figures, who he believed had grown complacent, bureaucratic, and anti-revolutionary. Local Red Guards attacked anyone who they believed lacked revolutionary credentials, and then eventually turned on those who simply failed to wholeheartedly support their efforts and intentions. In August 1966, the Central Committee issued a directive entitled the \u201cDecision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\u201d (a.k.a. the Sixteen Points) in an effort to define the revolution\u2019s goals. Later that month, Mao began to greet huge parades of [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] holding aloft his [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Introduction to the Cultural Revolution|last = Spence|first = Jonathan|publisher = Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute For International Studies|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Stanford University|pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe movement grew but also splintered into independent movements and Red Guard factions, each with its own vision of the movement.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, 1966-1976|url = http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cultrev.htm|website = www.sjsu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}</ref> Despite official directives and encouragement from the Party leadership, local forces were left to act according to their own definitions of the Revolution's goals, and many of them ended up inflicting violence upon their communities and clashing with each other. Nobody wanted to be considered a \u201creactionary,\u201d but in the absence of official guidelines for identifying \u201ctrue Communists,\u201d almost everyone became a target of abuse. People tried to protect themselves and escape persecution by attacking friends and even their own families. The result was a bewildering series of attacks and counterattacks, factional fighting, unpredictable violence, and the breakdown of authority throughout China.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The build-up to massacre ===\nBy the time of the massacre, Dao County had not yet established its own local [[Revolutionary committee (China)|revolutionary committee]] to deal with \"[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]\". Thus, local army officers were the administrators of the county\u2019s leading group for \u201cgrasping revolution and promoting production\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = The Dao County Massacre of 1967|url = http://www.massviolence.org/The-Dao-County-Massacre-of-1967?artpage=1-7|website = www.massviolence.org|date = 2009-03-25|accessdate = 2015-11-15|first = Online Encyclopedia of Mass|last = Violence}}</ref>\n\nAt two countywide meetings on August 5 and August 11, Liu Shibing, the Political Commissar of the county's militia headquarters, spread a conspiracy rumor: [[Chiang Kai-shek]]\u2019s [[Kuomintang|Nationalist troops]] were going to attack mainland China, and the county\u2019s class enemies, particularly the [[Five Black Categories]], planned to rise in rebellion in cooperation with Chiang\u2019s war plan. In addition, Liu claimed that a number of people under the Five Black Categories\" in Dao County \"had plotted to kill all Communist party members and poor- and lower-middle peasant leaders in the county.\" Liu Shibing, along with Xiong Binen, Deputy-Secretariat of the Dao County CPC Committee, ordered all levels of militia personnel and security officers to start an urgent preemptive attack against the class enemies. Although they did not specifically state the word \u201ckill\u201d, all levels of party leadership understood the meaning of this strong signal. There is no doubt that those government officials at the highest county rank were the decision-makers. They not only manufactured an imminent threat to justify the approaching massacre but instructed their subordinates to execute the killing as well.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Massacre ==\n\n=== Target population ===\nAlmost everyone could be a target during the massacre. Victims ranged in age from a ten-day-old infant to a 78-year-old grandfather. Those killed or driven to suicide not only included people deemed \"[[Five Black Categories]]\", but sometimes were killed due to personal resentment and a history of conflicts from local authorities and residents, who often abused their power to settle personal disputes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe district and commune level instigators created their own brutal and lawless way of organizing the massacres in their areas. Prior to the executions they would often hold a short \u201ctrial\u201d (lasting only a few minutes) in the lawlessly created \u201cSupreme Court of the Poor and Lower-middle Peasants\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The \u201cjudges\u201d were unsurprisingly the local leaders who prearranged the killings. If the victims were sentenced to death (and they almost always were amid the corruption and lawlessness), they were trussed up by armed militia and taken to a mass rally for denouncing their \u201ccrimes.\u201d Then, they were killed in public or by the public. Sometimes the local CPC and militia officials considered that it might be dangerous to take the victims to the public. They would then quietly send a team of armed militia to the victims' homes to carry out the slaughter. The victims would often be informed while away from home that an issue had risen requiring them to return, in order to lure the victims back home where their killers would be waiting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Daoxian Massacre|last=Zhang|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThose directly involved in the \"executions\" were rewarded for their work with higher salaries than they earned by their regular employment in the commune or district, an incentive that was a major factor for the high number of people who participated in the killings; a number of local CPC and militia officials personally led the killings. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the lack of law enforcement, local criminals also joined in the violence. Most of those in the militias were social outcasts and little respected people who sought to earn honor by participating in the killings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Methods of killing ===\nVictims were killed in a number of ways, including shooting, beating, drowning, explosion (with dynamites), [[decapitation]], hanging, burning, and so on.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ywang.uchicago.edu/history/daoxiandiaoca.htm|script-title=zh:\u516c\u5143\u4e00\u4e5d\u516d\u4e03\u5e74\u590f\u672b\u79cb\u521d\u6e56\u5357\u9053\u53bf\u519c\u6751\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=Zhang|first=Cheng|date=|website=The University of Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Death toll ===\nThe episode of mass violence in Daoxian eventually spread to other counties in Hunan province as other groups wanted to cleanse their own areas of \"counter-revolutionaries\". Eventually, after receiving serious complaints from survivors of the massacre, on August 29 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]] and the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee sent the 47th Field Army to force all local CPC and militia members to stop the killing.

Mao endorsed the revolutionary discourse and the attacks on authority figures, who he believed had grown complacent, bureaucratic, and anti-revolutionary. Local Red Guards attacked anyone who they believed lacked revolutionary credentials, and then eventually turned on those who simply failed to wholeheartedly support their efforts and intentions. In August 1966, the Central Committee issued a directive entitled the \u201cDecision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\u201d (a.k.a. the Sixteen Points) in an effort to define the revolution\u2019s goals. Later that month, Mao began to greet huge parades of [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] holding aloft his [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Introduction to the Cultural Revolution|last = Spence|first = Jonathan|publisher = Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute For International Studies|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Stanford University|pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe movement grew but also splintered into independent movements and Red Guard factions, each with its own vision of the movement.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, 1966-1976|url = http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cultrev.htm|website = www.sjsu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}</ref> Despite official directives and encouragement from the Party leadership, local forces were left to act according to their own definitions of the Revolution's goals, and many of them ended up inflicting violence upon their communities and clashing with each other. Nobody wanted to be considered a \u201creactionary,\u201d but in the absence of official guidelines for identifying \u201ctrue Communists,\u201d almost everyone became a target of abuse. People tried to protect themselves and escape persecution by attacking friends and even their own families. The result was a bewildering series of attacks and counterattacks, factional fighting, unpredictable violence, and the breakdown of authority throughout China.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The build-up to massacre ===\nBy the time of the massacre, Dao County had not yet established its own local [[Revolutionary committee (China)|revolutionary committee]] to deal with \"[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]\". Thus, local army officers were the administrators of the county\u2019s leading group for \u201cgrasping revolution and promoting production\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = The Dao County Massacre of 1967|url = http://www.massviolence.org/The-Dao-County-Massacre-of-1967?artpage=1-7|website = www.massviolence.org|date = 2009-03-25|accessdate = 2015-11-15|first = Online Encyclopedia of Mass|last = Violence}}</ref>\n\nAt two countywide meetings on August 5 and August 11, Liu Shibing, the Political Commissar of the county's militia headquarters, spread a conspiracy rumor: [[Chiang Kai-shek]]\u2019s [[Kuomintang|Nationalist troops]] were going to attack mainland China, and the county\u2019s class enemies, particularly the [[Five Black Categories]], planned to rise in rebellion in cooperation with Chiang\u2019s war plan. In addition, Liu claimed that a number of people under the Five Black Categories\" in Dao County \"had plotted to kill all Communist party members and poor- and lower-middle peasant leaders in the county.\" Liu Shibing, along with Xiong Binen, Deputy-Secretariat of the Dao County CPC Committee, ordered all levels of militia personnel and security officers to start an urgent preemptive attack against the class enemies. Although they did not specifically state the word \u201ckill\u201d, all levels of party leadership understood the meaning of this strong signal. There is no doubt that those government officials at the highest county rank were the decision-makers. They not only manufactured an imminent threat to justify the approaching massacre but instructed their subordinates to execute the killing as well.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Massacre ==\n\n=== Target population ===\nAlmost everyone could be a target during the massacre. Victims ranged in age from a ten-day-old infant to a 78-year-old grandfather. Those killed or driven to suicide not only included people deemed \"[[Five Black Categories]]\", but sometimes were killed due to personal resentment and a history of conflicts from local authorities and residents, who often abused their power to settle personal disputes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe district and commune level instigators created their own brutal and lawless way of organizing the massacres in their areas. Prior to the executions they would often hold a short \u201ctrial\u201d (lasting only a few minutes) in the lawlessly created \u201cSupreme Court of the Poor and Lower-middle Peasants\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The \u201cjudges\u201d were unsurprisingly the local leaders who prearranged the killings. If the victims were sentenced to death (and they almost always were amid the corruption and lawlessness), they were trussed up by armed militia and taken to a mass rally for denouncing their \u201ccrimes.\u201d Then, they were killed in public or by the public. Sometimes the local CPC and militia officials considered that it might be dangerous to take the victims to the public. They would then quietly send a team of armed militia to the victims' homes to carry out the slaughter. The victims would often be informed while away from home that an issue had risen requiring them to return, in order to lure the victims back home where their killers would be waiting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Daoxian Massacre|last=Zhang|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThose directly involved in the \"executions\" were rewarded for their work with higher salaries than they earned by their regular employment in the commune or district, an incentive that was a major factor for the high number of people who participated in the killings; a number of local CPC and militia officials personally led the killings. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the lack of law enforcement, local criminals also joined in the violence. Most of those in the militias were social outcasts and little respected people who sought to earn honor by participating in the killings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Methods of killing ===\nVictims were killed in a number of ways, including shooting, beating, drowning, explosion (with dynamites), [[decapitation]], hanging, burning, and so on.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ywang.uchicago.edu/history/daoxiandiaoca.htm|script-title=zh:\u516c\u5143\u4e00\u4e5d\u516d\u4e03\u5e74\u590f\u672b\u79cb\u521d\u6e56\u5357\u9053\u53bf\u519c\u6751\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=Zhang|first=Cheng|date=|website=The University of Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Death toll ===\nThe episode of mass violence in Daoxian eventually spread to other counties in Hunan province as other groups wanted to cleanse their own areas of \"counter-revolutionaries\". Eventually, after receiving serious complaints from survivors of the massacre, on August 29 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]] and the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee sent the 47th Field Army to force all local CPC and militia members to stop the killing.

The series centers on the [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] [[Griffin family]], which consists of father [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] (MacFarlane), mother [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] ([[Alex Borstein]]), daughter [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] ([[Lacey Chabert]] in episodes 1\u20139, then [[Mila Kunis]] in \"[[Da Boom]]\" onwards), son [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] ([[Seth Green]]), baby [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] (MacFarlane), and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] (MacFarlane), the family dog. The show is set in the fictional town of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]],<!--PLEASE DO ''not'' EDIT THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WITH PERSONAL BIAS--> and lampoons [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], often in the form of [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]], and tangential [[sketch comedy|vignettes]].\n\nThe concept of ''Family Guy'' was conceived by MacFarlane in 1995 while studying animation at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. He created two shorts entitled [[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry & Steve'']], both of which played a key role in Fox executives' decision to pick up the series in 1998. After two seasons, Fox decided to cancel the show.

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for [[gun control]] that followed  mass shootings in [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas]], Nevada and [[Sutherland Springs church shooting|Sutherland Springs]], Texas, in October and November 2017.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the sheriff's office received a number of [[tip (law enforcement)|tips]] about Cruz's threats to carry out a school shooting. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] learned that a [[YouTube]] user with the username \"nikolas cruz\" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but the agency could not identify the user. In January 2018, someone contacted the FBI tip line with a direct complaint that Cruz had made a death threat, but the complaint was not forwarded to the local FBI office.\n\nFollowing the massacre, the anger and frustration of Parkland student survivors intensified towards the inaction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated legislature on the wider issue of [[mass shooting]]s and [[gun violence]]. The students founded [[Never Again MSD]], an [[advocacy group]] that lobbies for legislative action on gun violence. On {{nowrap|March 9}}, Governor [[Rick Scott]] signed a bill that raised the minimum age for buying rifles in Florida from 18 to 21. The legislation also established waiting periods and [[background check]]s for gun buyers. The law allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of [[School resource officer]]s.

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for [[gun control]] that followed  mass shootings in [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas]], Nevada and [[Sutherland Springs church shooting|Sutherland Springs]], Texas, in October and November 2017.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the sheriff's office received a number of [[tip (law enforcement)|tips]] about Cruz's threats to carry out a school shooting. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] learned that a [[YouTube]] user with the username \"nikolas cruz\" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but the agency could not identify the user. In January 2018, someone contacted the FBI tip line with a direct complaint that Cruz had made a death threat, but the complaint was not forwarded to the local FBI office.\n\nFollowing the massacre, the anger and frustration of Parkland student survivors intensified towards the inaction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated legislature on the wider issue of [[mass shooting]]s and [[gun violence]]. The students founded [[Never Again MSD]], an [[advocacy group]] that lobbies for legislative action on gun violence. On {{nowrap|March 9}}, Governor [[Rick Scott]] signed a bill that raised the minimum age for buying rifles in Florida from 18 to 21. The legislation also established waiting periods and [[background check]]s for gun buyers. The law allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of [[School resource officer]]s. [[Bump stock]]s would now be banned and some potentially violent or mentally unstable people would be prohibited from possessing guns.<ref name=Bill/><ref name=\"Sanchez\">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/us/florida-gov-scott-gun-bill/index.html |title=Florida Gov.

{"title_page": "History of the Kansas City Chiefs", "text_new": "{{short description|Sports team history}}\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs wordmark.svg|right|200px]]\nThe following is a detailed '''history of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]''', a professional [[American football]] franchise that began play in 1960 as the '''Dallas Texans'''. The team was a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and now is currently part of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) (they are not associated with an earlier [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] NFL team that only played for one season in 1952).\n\nThe Texans won the AFL Championship in 1962, and the team relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the following year. In 1966, the Chiefs won their second AFL title and appeared in the [[Super Bowl I|inaugural AFL-NFL World Championship game]]. In 1969, the Chiefs won the final AFL title and went on to defeat the NFL's [[Spread betting|heavily favored]] [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[Super Bowl IV]]. The Texans/Chiefs were the most victorious franchise in AFL history, compiling an 87\u201348\u20135 record from 1960 to 1969. They won the Super Bowl in January 1970, and February 2, 2020, at 09:12 p.m. Central.\n\n==AFL origins==\n{{details|topic=more information on the AFL's origins|American Football League}}\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]], son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]], began discussions with other businessmen in establishing an American football organization that would rival that of the [[National Football League]]. Since as early as 1958, Hunt had the interest of purchasing an NFL franchise and moving them to [[Dallas, Texas]]. His desire to secure a professional football franchise was further heightened after watching the historic [[1958 NFL Championship Game]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. The team that Hunt was most interested in buying was the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ Kansas City Chiefs History AFL Origins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |date=2007-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe NFL convinced Hunt to contact Cardinals owner [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner]], and her husband Walter Wolfner eventually agreed to sell Hunt 20 percent of the Cardinals franchise. Hunt declined the opportunity. He then conceived the concept of forming a second league. \"Why wouldn't a second league work\", Hunt recalled. \"There was an [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] in baseball, why not football?\" Hunt contacted several other individuals who had expressed interest in the Cardinals franchise\u2014[[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], [[Max Winter]] and Bill Boyer\u2014and gauged their interest in forming a second league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nOn August 14, the first meeting of the new league was held in [[Chicago]]. Charter memberships were issued to six original cities \u2014 Dallas, [[New York Jets|New York]], [[Houston Oilers|Houston]], [[Denver Broncos|Denver]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]] and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minneapolis]]. The league was officially christened the American Football League on August 22. [[Ralph Wilson]] was extended the league's [[Buffalo Bills|seventh franchise]] on October 28 and [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] became the league's [[New England Patriots|eighth team]]'s owner on November 22. Minneapolis withdrew its franchise from the AFL in November after receiving an offer for a team in the NFL,<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/> and [[Oakland, California]] instead joined the AFL as the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n===Early years in Dallas===\n[[File:Swink fleer 1960.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Jim Swink]] on a [[Fleer]] [[American Football Card|football card]] of 1960]]\nFor the [[1960 Dallas Texans season|Texans' inaugural season]], team owner Lamar Hunt pursued both legendary [[University of Oklahoma]] coach [[Bud Wilkinson]] and [[New York Giants]] defensive assistant [[Tom Landry]] to lead his Texans franchise. Wilkinson opted to stay at Oklahoma, while Landry was destined to coach the NFL's franchise in Dallas. In mid-December 1959 Hunt settled on a relatively unknown assistant coach from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], [[Hank Stram]]. \"One of the biggest reasons I hired Hank was that he really wanted the job\", Hunt explained. \"It turned out to be a very lucky selection on my part.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nThe Texans were very fortunate to have [[Don Klosterman (American football)|Don Klosterman]] as their head talent man. Klosterman had a penchant for luring star talent away from the NFL, and for finding talent otherwise undiscovered.\n\nReserved seats at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] cost [[United States Dollars|USD $4]], general admission $2 and high school students paid 90\u00a2 (90 cents) that initial season. [[Don Rossi]] served as the team's [[General Manager (American football)|General Manager]] until November when he was succeeded by [[Jack Steadman]]. The team was headquartered in the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. The AFL was also headquartered in Dallas.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans conducted their inaugural training camp at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. The club embarked on a whirlwind pre-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorm]]ing tour that featured road games in Oakland, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Boston]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. An announced crowd of 51,000 at the Cotton Bowl witnessed a 24\u20133 victory against [[1960 Houston Oilers season|Houston]] on September 2 as the club concluded a perfect 6\u20130 preseason record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn both teams first 1960 season, the Dallas Texans and Dallas Cowboys competed on ticket sales.  For example, according to the book ''Ten-Gallon War'', the Texans offered discounted tickets at department stores and airline offices, free tickets for fill-ups at certain service stations, and even had free tickets \"stuffed inside helium-filled balloons set loose over the city.\"  In competition, the Dallas Cowboys had such promotions as hiring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for a halftime show.\n<ref name=\"Ten-Gallon War, John Eisenberg, 2012\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T91c2BFKKzAC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=%22stuffed+inside+helium-filled+balloons+set+loose+over+the+city%22&source=bl&ots=WPJ3V-zPFG&sig=Dt2ImLFn2MYlM6e8tO0z6hT1ss0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik2bHIhtPfAhUrgK0KHUotBGkQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stuffed%20inside%20helium-filled%20balloons%20set%20loose%20over%20the%20city%22&f=false Ten-Gallon War: The NFL\u2019s Cowboys, the AFL\u2019s Texans, and the Feud for Dallas's Pro Football Future], John Eisenberg, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012.</ref>\n\nIn their early years, the Texans had a strong home-state identity with [[quarterback]] [[Cotton Davidson]] from [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[linebacker]] [[Sherrill Headrick]] from [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] and [[running back]] [[Abner Haynes]] from [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]]. Haynes led the league with 875 rushing yards and nine TDs, as well as combined net yards (2,100) and punt return average (15.4).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Texans also had a flashy, high-scoring club which finished the year at 8\u20136 as three close losses kept the squad from challenging for the division title. The Texans averaged 24,500 for their home games, the highest average in the league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> In one attempt to draw more fans to their games, the Texans would offer free tickets to anyone who brought a ticket stub from the previous Friday's high school football game, to counter the NFL Cowboys' playing their home games on Friday night.\n\nIn [[1961 Dallas Texans season|1961]], the Texans and the NFL's Dallas Cowboys both drafted linebacker [[E.J. Holub]] from [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], described by many scouts as \"the best football player in America.\" Holub decided to play for the Texans, joining three future franchise Hall of Famers\u2014[[Jerry Mays (defensive lineman)|Jerry Mays]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Jim Tyrer]]\u2014as part of the club's draft class. The club moved its training camp to Lamar Hunt's [[alma mater]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] and started the regular season at 3\u20131 before hitting a six-game losing skid, the longest such streak of Stram's tenure with the franchise. The Texans rebounded to claim wins in three of its final four contests to finish 6\u20138, marking the club's second straight finish behind the [[1961 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in the AFL Western Conference standings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1962 Dallas Texans season|1962]], head coach Hank Stram was named AFL Coach of the Year and running back [[Curtis McClinton]] was named the AFL Rookie of the Year. Haynes became the franchise's first 1,000-yard rusher, concluding the season with 1,049 yards and an AFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans clinched their initial AFL Western Division Championship in November and finished with an 11\u20133 regular season record. The team won the [[1962 AFL Championship Game|1962 AFL Championship]] when [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Tommy Brooker]] connected on a 25-yard field goal during the second overtime of the title game, giving the Texans a 20\u201317 victory against the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]. Spanning an elapsed time of 77:54, the game stands as the third-longest contest in pro football history.<ref>Since 1984 the game has been the third-longest professional football game following a triple-overtime [[United States Football League|USFL]] playoff game between the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] and the [[Michigan Panthers]].</ref> Until a [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas Day]] playoff game in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1971]] between the [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] and [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]], the game was the longest ever played.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n===The move to Kansas City===\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] joined the NFL as an [[expansion team]] in {{nfly|1960}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1951\u20131960|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960#1960|publisher=National Football League|date=September 28, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the 1962 season, it was apparent that Dallas could not support two teams.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Even though the Texans had been far more successful on the field, Hunt investigated opportunities to move his team elsewhere for the [[1963 Kansas City Chiefs season|1963 season]], including [[Miami]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Seattle]] and [[New Orleans]]. Hunt wanted to find a city to which he could commute easily from Dallas, and when he was unable to secure [[Tulane Stadium]] because [[Tulane University|the university]] didn't want its [[Tulane Green Wave football|football program]] to compete with a pro team, he turned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where [[Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor]] [[H. Roe Bartle]] persuaded him to move to the Midwest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\"/>\n\nThe negotiations in Kansas City were conducted in secrecy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> On several occasions Hunt and Jack Steadman were in Kansas City and met with businessmen, without the general public's knowledge. Bartle introduced Hunt as \"Mr. Lamar\" in all the meetings with other Kansas City businessmen. Steadman was introduced as \"Jack X.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\">Covitz, Randy; Pulliam, Kent. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/special_packages/lamar_hunt/16234939.htm Chiefs' founder Lamar Hunt dies] ''Kansas City Star'', 14 December 2006.</ref>\n\nThe support the team received from the Kansas City community before the team announced the move was extraordinary. Hunt made the move dependent upon the ability of Mayor Bartle and the Kansas City community to guarantee him 35,000 in season ticket sales. Hunt had set this number, being that it was the Texans' average attendance at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. An ambitious campaign took shape to deliver on Bartle's guarantee to Hunt of tripling the season-ticket base the Texans had enjoyed in Dallas. Kansas City's mayor also promised to add 3,000 permanent seats to [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]], as well as 11,000 temporary bleacher seats. Along with Bartle, a number of other prominent Kansas Citians stepped forward to aid in the efforts, putting together more than 1,000 workers to sell season tickets.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nBartle called to his office 20 business leaders and called upon them to form an association later known as \"The Gold Coats\", whose sole objective was to sell and take down payments on the 35,000 season tickets required. \"The Gold Coats\" had to sell season tickets to people without knowing the team name, where it was coming from, who the owner was, which football league they would play in, who the players or coaches were, when the team would play its first game in Kansas City, or where it would play. Hunt gave Bartle a four-month deadline to accomplish the sales. Bartle and \"The Gold Coats\" made good in only 8 weeks. Later, Hunt admitted he was really only hoping for 20,000, for which he still would have moved the franchise. On May 22, Hunt announced he was moving the franchise to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ Kansas City Chiefs History 1960s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421185300/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |date=2007-04-21 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DallasTexansFootballClubNamingContestChiefs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Football Club Naming Contest Letter from Lamar Hunt]]\nHunt, with a roster replete with players who had played college football in Texas, wanted to maintain a lineage to the team's roots and wanted to name the club the '''Kansas City Texans'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\" /> \"The [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] stayed the Lakers when they moved from Minnesota to California\", he reasoned. \"But Jack Steadman convinced me that wasn't too smart.

The first appearance of the Chiefs in Municipal Stadium attracted just 5,721 fans for a 17\u201313 pre-season victory against [[1963 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on August 9.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs' inaugural season in Kansas City began with owner Lamar Hunt's trade of starting quarterback [[Cotton Davidson]] to the Oakland Raiders, which landed the number one overall selection in the [[1963 AFL Draft|AFL Draft]] (which they used to select [[Buck Buchanan]]). Ironically, the Raiders would later select [[Gene Upshaw]] in [[1967 AFL Draft|1967]] for the express purpose of blocking Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs also selected guard [[Ed Budde]] from [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] with their other first round pick, and [[Bobby Bell]] from [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] in the seventh round. Buchanan, Budde and Bell all became starters on their way to a combined 526 games with the team and all three of them played their entire careers with the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nTragedy struck the club when rookie running back [[Stone Johnson]], who was a sprinter in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, suffered a fractured vertebra in his neck in a pre-season game against [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on August 30 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. He died 10 days later on September 8 and his jersey number 33 was subsequently retired.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs finished their first season in Kansas City with a 5\u20137\u20132 record and failed to reappear in the AFL Championship game for a consecutive year.\n\n===Building a champion, 1964\u20131969===\nIn [[1964 Kansas City Chiefs season|1964]], the Chiefs began the year with a 2\u20131 mark before dropping three consecutive games as several of the team's best players, including [[E.J. Holub]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] missed numerous games with injuries. Arbanas missed the final two games of the year after undergoing surgery to his left eye, in which he suffered almost total loss of vision. Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]], who signed with the club as a rookie free agent and received a mere $300 signing bonus, entered the starting lineup and earned a spot in the [[AFL All-Star Game]]. The club rounded out the season with two consecutive wins to close the season at 7\u20137, finishing second in the AFL Western Conference behind the [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. An average of just 18,126 fans attended each home game at Municipal Stadium, prompting discussion at the AFL owners' meeting about the Chiefs future in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor the [[1965 Kansas City Chiefs season|1965 season]], the Chiefs were once again caught in the middle of the AFL and NFL's bidding wars for college talent. Kansas City made running back [[Gale Sayers]] from the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]] their first-round draft pick, but Sayers eventually signed with the Bears for less money.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]] suffered torn ligaments in his right knee in the second to last regular season game of the year at Buffalo on December 12. Following what was expected to be a routine surgery on December 14 at Menorah Hospital in Kansas City, Hill died from what was termed \"a sudden and massive [[embolism]].\" Hunt called Hill's death \"the worst shock possible.\" Beginning the following year, the club annually bestowed the Mack Lee Hill Award on its top rookie or first-year performer in Hill's honor. Just days after Hill's unexpected death, the mourning Chiefs defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] on December 19 to finish the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]], the Chiefs were beginning to lay the groundwork for a return to the AFL Championship game and eventual dominance in the later years of the AFL. Team owner Lamar Hunt was publicly negotiating with NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] about a possible merger of the two leagues. [[Defensive end]] [[Aaron Brown (defensive lineman)|Aaron Brown]] was highly coveted by many clubs, including the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], who intended to select him. The Steelers couldn't locate Brown on draft day since he was already aboard a flight with Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who carried out the first mid-air signing in team history. The Chiefs signed [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Mike Garrett]] in the 20th round of the [[1966 AFL Draft]]. Garrett went on to earn AFL Rookie of the Year honors for the 1966 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs started the season at 3\u20130. A crowd of 43,885 attended the Chiefs home opener against the defending AFL Champion [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] on October 2, the largest ever to witness a sports event in Kansas City at the time. The Chiefs dropped a 29\u201314 decision to the Bills, but after the contest, Chiefs coach Hank Stram and Buffalo head coach [[Joe Collier]] negotiated a trade in the middle of the field. Kansas City received placekicker [[Mike Mercer (American football)|Mike Mercer]] for a fifth-round pick. Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the league in passing, while [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] became the first 1,000-yard receiver in franchise history, registering 1,297 yards. The Chiefs finished three games in front of Oakland to claim an AFL Western Conference title with an 11\u20132\u20131 record, setting the stage for the franchise's second trip to the [[1966 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|The Chiefs and the Packers in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I)]]\nUsing a dazzling [[I-formation|I-formation offense]] and a smothering defense, the Chiefs claimed a dominating 31\u20137 victory in the AFL title game at Buffalo on [[New Year's Day]], 1967. That victory propelled Kansas City to the [[Super Bowl I|first AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as the [[Super Bowl]]. At the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Chiefs met [[Vince Lombardi]]'s powerful [[Green Bay Packers]] of the National Football League on January 15, 1967. The Chiefs played the Packers close for a half, trailing 14\u201310, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor [[1967 Kansas City Chiefs season|1967]], the club's special teams got a boost with the addition of kicker [[Jan Stenerud]], and [[kick returner]] [[Noland Smith|Noland \"Super Gnat\" Smith]]. The Chiefs' first regular season game against an NFL team resulted in a commanding 66\u201324 Chiefs victory against the [[1967 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] at Municipal Stadium on August 23. Injuries again hit the club hard during the regular season as the Chiefs clawed their way to a 9\u20135 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nInterest in the team skyrocketed following the team's appearance in the AFL-NFL Championship Game, forcing an increase in [[seating capacity]] at Municipal Stadium from 40,000 to 47,000. In June, [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] voters approved a $43 million bond issue for construction of a sports complex<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> to be completed by 1972. Eastern Jackson County was chosen as the site of the Chiefs and Royals' new stadiums, and groundbreaking ceremonies took place in July with plans calling for a unique \"rolling roof\" design (which was later scrapped).\n\nThe [[1968 Kansas City Chiefs season|1968 Chiefs]] defense allowed a franchise-low 170 points (12.1 ppg). The nucleus of the defensive unit was in its prime, producing six AFL All-Stars, including all three of the squad's linebackers. Offensively, quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the AFL in passing for the fourth time. The Chiefs began the season with a 7\u20131 record and rattled off five straight victories to close the regular season at 12\u20132, sharing the AFL Western Conference title with the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and setting up a one-game playoff between the two teams. Kansas City lost a 41\u20136 decision at Oakland on December 22 as the Raiders advanced to the [[American Football League playoffs#1968 Championship|1968 AFL Championship Game]] against the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The loss to Oakland is considered to be the beginning of the [[Chiefs-Raiders rivalry|Chiefs' rivalry with the Raiders]], one of the NFL's most [[National Football League rivalries|bitter feuds]].\n\nThe Chiefs used the momentum they built during the 1968 campaign by posting a perfect 6\u20130 record during pre-season play for [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]]. The team began the regular season with four consecutive road games for the only time in team history. After a decisive 27\u20139 win at [[1969 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 14, the club posted a 31\u20130 shutout at [[1969 Boston Patriots season|Boston]] on September 21. During the game, quarterback Len Dawson sustained a knee injury which would sideline him for the following two months.\n\nThe once-optimistic picture for the Chiefs went from bad to worse the following week when back-up quarterback [[Jacky Lee (American football)|Jacky Lee]] went down with a broken ankle in a 24\u201319 loss at [[1969 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] on September 28. That injury left the team's most crucial position in the hands of second-year quarterback [[Mike Livingston]], who took just five snaps as a rookie in 1968.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> However, Livingston engineered a five-game winning streak, while getting plenty of help from the club's defense. The team's home opener was played in a day-long deluge referred to as a \"frog-strangler\" by Chiefs radio broadcaster [[Bill Grigsby]]. The Chiefs and [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] combined for 14 fumbles in a 24\u20130 Kansas City victory on October 12. Len Dawson returned to the starting lineup in a 27\u20133 win against San Diego on November 9 and guided the club to three wins in the season's next four games.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the [[1969 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 31\u201317 on [[NFL Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving Day]]. Trailing 24\u201317 late in the game, Denver attempted an [[onside kick]] that was recovered by linebacker Bobby Bell, who promptly returned that kick for a 53-yard [[touchdown]]. Mike Livingston started the following week against [[1969 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on December 7 for an again-injured Dawson, who returned for the regular season finale at Oakland on December 13. A 10\u20136 loss against the Raiders gave the Chiefs an 11\u20133 record, good for second in the AFC Western Conference behind [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] (12\u20131\u20131).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = The Chiefs topped the Raiders in the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL championship game]] (''left'') and went on to defeat the Vikings in Super Bowl IV (''right'').\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = 1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg\n | width1 = 140\n | image2 =1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp.jpg\n | width2 = 140\n}}\nIn an AFL Divisional Playoff Game at [[1969 New York Jets season|New York]], Kansas City rode its dominating defense which produced a crucial goal-line stand en route to a 13\u20136 win over the [[Super Bowl III|defending Super Bowl champion]] Jets to set up a rematch with the Raiders in the [[1969 AFL Championship|final AFL Championship Game]]. Looking for retribution of the previous losses in the regular season and in the 1968 playoffs, the Chiefs became the league's only three-time champions, defeating the Raiders by a 17\u20137 count at Oakland on January 4, 1970.\n\nDuring the days preceding Kansas City's clash with the [[spread betting|heavily favored]] [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] of the NFL, unsubstantiated media reports associating Len Dawson with a known gambler hounded the Chiefs quarterback.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Dawson was later revealed to be mistaken for another man with the same last name. The night before Super Bowl IV, [[Ed Sabol]] of [[NFL Films]] approached Vikings coach [[Bud Grant]] about being wired for sound for the game. Grant declined, but Chiefs coach [[Hank Stram]] accepted. As both the Chiefs and the cameras rolled, Stram clamored for his team to run \"65 toss power trap\" and to \"keep matriculating the ball down the field.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Stram became the first-ever coach to be wired for NFL Films, and ironically, as a coach in the rival AFL.\n\nThe Chiefs used the game as a crusade for the American Football League and wore \"AFL-10\" patches honoring the league's 10-year existence. The Chiefs used three field goals from Jan Stenerud and a rushing touchdown from Mike Garrett to take a 16\u20130 halftime lead. A dynamic 46-yard TD pass from Len Dawson to Otis Taylor in the third quarter sealed the victory as Dawson was named the game's [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Perhaps the grittiest performance of the day came from [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], who registered two interceptions and a fumble recovery despite playing with three broken ribs. At approximately 5:20 PM, the final seconds ticked off the clock at [[Tulane Stadium]] as the Chiefs were crowned World Champions by claiming a 23\u20137 victory in the final game between the AFL and NFL.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A victory parade ensued upon the club's triumphant return the following day in [[downtown Kansas City]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Super Bowl IV]] was the last championship won by the Chiefs until [[Super Bowl LIV]],\n\n==Alignment to the NFL==\n\n===Fall from glory, 1970\u20131977===\nFollowing their championship win, the NFL-AFL merger placed the Chiefs in the newly created AFC West division with the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos. The team traded running back Mike Garrett to San Diego in [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]] and replaced him in the lineup with [[Ed Podolak]]. Despite a 44\u201324 win against [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] on September 28 in just the second-ever telecast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' package, the Chiefs owned a 3\u20133\u20131 record at the season's midpoint. The Chiefs and the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] tied a game at 17\u201317 on November 1 following a controversial play from Oakland. The Chiefs were ahead 17\u201314 when Len Dawson apparently sealed the win, running for a first down which would have allowed Kansas City to run out the clock. While on the ground, Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]] in an infamous incident that cost the Chiefs a victory and further inflamed the already heated Chiefs-Raiders rivalry.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wide receiver Otis Taylor retaliated and a bench-clearing brawl ensued. Offsetting penalties were called, nullifying Dawson's first down. The Chiefs were forced to punt and Raiders kicker [[George Blanda]] booted a game-tying field goal with eight seconds remaining. That tie ultimately cost the Chiefs the opportunity to split the AFC West division title with Oakland as Kansas City finished the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record, while the Raiders went 8\u20134\u20132 and reached the conference championship.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = I always thought that our best team was the peak of our best team, our '71 squad.\n| source = -[[Lamar Hunt]]<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n| salign = right\n}}\n\nIn [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|1971]], the Chiefs were regarded by many as the finest squad ever assembled by the franchise, including team owner Lamar Hunt. The team featured a franchise record 11 Pro Bowlers. Offensively, wide receiver Otis Taylor led the league with 1,110 receiving yards. In just his third pro season, Ed Podolak surpassed Abner Haynes as the all-time leading rusher in team history. The longstanding linebacking trio of Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell and Jim Lynch was the league's best. The offensive line was headlined by guard Ed Budde and tackle Jim Tyrer, while the defensive front featured a pair of Pro Bowlers in tackles Buck Buchanan and [[Curley Culp]].

A 16\u201314 victory against Oakland on December 12 gave the franchise its initial AFC West title.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The great promise of the 1971 campaign ended dramatically in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs#AFC: Miami Dolphins 27.2C Kansas City Chiefs 24 .282OT.29|the longest game]] in NFL history, an AFC Divisional Playoff Game played on Christmas Day against the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. It took 82:40<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> to finish the contest, but a 37-yard field goal from Dolphins kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] finally ended this epic as Miami claimed a 27\u201324 double [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] win in the final football contest played at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium. Chiefs' running back Ed Podolak accounted for 350 combined net yards, a figure that remains an NFL post-season record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The baton of power in the AFC was officially passed to the Dolphins, who went on to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. It would be the Chiefs' last playoff appearance for 15 years, effectively signaling the conclusion of the franchise's glory days.\n\nIn [[1972 Kansas City Chiefs season|1972]], the last original member of the 1960 Dallas Texans team departed when safety [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] announced his retirement at training camp. Meanwhile, starting quarterback Len Dawson ended speculation about his retirement by signing a two-year contract. Franchise owner Lamar Hunt became the first AFL figure to be inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on July 29.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nAfter two different construction strikes and a myriad of other delays, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] was officially dedicated on August 12 when the Chiefs registered a 24\u201314 victory against the [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. Running back Ed Podolak scored the first touchdown in the facility. Regular season ticket prices for the team's first season at Arrowhead were [[USD]]$8 for box seats and $7 for reserved seating.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOn September 17, the Chiefs lost a 20\u201310 decision against Miami in the first regular season game at Arrowhead in front of a crowd of 79,829.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A standing-room-only crowd of 82,094 fans was in attendance for a 27\u201314 victory against [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5, the largest \"in-house\" attendance total for an NFL contest in Arrowhead's history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After a 5\u20133 start, a three-game losing streak effectively eliminated the club from playoff contention, including an embarrassing home loss to the winless Philadelphia Eagles. An 8\u20136 record was good enough for only a second-place finish in the AFC West behind Oakland. Linebacker Willie Lanier became the first Chiefs player to receive the NFL Man of the Year Award in the offseason.\n\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket) (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Dawson pictured later in his career with the Chiefs]]\nFor [[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|1973]], quarterback Mike Livingston started in a 23\u201313 Opening Day loss against [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], but Len Dawson returned to rally the club for three consecutive wins to get the club off to a 3\u20131 start for a third consecutive year. The aging Len Dawson made his final start of the year in a 23\u201314 loss at [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 29 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and was replaced for the remainder of the year by Livingston, beginning a string of three straight seasons in which both players split time at the position.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Livingston led the club to another three straight wins, putting the team in first place in mid-November with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A 1\u20132\u20131 ledger over the season's final month ended the club's post-season aspirations as the team finished the year in a second-place tie with [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at 7\u20135\u20132. Len Dawson became the second Chiefs player in as many years to win the NFL Man of the Year Award. Following [[Super Bowl VIII]], The [[1974 Pro Bowl|AFC-NFC Pro Bowl]] was held at Arrowhead Stadium on January 20 with the AFC claiming a 15\u201313 win thanks to five field goals from Miami placekicker Garo Yepremian.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWhile the club's sparkling new facility at Arrowhead Stadium was drawing rave reviews, the Chiefs roster was beginning to show its age in [[1974 Kansas City Chiefs season|1974]]. The result was the team's first losing season in 11 years as the club was unable to string together consecutive victories during the year, a first in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Most of the team's starters were advancing in age: Len Dawson was 39, Jim Tyrer was 35, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, and Ed Budde were 34, Dave Hill was 33 and Otis Taylor was 32.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOne of the year's few bright spots in the 5\u20139 season was cornerback [[Emmitt Thomas]], who led the league with a franchise-record 12 interceptions. The final game of the 1974 campaign marked the final time all five of Kansas City's future Hall of Fame players from the club's AFL championship era took the field together with coach Hank Stram. Including Lamar Hunt and five future Minnesota Vikings Hall of Famers, an amazing total of 12 Hall of Fame inductees were involved in that 1974 season finale game. That 35\u201315 loss against Super Bowl-bound [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] provided an anticlimactic conclusion to Hank Stram's illustrious coaching career in Kansas City. Stram, the only head coach in franchise history was relieved of his duties on December 27 after compiling a 124\u201376\u201310 regular season record with the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n[[San Francisco 49ers]] defensive coordinator [[Paul Wiggin]] was named the second head coach in franchise history on January 23, [[1975 Kansas City Chiefs season|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wiggin inherited the unenviable task of rebuilding a squad whose pool of talent had been largely depleted due to age and a number of ill-considered trades that had left the club devoid of first-round draft choices in [[1973 NFL Draft|1973]] and [[1975 NFL Draft|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After an 0\u20133 start to the season, Wiggin directed the Chiefs to three straight wins, beginning with a convincing 42\u201310 victory against the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. The highlight of the season was a 34\u201331 upset win at Dallas on ''Monday Night Football''. The club could not maintain the early success; owning a 5\u20135 record heading into the home stretch of the season, injuries to a number of key players crippled the team. The team dropped its final four contests of the year to finish at 5\u20139 for the second consecutive season. The regular season finale at Oakland marked the final games in the Hall of Fame careers of Len Dawson and Buck Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBy [[1976 Kansas City Chiefs season|1976]], many of the Chiefs' championship players were on their way out of Kansas City. Buck Buchanan announced his retirement in February, while Dawson announced his own departure on May 1.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Off the field, Jack Steadman was promoted to team president and [[Jim Schaaf]] was named general manager in August. On the field, Kansas City's fortunes didn't improve in the second year of the Wiggin regime. The club dropped three straight home games, including a 27\u201317 loss to a [[1976 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] team coached by Stram, before suffering a 50\u201317 setback at [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 3, opening the season at 0\u20134 for the first time in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The team registered a 3\u20131 record during a successful midseason stretch, but like most of the previous seasons, could not maintain that momentum.\n\nAfter lingering in Len Dawson's shadow for eight seasons, Mike Livingston was firmly entrenched as the team's starting quarterback, becoming the first QB to start every regular season game since Dawson in 1968. Although Livingston played well and rallied the squad for wins in two of the season's final three games, the Chiefs still ended the year with their third consecutive 5\u20139 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Running back [[MacArthur Lane]] was the club's top offensive threat, becoming the only player at the time in franchise history to lead the league in receptions (66).\n\nOn the field, the Chiefs suffered their worst season ever in [[1977 Kansas City Chiefs season|1977]], winning just twice and undergoing a mid-season coaching change. Following three consecutive 5\u20139 seasons, the team finished with a league worst 2\u201312 record. An 0\u20135 start doomed the squad with a 44\u20137 loss at Cleveland, where Wiggin starred as a defensive lineman during the Browns' glory days, effectively sealing the coach's fate. Wiggin was relieved of his duties on [[Halloween]], marking the only in-season coaching switch in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Defensive backs coach [[Tom Bettis]] was named interim coach and claimed a 20\u201310 victory against Green Bay in the club's initial contest under his direction, but it was the only victory of his brief head coaching tenure.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBettis and the remainder of the coaching staff assembled by Wiggin were relieved on December 19, one day after a 21\u201320 loss at Oakland in the regular season finale.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Marv Levy]], the former head coach of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Montreal Alouettes]], was named the fourth head coach in franchise history the following day. The heart and soul of the Chiefs once-vaunted defense departed when Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch retired following the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n===Signs of improvement, 1978\u20131982===\nFor [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]], Marv Levy's systematic restocking of a relatively barren defensive roster began with a [[1978 NFL Draft|1978 draft class]] that included defensive end [[Art Still]] and linebacker [[Gary Spani]]. Running back Ed Podolak, who was the club's all-time leading rusher at the time, retired in the offseason on June 15.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nPerhaps Levy's most unconventional tactic in rebuilding the Chiefs was installing the \"[[Wing-T offense]]\". \"It was a situation where we took over a team that had the worst defensive record in the history of the National Football League\", Levy explained. \"We wanted to keep that defense off the field, so we ran the ball 60 times a game.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The 1978 Chiefs team ran and ran often, posting franchise records with 663 rushing attempts and 2,986 ground yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Levy's squad ran the ball a staggering 69 times in a 24\u201323 Opening Day win at Cincinnati on September 3, the most rushing attempts in an NFL contest since [[1948 NFL season|1948]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Five different players had 100-yard rushing games during the year, including running back [[Tony Reed]], who finished the season with 1,053 yards to become the team's first 1,000-yard back since 1967.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Despite the squad's Opening Day success, the club lost 10 of its next 11 games, including a pair of overtime decisions. However, the team showed signs of improvement with the defense recording a 23\u20130 shutout against [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on November 26 as the club concluded its first 16-game schedule with a 4\u201312 mark.\n\nIn [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|1979]], Kansas City owned a pair of picks in the first round of the [[1979 NFL Draft|Draft]], selecting defensive end [[Mike Bell (defensive lineman)|Mike Bell]] and quarterback [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]]. By the season's third game, Fuller had supplanted Mike Livingston as the club's starter.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWith Fuller at the helm, the Chiefs owned a 4\u20132 record after six games, but a five-game mid-season losing stretch sullied that effort. Despite finishing fifth in the AFC West for a second straight season, Kansas City's 7\u20139 record was a notable accomplishment considering the fact that the division's other four clubs all posted winning records for a second consecutive season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The Chiefs lost a 3\u20130 decision at [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on December 16 in one of the most water-logged contests in franchise annals. As both clubs struggled to move the ball under monsoon-like conditions, a late, fourth-quarter field goal by the Buccaneers averted the NFL's first scoreless tie since [[1943 NFL season|1943]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 Kansas City Chiefs season|1980]], the Chiefs selected guard [[Brad Budde]] in the first round of the [[1980 NFL Draft|Draft]], the son of former Chiefs guard Ed Budde, as the team's first-round draft choice, making the Buddes the first father-son combination to become first-round draftees of the same team in NFL history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> In a then-controversial move on August 26, the Chiefs released placekicker Jan Stenerud, who at the time was club's all-time leading scorer. He was replaced by journeyman [[Nick Lowery]], who had been cut 11 times by eight different teams himself.\n\nAfter enduring an 0\u20134 start, the club rebounded to post a four-game winning streak, starting with a 31\u201317 victory in Oakland, in which Raiders quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] broke his leg and was replaced by [[Jim Plunkett]], who guided the team to the [[Super Bowl XV]] championship. After Steve Fuller was sidelined with a knee injury late in the season, former Miami 12th-round draft choice [[Bill Kenney]] became the team's starting quarterback. He was so anonymous that when he appeared in that contest, the name on the back of his jersey was inadvertently misspelled \"Kenny.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Kenney went on to lead the club to a 31\u201314 victory against Denver on December 7 in his initial NFL start. The defense continued to evolve as defensive end Art Still and safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the first Chiefs defensive players to be elected to the Pro Bowl in five seasons. The Chiefs finished the year at 8\u20138, the club's highest victory tally since 1972.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#b0c4de; width:20em;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I've played against the best\u2014[[O.J.

Second-round draft choice, running back [[Joe Delaney]] electrified the club's offense by rushing for 1,121 yards, a team single-season record at the time. He was named the AFC's Rookie of the Year and became the first running back to represent the franchise in the Pro Bowl.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Delaney registered a 193-yard performance in a 23\u201310 victory against the [[1981 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] on November 15, the best single-game total ever amassed by a Kansas City rookie.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOwning an 8\u20134 record with four games remaining, the Chiefs were poised to make the playoffs for the first time in 10 years. However, a three-game losing streak ended the anticipation. Bill Kenney missed the club's final three contests due to injury as Steve Fuller temporarily reclaimed the starting QB position and guided the club to a 10\u20136 win at Minnesota, in the final contest played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]]. With the Chiefs winning the game, Vikings fans began dismembering the stadium as early as the second half\u2014taking seats, pieces of the scoreboard and even chunks of sod as souvenirs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The victory assured the Chiefs of a 9\u20137 record, the club's first winning mark since 1973 as coach Marv Levy increased the club's victory total for a third consecutive year. Inspired by the [[Washington Redskins]]'s \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\", Levy penned a fight song for the Chiefs (\"Give a Cheer for Kansas City\"), but much like the team's Wing-T offense, the concept never really caught on.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nIn [[1982 Kansas City Chiefs season|1982]], running back Joe Delaney underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in his eye, a radical procedure at the time.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Optimism abounded at Arrowhead thanks to the club's promising 9\u20137 record from 1981, but swelling labor unrest from NFL players spelled doom for both the Chiefs and Levy in 1982. The Chiefs split their first two games of the year before a 57-day [[1982 NFL strike|strike]] by the [[NFL Players Association]] began at midnight on September 20. The strike concluded on November 17 after six games were canceled and one was rescheduled, but the Chiefs would never recover, dropping four straight games after their return to the field. Center [[Jack Rudnay]], who had been one of the franchise's most durable and decorated offensive performers over the past decade, announced on December 20 that he would retire after the season. Despite wins in two of the season's final three games, the Levy era concluded as the club finished the strike-shortened campaign at 3\u20136.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n===Unbalanced chemistry, 1983\u20131988===\n\n====1983====\n{{details|1983 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nTo begin 1983, the Chiefs fired head coach Marv Levy on January 4 after compiling a 31\u201342 record. [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterbacks coach [[John Mackovic]] was named the fifth head coach in team history on February 2. The 39-year-old Mackovic became the youngest individual ever to hold that post for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs held the seventh overall pick in the quarterback-laden [[1983 NFL Draft]] and selected [[Todd Blackledge]]. The five other signal-callers selected in the first round that year included [[John Elway]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Tony Eason]], [[Ken O'Brien]] and [[Dan Marino]].\n\nTragedy struck the club on June 29 when Joe Delaney [[drowned]] trying to save the lives of three youngsters in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Delaney was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal by [[Ronald Reagan]] on July 13.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Linebacker Bobby Bell became the first Chiefs player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> providing some solace for the mourning Chiefs fan base following Joe Delaney's death.\n\nWith Kenney and Blackledge both on the roster, starting QB Steve Fuller was traded to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] on August 19. Kenney earned a Pro Bowl berth after racking up a franchise-record 4,348 passing yards, while wide receiver [[Carlos Carson]] hauled in 80 passes for 1,351 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite the team's high-flying passing game, head coach John Mackovic had trouble finding a suitable replacement for Joe Delaney and the running back position. The highest scoring contest in franchise history took place as the Chiefs and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] combined for 99 points in a wild, 51\u201348 overtime loss at the [[Kingdome]]. A meager crowd of 11,377 attended the club's season-ending 48\u201317 win against [[1983 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] on December 18, the smallest attendance figure ever for a Chiefs game at Arrowhead as the club finished the year at 6\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1984====\n{{details|1984 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nPro Bowl safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the most notable Chiefs player to defect to the rival [[United States Football League]], signing with the [[New Jersey Generals]] on February 2 after sitting out the entire 1983 campaign in a contract dispute.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Barbaro's departure and the trade of cornerback [[Gary Green (American football)|Gary Green]] began a youth movement that produced the most vaunted secondary in team history. Cornerbacks [[Kevin Ross (American football)|Kevin Ross]] and [[Albert Lewis (American football)|Albert Lewis]], and safeties [[Deron Cherry]] and [[Lloyd Burruss]] accounted for a combined 13 Pro Bowl appearances for the Chiefs<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> in the years to come.\n\nAll-America defensive tackle [[Bill Maas]] and offensive tackle [[John Alt]] were both selected in the first round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]]. Maas was named [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]], while Alt eventually became the cornerstone of the club's offensive line later in the decade. Kansas City's defense registered a team-record 11.0 sacks in a 10\u20136 win against Cleveland on September 30, coming one sack shy of the NFL single-game record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nQuarterback Bill Kenney suffered a broken thumb during the preseason and was sidelined until the season's seventh week. Second year back-up QB Todd Blackledge opened the first six contests of the season and had the club at 3\u20133. Kenney returned to the starting lineup against the [[1984 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] on October 21, but inconsistency marked the rest of the season as the club dropped four of first five contests after his return. However, the team rattled off three consecutive wins to conclude the year at 8\u20138.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1985====\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|100px|A ticket for a 1985 game between the Chiefs and the Denver Broncos]]\n{{details|1985 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a flying start in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] with a 47\u201327 win at [[1985 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], while safety [[Deron Cherry]] tied an NFL record by registering four interceptions in a 28\u20137 win against [[1985 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 29 as the club boasted a 3\u20131 record four games into the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club was then confronted with a seven-game losing streak that wasn't snapped until QB Todd Blackledge was installed as the starter against [[1985 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]] on November 24. The team rebounded to win three of its final five contests of the year with Blackledge under center, further inflaming a quarterback controversy that continued into the 1986 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOne of the few remaining bright spots in a disappointing 6\u201310 season came in the regular season finale against [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] when wide receiver [[Stephone Paige]] set an NFL record with 309 receiving yards in a 38\u201334 win, breaking the previous mark of 303 yards set by [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland's]] [[Jim Benton (American football)|Jim Benton]] in [[1945 NFL season|1945]]. Paige's mark was subsequently surpassed by a 336-yard effort by [[Flipper Anderson]] (L.A.

On the field, the pieces started coming together for head coach John Mackovic. His offense displayed plenty of scoring punch, while the club's defense and special teams became increasingly effective.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With the team sitting at 3\u20133, Bill Kenney replaced Todd Blackledge for the second half of the season in a game against San Diego,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> guiding the club to a 42\u201341 victory. That win was the first of four consecutive triumphs with Kenney at the helm, the club's longest winning streak since 1980. Poised with a 7\u20133 record after 10 games, three straight losses in November put the Chiefs playoff chances in jeopardy. Two December wins gave Kansas City a 9\u20136 mark, putting the Chiefs on the verge of their first postseason berth in 15 years.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nThe defining moment of the season came in the regular season finale at [[1986 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on December 21.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite being outgained in total yardage by a 515-to-171-yard margin, the Chiefs were able to notch a 24\u201319 victory as all of the team's points came via special teams on a blocked punt return, a field goal, a kickoff return and a blocked field goal return.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With a 10\u20136 record the Chiefs earned an AFC Wild Card berth, winning a tiebreaker with Seattle. Bill Kenney was injured in the fourth quarter of the Steelers contest, meaning Todd Blackledge would draw the starting assignment for the club's first playoff contest since 1971, a 35\u201315 loss at [[1985 New York Jets season|New York]].\n\n====1987====\n{{details|1987 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOne of the most tumultuous weeks in franchise history took place following the club's playoff loss against the Jets. Assistant head coach and special teams coach [[Frank Gansz]], resigned his position on January 7 in order to pursue opportunities as an NFL offensive coordinator.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The following day, the Chiefs announced in an impromptu press conference that John Mackovic was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 8. A popular figure among Chiefs players, Gansz was reinstated on January 10 and was named the sixth head coach in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nFormer quarterback Len Dawson became the third Chiefs player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> while injuries forced the retirement of the club's all-time leading tackler Gary Spani. A duo of rookies made a splash in a 20\u201313 win on Opening Day against San Diego as running back [[Paul Palmer (American football)|Paul Palmer]] returned a kickoff for a TD and [[Christian Okoye]] dashed for 105 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> A 24-day players strike began on September 22, effectively canceling the club's contest against [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Replacement players participated in games for the next three weeks. Much like Marv Levy five years earlier, Gansz's grip on the club's coaching reins was crippled by the labor unrest.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nKansas City's replacement squad consisted primarily of players cut in training camp. One of the few bright spots among this motley crew was running back Jitter Fields, who remained on the active roster following the strike.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs strike squad received an ominous welcome in Los Angeles when in the early morning hours of October 4, the day prior to a contest against the Raiders, an earthquake rattled [[Southern California]]. The shaken Chiefs lost a 35\u201317 decision later that day. The low point of the year came the following week at Miami in the first regular season game played at what then was known as [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. Chiefs replacement QB [[Matt Stevens (quarterback)|Matt Stevens]] was injured early in the contest, forcing into duty QB [[Alex Espinoza]], a player who had never taken an NFL snap. The result was a 42\u20130 Dolphins victory, setting the stage for an 0\u20133 performance by Kansas City's replacement unit, giving the Chiefs a 1\u20134 record before the club's regular roster returned at San Diego on October 25.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Five straight losses followed, giving the Chiefs a team-record nine-game losing skid. For the only time in team history, five different players started games at quarterback for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Behind Kenney, Kansas City won two of its last three games to conclude the [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] 4\u201311 campaign.\n\n====1988====\n{{details|1988 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe spring was marked by several notable trades as the club jockeyed to improve on its 4\u201311 finish in 1987. Todd Blackledge was traded to Pittsburgh on March 29 and 12-year veteran quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]] was acquired from Tampa Bay on March 31. The Chiefs moved up one spot in the first round of the draft to select defensive end [[Neil Smith (football player)|Neil Smith]] with the third overall pick. Bill Kenney opened the team's initial two games at quarterback, but was replaced by DeBerg for the second half against Seattle.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> DeBerg guided the team to a 20\u201313 win against [[1988 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] in his initial start as a member of the Chiefs. However, six losses and a tie followed as Kenney and DeBerg jostled for the QB job.\n\nAs the season drew to a close, it became apparent the winds of change were blowing across the organization. President Jack Steadman resigned on December 8, while general manager Jim Schaaf was relieved of his duties the same day.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Steadman was later named chairman of the board. On the field, the Chiefs finished the year at 4\u201311\u20131 as questions swirled regarding Gansz's future and who would fill the club's leadership void. One day after the season's conclusion, former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and USFL executive [[Carl Peterson]] was named the club's president/general manager and chief operating officer on December 19.\n\n==A change of face==\n\n===\"Martyball\", 1989\u20132000===\n{{Further|1989 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nAfter compiling an 8\u201322\u20131 record in two seasons, Frank Gansz was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 5, 1989. General manager Carl Peterson's selection as Gansz's successor would be former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]], who was named the seventh head coach in Chiefs history on January 24. The first draft choice of the Peterson era set the tone for the next decade as the club selected linebacker [[Derrick Thomas]] with the fourth overall selection. Thomas paired with defensive end Neil Smith to form one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in NFL history, compiling a combined 212.5 sacks during their illustrious Chiefs careers. The Peterson-Schottenheimer era got off to an inauspicious start in a 34\u201320 loss at Denver on September 10 as quarterback Steve DeBerg's first pass attempt was intercepted and returned for a TD.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club won just four times in its next 10 games as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] and [[Steve Pelluer]], who was acquired in a trade from Dallas, each opened three games apiece during that span. DeBerg regained the starting job for the final five weeks of the season, generating four wins that put the Chiefs just out of post-season qualification at 8\u20137\u20131. A 34\u20130 shutout win against Houston highlighted the club's stretch run. Running back Christian Okoye became the first Chief to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,480 yards, while Derrick Thomas won consensus NFL Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1990====\n{{Further|1990 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe foundation for the club's formidable offensive line of the 1990s gathered two key ingredients when center [[Tim Grunhard]] and guard [[Dave Szott]] were acquired in the [[1990 NFL Draft]]. Construction began on the club's indoor practice facility at the Truman Sports Complex, giving the Chiefs an 80-yard indoor field and weight room facilities upon its completion. Former defensive tackle Buck Buchanan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4. In the pre-season, The Chiefs made their initial overseas appearance, losing a 19\u20133 [[American Bowl]] decision against the [[1990 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in Berlin, Germany.

Kansas City led the NFL with a franchise-record 60.0 sacks, including a team-record 20.0 by Derrick Thomas. Thomas established an NFL single-game record with 7.0 sacks in an inspiring [[Veterans Day]] performance against [[1990 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]], a game the Seahawks miraculously won, 17\u201316, on a last-second, 25-yard TD pass to wide receiver [[Paul Skansi]]. That loss brought on the furious stretch run which saw the club record victories in six of its last seven outings. Behind DeBerg's offensive leadership (23 TD passes with just four interceptions) Kansas City finished the year with a franchise-best +26 turnover differential. The Chiefs clinched their first post-season berth since 1986 with a 24\u201321 win at San Diego and finished the year at 11\u20135, marking the franchise's best finish since 1969. The Chiefs suffered a heart-breaking, 17\u201316 loss at Miami on January 5, 1991, in an AFC Wild Card Game as placekicker Nick Lowery's potential game-winning 52-yard field goal fell short with 0:56 remaining.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1991====\n{{Further|1991 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOn July 27, former placekicker Jan Stenerud became the first of his position to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The club finished the regular season at 10\u20136, marking the first time since 1968\u201369 that the franchise had qualified for the playoffs in consecutive seasons. A 27\u201321 victory against the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in the regular season finale gave the Chiefs the right to host the Raiders just six days later in the inaugural post-season game in Arrowhead's history, and the Chiefs' first home playoff game in 20 years. Thanks to six Los Angeles turnovers, the Chiefs registered their first post-season victory since Super Bowl IV with a 10\u20136 win in an AFC Wild Card Game on December 28.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> The following week, the Chiefs lost a 37\u201314 decision at Buffalo on January 5, 1992, in an AFC Divisional Playoff match-up as the Buffalo Bills' dynamic offense proved to be too much for the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1992====\n{{Further|1992 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA longtime nemesis with Seattle, \"Plan B\" free agent quarterback [[Dave Krieg]] was signed as the club's starter on March 19. A melancholy off-season awaited the Chiefs, who mourned the passing of Player Personnel Director Whitey Dovell on May 22 and Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan on July 16. Both Dovell and Buchanan lost courageous battles with cancer. Six-time Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry announced his retirement in July after registering 50 interceptions in 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs retired the jerseys of former players Buck Buchanan (#86), Willie Lanier (#63) and Jan Stenerud (#3) in a ceremony prior to a pre-season contest against Buffalo.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nFirst-round draft pick, cornerback [[Dale Carter]] won the Bert Bell Trophy as the NFL's Rookie of the Year. The very first time Carter touched the ball in an NFL contest, he registered a 46-yard punt return touchdown in a 24\u201310 win at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 6. Running back Christian Okoye surpassed Ed Podolak as the all-time leading rusher in team history against [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 13. Injuries eventually made the 1992 campaign Okoye's last with the Chiefs after he compiled 4,897 rushing yards with the franchise. The club got off to a 3\u20131 start, but was faced with a 4\u20134 record at the season's midpoint. Despite four consecutive victories, the club's post-season hopes still came down to the season's final contest. Owning a 9\u20136 record and needing one more victory to secure a playoff berth, the Chiefs defense tallied three touchdowns, while Dave Krieg tossed a pair of scoring passes as Kansas City claimed a 42\u201320 win against Denver to finish the season at 10\u20136. Despite the big win against [[1992 Denver Broncos season|Denver]], the Chiefs made a quick exit from the playoffs as Krieg was sacked 7 times in a 17\u20130 AFC Wild Card loss at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on January 2, 1993.\n\n====1993====\n{{Further|1993 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs spent the off-season installing the \"[[West Coast offense]]\" under the direction of new offensive coordinator [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]], who at one time served as quarterbacks coach to [[Joe Montana]] in San Francisco. On April 20, the Chiefs traded for Joe Montana, who directed the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories in the previous decade. Guard [[Will Shields]] was selected with the club's third-round draft choice, rounding out the \"law firm\" of Grunhard, Szott and Shields which anchored the interior of Chiefs offensive line for most of the decade.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn June 9, the club signed unrestricted free agent running back [[Marcus Allen]], who had spent 11 seasons tormenting the Chiefs as a member of the rival Los Angeles Raiders. Montana and Allen made their debuts in a 27\u20133 win at [[1993 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on September 5, marking Montana's first Opening Day appearance since 1990. Shields initiated a franchise-record streak of 175 consecutive starts the following week at [[1993 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Thanks to a pair of ''Monday Night Football'' wins at Arrowhead, the club owned a 6\u20132 mid-season record. Before taking the field in a Sunday night contest at [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on December 26, the team learned it had clinched its first AFC West title since 1971 thanks to a [[1993 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] loss earlier in the day. The team finished the season with an 11\u20135 regular season record, marking the club's fourth consecutive year with a double-digit victory tally. Linebacker Derrick Thomas was named the NFL's Man of the Year following the season. Thomas, who founded \"The Third and Long Foundation\", received the honor in large part due to his efforts in promoting children's literacy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nKansas City got its first true taste of \"Montana Magic\" as the Hall of Fame passer engineered a brilliant comeback in a 27\u201324 OT win in an AFC Wild Card thriller against [[1993 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on January 8, 1994. Next, the Chiefs traveled to the [[Astrodome]] to face the red-hot Oilers, who had won 11 straight games to conclude the regular season. The heavily favored Oilers opened up a 13\u20137 lead in the fourth quarter, but once again, Montana conjured a comeback, guiding the club to a 28\u201320 victory. The Chiefs playoff journey ended as the club made its initial [[AFC Championship Game]] appearance at Buffalo on January 23. Montana was knocked out of the contest early in the second half as Buffalo claimed its record fourth straight AFC title by a score of 30\u201313.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1994====\n{{Further|1994 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nWhile the previous off-season saw the Chiefs stockpile several key free agents, a number of familiar faces departed following the 1993 season, most notably cornerbacks Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross, as well as placekicker Nick Lowery. Quarterback [[Steve Bono]] was acquired in a trade with San Francisco on May 2 to serve as Joe Montana's backup, a job he previously held when both were with the 49ers. A grass playing field was installed at Arrowhead Stadium, replacing the previous [[AstroTurf]] surface. The club made its second American Bowl appearance in the pre-season, meeting [[1994 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn September 11, [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] came to Arrowhead to play against Joe Montana and the Chiefs in a highly anticipated matchup. The Chiefs prevailed over the 49ers and Montana's successor by a 24\u201317 count before a crowd of 79,907, the second-largest \"in-house\" attendance in Arrowhead history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After starting the season 3\u20130, the Chiefs dropped back-to-back games before snapping an 11-game losing streak against [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at Mile High Stadium on October 17 in a memorable Monday night contest. Montana orchestrated a masterful comeback, connecting with WR Willie Davis for a five-yard TD with 0:08 remaining to give the Chiefs a 31\u201328 triumph. A late-season, three-game losing skid put the club's playoff hopes in jeopardy. The Chiefs found themselves at 8\u20137 faced with a do-or-die regular season finale against the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] in the final NFL contest (to date) played at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] and in Los Angeles until 2016.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Marcus Allen had his finest game as a Chief, ironically against his former team, rushing 33 times for 132 yards en route to a 19\u20139 win. At 9\u20137, Kansas City qualified for the playoffs for a fifth straight season. However, the Chiefs made a rapid departure from the playoffs in Montana's final professional contest at Miami on [[New Year's Eve]]. Montana and Dolphins' quarterback Dan Marino conducted a masterful first-half duel that ended deadlocked at 17\u201317, but [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] eventually prevailed by a 27\u201317 count.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1995====\n{{Further|1995 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nJoe Montana announced his retirement from football after 16 years in the NFL on April 18 and Steve Bono was promoted to the starting job. Immediately, so-called media experts predicted much gloom and doom for the 1995 Chiefs under Bono, leading Schottenheimer to quip during training camp that his club had been picked \"sixth in a five-team division.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Led by Bono, who merited a Pro Bowl berth, Kansas City posted an NFL-best 13\u20133 record with unblemished 8\u20130 marks in the AFC West and at Arrowhead. The Chiefs led the NFL in rushing offense (138.9 ypg), scoring defense (15.1 ppg) and turnover ratio (+12). A 24\u20133 win at Arizona on October 1 featured a surreal, 76-yard TD run on a bootleg by Bono as the Chiefs initiated a seven-game winning streak, the franchise's longest since 1969. In a ''Monday Night Football'' classic against [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on October 9, wide receiver [[Tamarick Vanover]] returned a punt for an 86-yard TD to provide the winning points in a 29\u201323 victory, the team's third straight home win in overtime.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThe club's defense began to flex its muscle, beginning with a 21\u20137 win at Denver on October 22. The contest, played in a Rocky Mountain snowstorm, featured the 100th rushing TD of Marcus Allen's career. The Chiefs won a home game for the third time on a last-second return score that concluded in Arrowhead's west end zone when cornerback [[Mark Collins (American football)|Mark Collins]] scooped up a fumble for a 20\u201313 win against [[1995 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Kansas City clinched a division title with a 29\u201323 victory at [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on December 3 en route to a franchise-best 13\u20133 regular season record and a team-record sixth consecutive postseason berth. The Chiefs were represented by seven players in the Pro Bowl, more than any other AFC team.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> In the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the underdog [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] on January 7\u2014a blustery afternoon with the temperature at 11 degrees and a wind chill of \u22129. Three interceptions and three missed field goals from placekicker [[Lin Elliot]] contributed to the 10\u20137 loss at Arrowhead.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1996====\n{{Further|1996 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City entered the 1996 campaign with essentially the same lineup as the club boasted in 1995 and were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' along with Green Bay as pre-season Super Bowl favorites. Kansas City made its third American Bowl appearance, this time against [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. The club started the season with a 4\u20130 record for the first time in team history, but the season's lofty expectations came crashing down as the squad lost three of its next four games. A three-game winning streak, including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl champion]] [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], put the club back in post-season contention at 8\u20133.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThat rosy picture quickly crumbled in a 28\u201314 loss against San Diego on November 24 as Steve Bono was relieved in the second half by back-up quarterback [[Rich Gannon]]. Gannon assumed the starting reins for a 28\u201324 win in a Thanksgiving Day game at [[1996 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] as Marcus Allen registered his 111th career rushing TD to surpass [[Walter Payton]] as the NFL's all-time leader in that department, a mark that was later broken by [[Emmitt Smith]]. Needing just one more win to qualify for the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped their next two games as an injury-hampered Gannon was sidelined for good in the second quarter of a 24\u201319 loss against [[1996 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]]. Faced with a must-win situation in a frigid regular season finale at Buffalo, the club's post-season hopes hinged on Bono. Despite a 20\u20139 loss to the [[1996 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]], the Chiefs still had a shot to slip into the playoffs if Atlanta could secure a win at Jacksonville. However, Atlanta placekicker [[Morten Andersen]]'s 30-yard field goal attempt went wide left with 0:04 remaining, preserving a 19\u201317 win and the AFC's final Wild Card spot for the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], who won a tiebreaker with Kansas City. The Chiefs finished with a 9\u20137 record, missing the postseason for the first time since 1989.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1997====\n{{Further|1997 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City dramatically retooled its roster in 1997, beginning with the signing of free agent quarterback Elvis Grbac on March 17. In addition to Grbac, the Chiefs lineup featured 11 new starters, including wide receiver [[Andre Rison]], who won team MVP honors after becoming the club's first Pro Bowl receiver in a decade. On defense, the club's top four picks from the 1996 Draft, safeties [[Jerome Woods]] and [[Reggie Tongue]], defensive end [[John Browning (American football)|John Browning]] and linebacker [[Donnie Edwards]], all emerged as starters.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nTackle [[John Alt]] announced his retirement at training camp in River Falls, Wisconsin on July 21. All the new faces quickly formed a cohesive unit as the Chiefs posted a 13\u20133 record, an 8\u20130 Arrowhead record and their second AFC West title in three years. The club engineered several dramatic finishes, the first of which came in a ''Monday Night Football'' thriller at Oakland on September 8 when Elvis Grbac connected with Andre Rison on an improbable 32-yard TD pass with just 0:03 remaining to cap a 28\u201327 win. Six days later, Kansas City's defense produced a remarkable goal-line stand to preserve a 22\u201316 victory at Arrowhead vs. [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After posting a 6\u20132 record during the season's first half, Kansas City's good fortune appeared to run out against Pittsburgh when Grbac suffered a broken clavicle. However, Rich Gannon led the team to a 5\u20131 mark in their next six outings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nPlacekicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]] provided one of the year's most memorable moments, connecting on a line-drive 54-yard field as time expired to give Kansas City a 24\u201322 win against Denver on November 16. [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] entered Arrowhead boasting an 11-game winning streak, the team departed after suffering a 44\u20139 defeat. The Chiefs' vaunted defensive unit pitched a 30\u20130 shutout vs. Oakland on December 7. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring defense, allowing a mere 14.5 points per game. The 232 total points permitted by the Chiefs in 1997 were the lowest tally ever allowed in a 16-game season in team history. Kansas City also broke a 63-year-old mark owned by the [[1934 NFL season|1934]] [[1934 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] by not permitting a second-half TD in 10 consecutive games. Grbac returned for the regular season finale against [[1997 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]] on December 21 as the squad finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history.\n\nThe Chiefs' 13\u20133 record gave them home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs. However, their playoff run was short-lived, as Kansas City lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 14\u201310 in the Divisional round.\n\n====1998====\n{{details|1998 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7\u20139 in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching (\"[[Martyball]]\"), and resigned following the 1998 season.\n\n====1999====\n{{details|topic=1999 Kansas City Chiefs season|1999 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nSchottenheimer left as head coach, replaced by his defensive coach [[Gunther Cunningham]]. In two years, Cunningham showed little improvement, going 9\u20137 and 7\u20139. After the loss of [[Derrick Thomas]], the collapse of the defense was unmistakable. The Chiefs' wins were mostly made by a high scoring offense rather than a powerful defense.\n\n==The Chiefs in the 21st century==\n\n===An explosive offense, 2001\u20132005===\n\n====2001====\n{{details|topic=2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|2001 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAfter coaching the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Rams]] to the [[Super Bowl]] and retiring, [[Dick Vermeil]] was lured out of retirement and took over as head coach in [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. It was noted that Vermeil would have the team ready for the Super Bowl \"within three years\", while in fact Vermeil would stay in Kansas City for the next five.\n\nThe first move the team made was forced after quarterback Elvis Grbac voided his contract, forgoing an $11 million bonus, leaving to lead the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl champion]] [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Vermeil replaced him with his primary pick for the Rams' quarterback, [[Trent Green]].\n\nAnother notable replacement was [[Priest Holmes]] at running back, who had served as back-up to Baltimore's [[Jamal Lewis]] in their Super Bowl season. Additions to the offensive line, including left tackle [[Willie Roaf]] from New Orleans, [[Casey Wiegmann]] at center, Brian Waters at guard, and [[John Welbourn]] from Philadelphia helped create the Chiefs' high powered offense. Holmes would go on to break [[Marshall Faulk]]'s record of 26 touchdowns in a season on December 27, 2003.\n\nVermeil brought many elements of \"[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\" from St. Louis to Kansas City's own offense, but much like the Schottenheimer era in the 1990s, the offense didn't win any playoff games.\n\n====2003====\n{{Main|2003 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs went 13\u20133 in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and their offense, considered by many as one of the most powerful of all time, helped make Kansas City again a favorite to win [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. After starting 9\u20130, the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in their tenth game following a \"guarantee\" by Bengals wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]]. The Chiefs' dream season of 2003 began to lose momentum by November, but they still managed to gain the number two seed in the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|2004 playoffs]]. The mighty homefield advantage of Arrowhead Stadium and their high-powered offense wouldn't lead the Chiefs to glory and the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoffs in an offensive shootout in which neither team punted, an NFL playoffs first. The Chiefs' defense came under fire immediately after the loss, and [[Greg Robinson (American football coach)|Greg Robinson]], the team's defensive coordinator, resigned after the season.\n\n====2004====\n{{Main|2004 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAs with the loss to the Broncos in 1997, this loss led to a poor following season. The Chiefs managed to finish the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 7\u20139 record. In 2004, Gunther Cunningham was brought back as the defensive coordinator. However, the defense showed little improvement. The offense, unable to record the same high scores as the previous year, was unable to bring in the wins as they had the previous year.\n\n[[File:Larry_Johnson_Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|Running back [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]]]]\n====2005====\n{{Main|2005 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nFor their 2005 campaign, the Chiefs brought in several new players to boost a defense that had finished among the worst units the past three years. The year also saw [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] start at running back in place of an injured [[Priest Holmes]]. But despite winning ten games, the Chiefs became just the fourth team in NFL history to go 10\u20136 and not reach the playoffs.\n\n===Rebuilding a contender, 2006\u20132012===\n\n====2006====\n{{Main|2006 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA tearful head coach [[Dick Vermeil]] announced his retirement before the final game of the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|2005 season]]. Within two weeks, then-[[New York Jets]] head coach [[Herman Edwards]] had signed a new 4-year contract to coach the Chiefs. The 2006 Chiefs returned to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, only to lose 23\u20138 in the Wild Card round against their playoff nemesis, the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs owner and founder [[Lamar Hunt]] died on December 13, 2006, due to complications brought on by a ten-year battle with [[prostate cancer]]. Hunt was remembered throughout the remainder of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] all throughout the NFL with moments of silence and ceremonies in Kansas City. Hunt's four children inherited ownership of the Chiefs. His oldest son, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], became chairman and CEO of the Chiefs, and the public face of the ownership group. He represents the Chiefs at owner meetings, and has the final say in team operations.\n[[File:Tony_Gonzalez_at_2005_Pro_Bowl_050213-N-3019M-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in 2005]]\n====2007====\n{{Main|2007 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs' 2007 off-season began with turmoil over the contract of [[Tony Gonzalez]], and the long-term career of [[Trent Green]] in Kansas City. Backup quarterback [[Damon Huard]] was signed to a three-year contract in February and Green was not only asked to restructure his contract but offered in trades to other teams.\n\nOn June 5, the Chiefs agreed to trade Green to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for a conditional fifth round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], pending a physical from Green.<ref name=\"Green goes to Dolphins\">Pasquarelli, Len.

Five different running backs were used after [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] was injured in week 9 against [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. The team also had no stability at quarterback with Huard and [[Brodie Croyle]], while their offensive line depleted in the absence of their former Pro Bowl guard [[Will Shields]].\n\nThe season ended with a nine-game losing streak, the team's first since [[1987 Kansas City Chiefs season|1987]], and a 4\u201312 record. It was the Chiefs' first season with 12 losses since [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]].\n\nHead coach Herman Edwards continued to build upon the Chiefs' roster with young players, mostly on defense, and attempted stabilize a once record-setting offensive line.<ref name=\"Transition\"/> The Chiefs continue to rebuild a defense that may quietly creep its way back to respectability.<ref name=\"Transition\">Teicher, Adam.

Other than that, there was little else of note about the season, which saw Kansas City fall to a franchise-worst 2\u201314 record.\n\nDuring the next offseason, the team made news by acquiring quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] (who had filled in for Brady during the previous year) and veteran linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] from New England for a second-round draft pick, which was used to obtain LSU defensive end [[Tyson Jackson]]. The Chiefs were also awarded the 256th and last player in the draft for the first time since 1970, South Carolina kicker [[Ryan Succop]]. Also, [[Scott Pioli]] was hired as general manager, yet another acquisition from New England.\n\nThere was little apparent sign of improvement as the Chiefs began 2009 by losing five games in a row before a victory over the Washington Redskins in Week 6. However, the team did manage to inflict an overtime defeat on the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 11, and closed out the year with a 4\u201312 record by overpowering Denver and preventing the Broncos from going to the playoffs. In that game, second-year running back [[Jamaal Charles]] set a franchise record by rushing for 259 yards.\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a 3\u20130 start in 2010, first by beating San Diego 21\u201314 on ''Monday Night Football''. This was their first MNF win in a decade, in addition to their first home win over the Chargers since 2006. They followed up the next week with a 16\u201314 win in Cleveland, followed by a 31\u201310 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers at home. The Chiefs entered their bye week as the only remaining undefeated team, but as most experts predicted, fell to Indianapolis 19\u20139 in Week 5. They lost a close game with the Houston Texans (35\u201331) in Week 6, beat Jacksonville in Week 7, and then won a razor-thin game against the winless Buffalo Bills. After going into overtime with a 10\u201310 score, neither team was able to score anything until Ryan Succop kicked a 35-yard field goal just as the clock reached 0:00 and avoiding a tie. Then came losses to Oakland and Denver, three straight wins over Seattle, Arizona, and Denver, a loss in San Diego, and wins over St. Louis and Tennessee. Losing the final game at home versus Oakland, the Chiefs finished 10\u20136 and won their first division title since 2003. However, the team's lack of postseason experience showed up as they were buried 30\u20137 by the Baltimore Ravens in the wild card round of the playoffs.\n\nKansas City began 2011 by losing its first three games, including blowout losses at home against Buffalo and at Detroit, where the Chiefs lost Jamaal Charles for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL. However, the Chiefs were able to rebound from the slow start, winning their next four contests, including a thrilling overtime victory over San Diego on ''Monday Night Football''. Unfortunately, the Chiefs would lose all momentum the following week when they were stunned at Arrowhead by the winless Miami Dolphins, losing quarterback Matt Cassel for the season with a hand injury. After losing four of the next five, the Chiefs fired head coach Todd Haley less than one year removed from a division title. With interim head coach [[Romeo Crennel]] and recently acquired quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] at the helm, the Chiefs were able to knock off then-undefeated Green Bay, and at 6\u20138, still had a shot at the division crown. The Chiefs would fall just short, however, losing 16\u201313 in overtime to arch-rival Oakland. The Chiefs would finish the 2011 season with a road win versus eventual AFC West champion Denver, finishing the season at 7\u20139.\n\nThe Chiefs hit rock bottom in 2012, with a passing game that was one of the worst of all time. Cassel was benched twice in favor of [[Brady Quinn]], but neither quarterback could perform well enough to win more than one game each. Despite having a roster that produced five Pro Bowlers and a 1,500-yard rushing season from Charles, the Chiefs stumbled to a 1\u20139 record.\n\nKansas City's 2012 season took a tragic and bizarre turn on December 1 when linebacker [[Jovan Belcher]] murdered his girlfriend in an argument. He then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he got into a confrontation with Crennel and several other Chiefs employees in the parking lot. They attempted to calm him down, after which Belcher thanked them and immediately shot himself dead.\n\nWith the team scheduled to play against Carolina the next day, there was considerable controversy as to whether the game should go on, but in the end it was decided not to move or cancel it. In a half-empty stadium, the Chiefs won the emotional match 27\u201321.\n\nAfter the Chiefs' victory over Carolina, the team did not win again in the 2012 season, only averaging 5.75 points per game in their final four games,<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/2012.htm</ref> and finished the season on a four-game losing streak and with a 2\u201314 record on the season.\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, both head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager [[Scott Pioli]] were fired from their positions. On January 4, the Chiefs signed former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] head coach [[Andy Reid]], who had been fired after coaching the Eagles for the past fourteen years, and on January 13 of the same year the Chiefs hired [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] to be their general manager.\n\n===The Andy Reid era, 2013\u2013present===\n\n====2013====\n\n{{details|2013 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, due to their 2\u201314 record in the season prior, received the #1 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], which was the first time in franchise history that team had the #1 pick in the NFL Draft that was not acquired in a transaction. However, about eight weeks prior to their first selection in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Chiefs traded for quarterback [[Alex Smith]], who the year prior had been benched in favor of [[Colin Kaepernick]] on the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Chiefs were able to acquire Smith by trading their second round picks in 2013 and 2014. While this move did end up bringing the quarterback for the Chiefs for the next five years to Kansas City, the selection was only supported by a plurality of Chiefs fans<ref>http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2013/2/27/4036414/alex-smith-trade-approval-poll-chiefs-trade-49ers</ref> at the time of the trade. After an offseason that brought players such as [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]] and [[Geoff Schwartz]], the Chiefs selected [[Eric Fisher (American football)|Eric Fisher]] with the first pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, as well as selecting future four time Pro Bowler [[Travis Kelce]] in the third round of the same draft. In the 2013 season, the Chiefs started the season with an incredible start, tying the 2003 team as the best start in franchise history and being the last team undefeated in the 2013 season, starting out with a 9\u20130 record. However, due a more difficult second half of the Chiefs schedule and somewhat of a regression by the Chiefs defense, the team faltered down the stretch, going 2\u20135 in their final seven games.\n\nEven though the team struggled near the end of the season, the Chiefs still clinched a playoff berth as a wildcard and played the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the first round of the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs]]. It seemed that the Chiefs would be able to win their first playoff game in twenty years and go on to the Divisional Round, but even though the Chiefs took a 38\u201310 lead in the early portion of the third quarter, the Chiefs were unable to contain the Colts offense and lost the game by only one point, 45\u201344.<ref>https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2014/1/4/5274372/chiefs-colts-final-score-kc-blows-28-point-lead-lose-in-wild-card</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric_Berry.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Safety [[Eric Berry]] was an integral part of the Chiefs defense in the 2010s]]\n====2014====\n\n{{details|2014 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2014 season, the Chiefs had the twenty-second pick in the [[2014 NFL Draft]], and selected linebacker [[Dee Ford]] out of Alabama, as well as future starting right guard [[Laurent Duvernay-Tardif]] with the 200th pick of the same draft.\n\nUnlike the 2013 season, the Chiefs were unable to get out to a good start on the year, as the Chiefs lost their first two and three out of their first five games. However, after a bye week in week 6, the Chiefs went on a tear, as they won their next five games, dominating the St. Louis Rams and the New York Jets, as well as beating the eventual Super Bowl participant Seattle Seahawks to put the team at a 7\u20133 record after ten games.\n\nHowever, disaster struck as the team suffered a devastating loss to the winless 0\u201310 [[Oakland Raiders]], who were able to upset the Chiefs on [[Thursday Night Football]]. This led to a three-game losing streak, which put the Chiefs at 7\u20136 on the season and desperately needing to win out for a chance to play in the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. This did not occur, as the Chiefs lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in Week 16 and eventually missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record.\n\n====2015====\n\n{{details|2015 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2015 season, the Chiefs had the eighteenth pick in the [[2015 NFL Draft]], and selected cornerback [[Marcus Peters]] out of Washington, who would become the eventual Defensive Rookie of the Year and a two time Pro Bowler for the Kansas City Chiefs. In the same draft, the Chiefs also selected future starters such as [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], and [[Steven Nelson]].\n\nWhile the Chiefs were able to win their first game against the [[Houston Texans]] and in their second game of the season, they held a 24\u201317 lead with only two minutes to play against the [[Denver Broncos]], who had won the past four [[AFC West]] championships, the Chiefs allowed a touchdown and then fumbled with less than thirty seconds remaining, sealing a victory for the Broncos. This loss was the first of five consecutive losses, and the team seemed to be spiraling out of control with a record of 1\u20135.\n\nThankfully for the Chiefs, the team overall began to play better and began an extremely improbable eleven game winning streak, beating the eventual Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos in their third game of the streak, and this streak was able to give the Chiefs the push they needed to make the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs]], as they clinched in Week 16, and even had a chance to win the AFC West in Week 17 if the Broncos lost and the Chiefs won. While the Chiefs were able to beat the [[Oakland Raiders]] and uphold their end of the scenario, the [[San Diego Chargers]] fell short and were unable to beat the Denver Broncos, and the Broncos clinched the division and home-field throughout the AFC Playoffs.\n\nIn the Chiefs first game of the postseason, they matched up against the 9\u20137 Houston Texans, and after a 22-year drought, the Chiefs were finally able to win a playoff game as the Chiefs walloped the Texans 30\u20130. This victory was the first time the Chiefs had won a playoff game since 1993, and gave the Chiefs the chance to make the AFC Championship Game for only the second time in team history, if they could beat the [[New England Patriots]] on the road. The Chiefs were unable to beat the Patriots, as injuries and losing the turnover battle sealed the loss for the Chiefs, and they were unable to beat the Patriots and lost 27\u201320 in the divisional round.\n \nOne notable achievement during this season was the first award given to the Chiefs in the Andy Reid era, as Marcus Peters won the Defensive Rookie of the Year award, and Eric Berry also won the Comeback Player of the Year award after beating his battle with cancer and playing well with the Chiefs in his first year after his treatment.\n\n====2016====\n\n{{details|2016 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2016 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs traded back out of the first round and instead drafted with the 37th pick in the draft, and used this selection to draft [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)|Chris Jones]]. As well as drafting Chris Jones, the Chiefs selected eventual three-time Pro Bowler [[Tyreek Hill]] in the fifth round of the same draft.\n\nThe Chiefs start to the season was no more than mediocre, and the before their bye week the Chiefs were destroyed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 43\u201314, which put the Chiefs on 2\u20132 for the year. After the bye week, however, the Chiefs won their next five games and were sitting at 7\u20132 on the season until an upset occurred as the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were able to eek out a two-point victory against the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], as the Bucs won 19\u201317. The Chiefs experienced an almost identical game against another team that missed the postseason, losing 19\u201317 to the [[Tennessee Titans]] at home. This loss put the Chiefs at 10\u20134 and the dream of a division title was in jeopardy. Heading into Week 17, the Chiefs were 11\u20134 and their rival, the [[Oakland Raiders]], were 12\u20133 but the Raiders did not have the tiebreaker on the Chiefs. In order for the Chiefs to clinch the division, similar to the 2015 season, the Chiefs needed a win and the division leader to lose. Unlike 2015, however, the division leader lost as the Oakland Raiders were unable to start their quarterback, [[Derek Carr]] due to an injury and the Raiders lost to the Broncos. The Chiefs were able to pick up a crucial victory over the [[San Diego Chargers]] (which would also be their final game in San Diego) and clinch the division and a first-round bye.\n\nHeading into the [[2016-17 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were 12\u20134 and claimed the second seed in the AFC. After the Pittsburgh Steelers were able to defeat the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wildcard Round, it was confirmed that the Chiefs would have to play the same team that beat them by 29 points fifteen weeks prior. While the Chiefs were able to hold Pittsburgh from scoring any touchdowns in their divisional round game, the Chiefs were only able to put up sixteen points of offense and the Steelers' six field goals were enough to put the Steelers into the AFC Championship Game and once again give a devastating playoff loss to the franchise.\n\n====2017====\n\n{{details|2017 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2017 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs decided to trade up into the draft, giving up their first round selections in 2017 and 2018 as well as their third round pick in 2017 in order to move up to #10 in the draft. With this selection, the Chiefs selected [[Patrick Mahomes]], their first quarterback drafted in the first round since 1983. While Mahomes would only start one game in the 2017 season, he was pegged to become the future of the franchise as the Chiefs had to trade a significant amount of draft capital in order to secure the quarterback. As well, during the offseason [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] was fired and [[Brett Veach]] was promoted to become the Chiefs next general manager.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to start the season strong, and after five games the Chiefs were 5\u20130 on the season. However, the Chiefs were unable to keep the winning streak alive and instead started a streak in the other direction, losing six of seven and four in a row. This put the Chiefs at 6\u20136 on the season and they desperately needed a win against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] to put themselves in a good position to win back to back AFC West titles. The Chiefs were able to beat the Chargers and move to 7\u20136. The Chiefs were able to win their next two games and clinch the [[AFC West]] in Week 16, which was the first time in team history that they had won consecutive division titles. With the Chiefs being locked into the #4 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs rested most of their starters and Patrick Mahomes started his first game of his career. While his numbers were not incredibly impressive, he showed raw talent with several impressive throws. He was also able to win this game, and the Chiefs finished the year at 10\u20136 and with the #4 seed in the AFC.\n\nIn the [[2017\u201318 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were matched up with the 9\u20137 [[Tennessee Titans]], led by [[Marcus Mariota]]. The Chiefs were able to get out to an early 21\u20133 lead, but the offense and defense faltered down the stretch and the Chiefs lost another close playoff game as the final score was 22\u201321 Titans. One bright spot for the team was rookie sensation [[Kareem Hunt]], who led the NFL in rushing yards and was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as being named Co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, along with [[Alvin Kamara]].\n\n[[File:Patrick Mahomes II.JPG|right|thumb|Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs starting quarterback since 2018, has broken numerous passing records and garnered an MVP award]]\n====2018====\n\n{{details|2018 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the same month as the playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans, a trade was announced between the Chiefs and the [[Washington Redskins]], and after five years of starting at least fifteen games in each year, [[Alex Smith]] was traded to the Redskins. In return, the Chiefs received [[Kendall Fuller]] and a third-round pick.\n\nIn the [[2018 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs did not have a first-round selection due to their trade to acquire the selection to draft [[Patrick Mahomes]], but they traded up to select [[Breeland Speaks]] in the second round of the NFL Draft. This draft also demonstrated the emphasis on improving the defense as the Chiefs only selected defensive players in the draft.\n\nIdentically to 2017, the Chiefs started out the season 5\u20130 and then lost their following game to an AFC juggernaut, this time to the [[New England Patriots]] in primetime. During this stretch, Patrick Mahomes threw ten touchdown passes in his first two games and four more over the next three. This was the start of an incredible campaign for the 23-year-old, as he finished the season with over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, being the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat, only behind [[Peyton Manning]]. After the Chiefs fell to the Patriots, they then won their next four to sit at 9\u20131 heading into their game against the also 9\u20131 [[Los Angeles Rams]]. While Patrick Mahomes threw six touchdown passes and led his team to over 50 points, he also had five turnovers and the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to lose a game while also scoring 50 points or more, as the Chiefs lost 54\u201351. The Chiefs then won their next two games to clinch a playoff berth in Week 14 as they were able to beat the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in overtime and sit at 11\u20132 on the season. Only needing a victory to secure a first-round bye and a third consecutive [[AFC West]] title, the Chiefs fell short against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and fell to 11\u20133 on the season as they lost 29\u201328. After the Chargers lost the following Saturday to the Baltimore Ravens and the [[Houston Texans]] lost to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the Chiefs only needed to beat the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC and an AFC West title. The Chiefs, however, fell short and lost 38\u201331. Now sitting at 11\u20134 and only needing to beat the Oakland Raiders to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC but also having the risk of falling all the way to the #5 seed, the Chiefs walloped the 4\u201311 [[Oakland Raiders]] 35\u20133, and clinched their third consecutive AFC West title and the #1 seed in the AFC for the first time since 1997.\n\nHeading into the [[2018\u201319 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were sitting at 12\u20134 and were the #1 seed in the AFC. After the Indianapolis Colts were able to beat the Houston Texans on the road, the Colts came to Kansas City to play the Chiefs in a divisional round matchup. The Colts to this point were 4\u20130 against the Chiefs in the playoffs and had given them plenty of trouble in the past. However, the Chiefs continued their stellar season with an impressive victory over the Colts, as the Chiefs won 31\u201313 and did not falter down the stretch like some of their previous postseason games in the Andy Reid era. This win came on a combination of four rushing touchdowns and a defense that only allowed six points, as the other seven came on a blocked punt that was recovered for a touchdown. With this victory, the Chiefs were able to host the [[AFC Championship Game]] for the first time in team history, and this was the first time ever that Kansas City had hosted a conference championship or a championship game in the AFL or NFL. After the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers, the matchup was set: Patriots at Chiefs for the AFC Championship.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs started out slow and were shut out in the first half, and the Patriots were leading 14\u20130. By the fourth quarter, however, the Chiefs were winning 21\u201317. The teams traded blows during the fourth quarter, where the two teams combined to score 38 points in the quarter. Down 31\u201328 with one timeout and only thirty-nine seconds to go, the Chiefs were able to drive down the field and kick a field goal to send the game into overtime. However, the Chiefs did not win the coin toss and the Patriots received the ball to begin overtime. The Chiefs were able to get the Patriots into three 3rd down and 10 to go situations, however the Patriots converted on all of them and eventually scored a touchdown to win the game by a score of 37\u201331. It was the third consecutive year where the Chiefs had lost a playoff game by six points or less.\n\nThe 2018 Chiefs also became the first team in NFL history to score at least 26 points in all of their games.\n\n====2019====\n{{details|2019 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nHeading into the 2019 offseason, the Chiefs had many key players that they cut, traded, or allowed to become free agents. Some of these players included [[Dee Ford]] (traded after being franchise tagged), [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], Allen Bailey, Justin Houston, Eric Berry, and more. The Chiefs also had to find a new defensive coordinator after the firing of [[Bob Sutton (American football)|Bob Sutton]] following the collapse against New England in the AFC Championship game. The Chiefs would hire [[Steve Spagnuolo]] as their defensive coordinator on January 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001013167/article/chiefs-hire-steve-spagnuolo-as-defensive-coordinator|title=Chiefs hire Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=January 24, 2019|accessdate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKansas City enjoyed a 4\u20130 start before losing to the [[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]].

The Chiefs ultimately won 35\u201324, avenging another regular season loss and clinching their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/afc-championship-2020-patrick-mahomes-helps-end-50-year-super-bowl-drought-for-chiefs-and-their-fans/ |title=AFC Championship 2020: Patrick Mahomes helps end 50-year Super Bowl drought for Chiefs and their fans |last=Dodd |first=Dennis |date=2020-01-19 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Chiefs quarterbacks==\n{{details|Kansas City Chiefs quarterbacks}}\nThroughout the Chiefs' near five-decade existence, there have been 12 starting quarterbacks to lead the team.

The team was a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and now is currently part of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) (they are not associated with an earlier [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] NFL team that only played for one season in 1952).\n\nThe Texans won the AFL Championship in 1962, and the team relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the following year. In 1966, the Chiefs won their second AFL title and appeared in the [[Super Bowl I|inaugural AFL-NFL World Championship game]]. In 1969, the Chiefs won the final AFL title and went on to defeat the NFL's [[Spread betting|heavily favored]] [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[Super Bowl IV]]. The Texans/Chiefs were the most victorious franchise in AFL history, compiling an 87\u201348\u20135 record from 1960 to 1969. They won the Super Bowl in January of 1970, and February 2, 2020 at 09:12 p.m. Central.\n\n==AFL origins==\n{{details|topic=more information on the AFL's origins|American Football League}}\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]], son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]], began discussions with other businessmen in establishing an American football organization that would rival that of the [[National Football League]]. Since as early as 1958, Hunt had the interest of purchasing an NFL franchise and moving them to [[Dallas, Texas]]. His desire to secure a professional football franchise was further heightened after watching the historic [[1958 NFL Championship Game]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. The team that Hunt was most interested in buying was the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ Kansas City Chiefs History AFL Origins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |date=2007-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe NFL convinced Hunt to contact Cardinals owner [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner]], and her husband Walter Wolfner eventually agreed to sell Hunt 20 percent of the Cardinals franchise. Hunt declined the opportunity. He then conceived the concept of forming a second league. \"Why wouldn't a second league work\", Hunt recalled. \"There was an [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] in baseball, why not football?\" Hunt contacted several other individuals who had expressed interest in the Cardinals franchise\u2014[[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], [[Max Winter]] and Bill Boyer\u2014and gauged their interest in forming a second league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nOn August 14, the first meeting of the new league was held in [[Chicago]]. Charter memberships were issued to six original cities \u2014 Dallas, [[New York Jets|New York]], [[Houston Oilers|Houston]], [[Denver Broncos|Denver]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]] and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minneapolis]]. The league was officially christened the American Football League on August 22. [[Ralph Wilson]] was extended the league's [[Buffalo Bills|seventh franchise]] on October 28 and [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] became the league's [[New England Patriots|eighth team]]'s owner on November 22. Minneapolis withdrew its franchise from the AFL in November after receiving an offer for a team in the NFL,<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/> and [[Oakland, California]] instead joined the AFL as the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n===Early years in Dallas===\n[[File:Swink fleer 1960.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Jim Swink]] on a [[Fleer]] [[American Football Card|football card]] of 1960]]\nFor the [[1960 Dallas Texans season|Texans' inaugural season]], team owner Lamar Hunt pursued both legendary [[University of Oklahoma]] coach [[Bud Wilkinson]] and [[New York Giants]] defensive assistant [[Tom Landry]] to lead his Texans franchise. Wilkinson opted to stay at Oklahoma, while Landry was destined to coach the NFL's franchise in Dallas. In mid-December 1959 Hunt settled on a relatively unknown assistant coach from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], [[Hank Stram]]. \"One of the biggest reasons I hired Hank was that he really wanted the job\", Hunt explained. \"It turned out to be a very lucky selection on my part.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nThe Texans were very fortunate to have [[Don Klosterman (American football)|Don Klosterman]] as their head talent man. Klosterman had a penchant for luring star talent away from the NFL, and for finding talent otherwise undiscovered.\n\nReserved seats at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] cost [[United States Dollars|USD $4]], general admission $2 and high school students paid 90\u00a2 (90 cents) that initial season. [[Don Rossi]] served as the team's [[General Manager (American football)|General Manager]] until November when he was succeeded by [[Jack Steadman]]. The team was headquartered in the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. The AFL was also headquartered in Dallas.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans conducted their inaugural training camp at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. The club embarked on a whirlwind pre-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorm]]ing tour that featured road games in Oakland, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Boston]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. An announced crowd of 51,000 at the Cotton Bowl witnessed a 24\u20133 victory against [[1960 Houston Oilers season|Houston]] on September 2 as the club concluded a perfect 6\u20130 preseason record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn both teams first 1960 season, the Dallas Texans and Dallas Cowboys competed on ticket sales.  For example, according to the book ''Ten-Gallon War'', the Texans offered discounted tickets at department stores and airline offices, free tickets for fill-ups at certain service stations, and even had free tickets \"stuffed inside helium-filled balloons set loose over the city.\"  In competition, the Dallas Cowboys had such promotions as hiring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for a halftime show.\n<ref name=\"Ten-Gallon War, John Eisenberg, 2012\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T91c2BFKKzAC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=%22stuffed+inside+helium-filled+balloons+set+loose+over+the+city%22&source=bl&ots=WPJ3V-zPFG&sig=Dt2ImLFn2MYlM6e8tO0z6hT1ss0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik2bHIhtPfAhUrgK0KHUotBGkQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stuffed%20inside%20helium-filled%20balloons%20set%20loose%20over%20the%20city%22&f=false Ten-Gallon War: The NFL\u2019s Cowboys, the AFL\u2019s Texans, and the Feud for Dallas's Pro Football Future], John Eisenberg, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012.</ref>\n\nIn their early years, the Texans had a strong home-state identity with [[quarterback]] [[Cotton Davidson]] from [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[linebacker]] [[Sherrill Headrick]] from [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] and [[running back]] [[Abner Haynes]] from [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]]. Haynes led the league with 875 rushing yards and nine TDs, as well as combined net yards (2,100) and punt return average (15.4).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Texans also had a flashy, high-scoring club which finished the year at 8\u20136 as three close losses kept the squad from challenging for the division title. The Texans averaged 24,500 for their home games, the highest average in the league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> In one attempt to draw more fans to their games, the Texans would offer free tickets to anyone who brought a ticket stub from the previous Friday's high school football game, to counter the NFL Cowboys' playing their home games on Friday night.\n\nIn [[1961 Dallas Texans season|1961]], the Texans and the NFL's Dallas Cowboys both drafted linebacker [[E.J. Holub]] from [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], described by many scouts as \"the best football player in America.\" Holub decided to play for the Texans, joining three future franchise Hall of Famers\u2014[[Jerry Mays (defensive lineman)|Jerry Mays]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Jim Tyrer]]\u2014as part of the club's draft class. The club moved its training camp to Lamar Hunt's [[alma mater]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] and started the regular season at 3\u20131 before hitting a six-game losing skid, the longest such streak of Stram's tenure with the franchise. The Texans rebounded to claim wins in three of its final four contests to finish 6\u20138, marking the club's second straight finish behind the [[1961 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in the AFL Western Conference standings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1962 Dallas Texans season|1962]], head coach Hank Stram was named AFL Coach of the Year and running back [[Curtis McClinton]] was named the AFL Rookie of the Year. Haynes became the franchise's first 1,000-yard rusher, concluding the season with 1,049 yards and an AFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans clinched their initial AFL Western Division Championship in November and finished with an 11\u20133 regular season record. The team won the [[1962 AFL Championship Game|1962 AFL Championship]] when [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Tommy Brooker]] connected on a 25-yard field goal during the second overtime of the title game, giving the Texans a 20\u201317 victory against the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]. Spanning an elapsed time of 77:54, the game stands as the third-longest contest in pro football history.<ref>Since 1984 the game has been the third-longest professional football game following a triple-overtime [[United States Football League|USFL]] playoff game between the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] and the [[Michigan Panthers]].</ref> Until a [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas Day]] playoff game in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1971]] between the [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] and [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]], the game was the longest ever played.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n===The move to Kansas City===\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] joined the NFL as an [[expansion team]] in {{nfly|1960}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1951\u20131960|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960#1960|publisher=National Football League|date=September 28, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the 1962 season, it was apparent that Dallas could not support two teams.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Even though the Texans had been far more successful on the field, Hunt investigated opportunities to move his team elsewhere for the [[1963 Kansas City Chiefs season|1963 season]], including [[Miami]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Seattle]] and [[New Orleans]]. Hunt wanted to find a city to which he could commute easily from Dallas, and when he was unable to secure [[Tulane Stadium]] because [[Tulane University|the university]] didn't want its [[Tulane Green Wave football|football program]] to compete with a pro team, he turned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where [[Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor]] [[H. Roe Bartle]] persuaded him to move to the Midwest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\"/>\n\nThe negotiations in Kansas City were conducted in secrecy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> On several occasions Hunt and Jack Steadman were in Kansas City and met with businessmen, without the general public's knowledge. Bartle introduced Hunt as \"Mr. Lamar\" in all the meetings with other Kansas City businessmen. Steadman was introduced as \"Jack X.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\">Covitz, Randy; Pulliam, Kent. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/special_packages/lamar_hunt/16234939.htm Chiefs' founder Lamar Hunt dies] ''Kansas City Star'', 14 December 2006.</ref>\n\nThe support the team received from the Kansas City community before the team announced the move was extraordinary. Hunt made the move dependent upon the ability of Mayor Bartle and the Kansas City community to guarantee him 35,000 in season ticket sales. Hunt had set this number, being that it was the Texans' average attendance at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. An ambitious campaign took shape to deliver on Bartle's guarantee to Hunt of tripling the season-ticket base the Texans had enjoyed in Dallas. Kansas City's mayor also promised to add 3,000 permanent seats to [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]], as well as 11,000 temporary bleacher seats. Along with Bartle, a number of other prominent Kansas Citians stepped forward to aid in the efforts, putting together more than 1,000 workers to sell season tickets.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nBartle called to his office 20 business leaders and called upon them to form an association later known as \"The Gold Coats\", whose sole objective was to sell and take down payments on the 35,000 season tickets required. \"The Gold Coats\" had to sell season tickets to people without knowing the team name, where it was coming from, who the owner was, which football league they would play in, who the players or coaches were, when the team would play its first game in Kansas City, or where it would play. Hunt gave Bartle a four-month deadline to accomplish the sales. Bartle and \"The Gold Coats\" made good in only 8 weeks. Later, Hunt admitted he was really only hoping for 20,000, for which he still would have moved the franchise. On May 22, Hunt announced he was moving the franchise to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ Kansas City Chiefs History 1960s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421185300/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |date=2007-04-21 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DallasTexansFootballClubNamingContestChiefs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Football Club Naming Contest Letter from Lamar Hunt]]\nHunt, with a roster replete with players who had played college football in Texas, wanted to maintain a lineage to the team's roots and wanted to name the club the '''Kansas City Texans'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\" /> \"The [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] stayed the Lakers when they moved from Minnesota to California\", he reasoned. \"But Jack Steadman convinced me that wasn't too smart. It wouldn't sell.\" The team was renamed the '''Kansas City Chiefs'''\u2014one of the most popular suggestions Hunt received in a name-the-team contest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\" />  Lamar Hunt sent letters dated June 21, 1963, to all the contest entrants who selected the name CHIEFS in the \"Rename the Texans\" contest of whom Mrs. Joan Feuerborn was one of those entrants, and along with their respective guesses as to the number of season tickets sold by May 1. The actual total was 10,808, and based on this the car winner was Mr. E. L. Diemler of Kansas City, Missouri, a warehouse manager who got the idea when making out a bill of lading to Chief Freight Lines.<ref>Flanagan, Jeffrey. Name-the-Chiefs winner was inspired by freight. KansasCity.com. 16 Jan 2007.</ref>  Another name also considered at the time for the team was the '''Kansas City Mules'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\" />\n\nThe name, \"Chiefs\" is not only derived from a fan contest, but also from Mayor Bartle, who 35 years prior, founded the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-based honor society known as ''The [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]]'' within the [[Scouting in Missouri|Boy Scouts of America]] organization, which earned him the nickname, \"The Chief.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs moved into Municipal Stadium, located at 22nd and Brooklyn, which opened in 1923 and had 49,002 seats. The Chiefs shared the facilities with the [[Kansas City Athletics]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. The first appearance of the Chiefs in Municipal Stadium attracted just 5,721 fans for a 17\u201313 pre-season victory against [[1963 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on August 9.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs' inaugural season in Kansas City began with owner Lamar Hunt's trade of starting quarterback [[Cotton Davidson]] to the Oakland Raiders, which landed the number one overall selection in the [[1963 AFL Draft|AFL Draft]] (which they used to select [[Buck Buchanan]]). Ironically, the Raiders would later select [[Gene Upshaw]] in [[1967 AFL Draft|1967]] for the express purpose of blocking Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs also selected guard [[Ed Budde]] from [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] with their other first round pick, and [[Bobby Bell]] from [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] in the seventh round. Buchanan, Budde and Bell all became starters on their way to a combined 526 games with the team and all three of them played their entire careers with the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nTragedy struck the club when rookie running back [[Stone Johnson]], who was a sprinter in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, suffered a fractured vertebra in his neck in a pre-season game against [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on August 30 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. He died 10 days later on September 8 and his jersey number 33 was subsequently retired.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs finished their first season in Kansas City with a 5\u20137\u20132 record and failed to reappear in the AFL Championship game for a consecutive year.\n\n===Building a champion, 1964\u20131969===\nIn [[1964 Kansas City Chiefs season|1964]], the Chiefs began the year with a 2\u20131 mark before dropping three consecutive games as several of the team's best players, including [[E.J. Holub]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] missed numerous games with injuries. Arbanas missed the final two games of the year after undergoing surgery to his left eye, in which he suffered almost total loss of vision. Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]], who signed with the club as a rookie free agent and received a mere $300 signing bonus, entered the starting lineup and earned a spot in the [[AFL All-Star Game]]. The club rounded out the season with two consecutive wins to close the season at 7\u20137, finishing second in the AFL Western Conference behind the [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. An average of just 18,126 fans attended each home game at Municipal Stadium, prompting discussion at the AFL owners' meeting about the Chiefs future in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor the [[1965 Kansas City Chiefs season|1965 season]], the Chiefs were once again caught in the middle of the AFL and NFL's bidding wars for college talent. Kansas City made running back [[Gale Sayers]] from the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]] their first-round draft pick, but Sayers eventually signed with the Bears for less money.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]] suffered torn ligaments in his right knee in the second to last regular season game of the year at Buffalo on December 12. Following what was expected to be a routine surgery on December 14 at Menorah Hospital in Kansas City, Hill died from what was termed \"a sudden and massive [[embolism]].\" Hunt called Hill's death \"the worst shock possible.\" Beginning the following year, the club annually bestowed the Mack Lee Hill Award on its top rookie or first-year performer in Hill's honor. Just days after Hill's unexpected death, the mourning Chiefs defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] on December 19 to finish the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]], the Chiefs were beginning to lay the groundwork for a return to the AFL Championship game and eventual dominance in the later years of the AFL. Team owner Lamar Hunt was publicly negotiating with NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] about a possible merger of the two leagues. [[Defensive end]] [[Aaron Brown (defensive lineman)|Aaron Brown]] was highly coveted by many clubs, including the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], who intended to select him. The Steelers couldn't locate Brown on draft day since he was already aboard a flight with Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who carried out the first mid-air signing in team history. The Chiefs signed [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Mike Garrett]] in the 20th round of the [[1966 AFL Draft]]. Garrett went on to earn AFL Rookie of the Year honors for the 1966 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs started the season at 3\u20130. A crowd of 43,885 attended the Chiefs home opener against the defending AFL Champion [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] on October 2, the largest ever to witness a sports event in Kansas City at the time. The Chiefs dropped a 29\u201314 decision to the Bills, but after the contest, Chiefs coach Hank Stram and Buffalo head coach [[Joe Collier]] negotiated a trade in the middle of the field. Kansas City received placekicker [[Mike Mercer (American football)|Mike Mercer]] for a fifth-round pick. Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the league in passing, while [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] became the first 1,000-yard receiver in franchise history, registering 1,297 yards. The Chiefs finished three games in front of Oakland to claim an AFL Western Conference title with an 11\u20132\u20131 record, setting the stage for the franchise's second trip to the [[1966 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|The Chiefs and the Packers in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I)]]\nUsing a dazzling [[I-formation|I-formation offense]] and a smothering defense, the Chiefs claimed a dominating 31\u20137 victory in the AFL title game at Buffalo on [[New Year's Day]], 1967. That victory propelled Kansas City to the [[Super Bowl I|first AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as the [[Super Bowl]]. At the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Chiefs met [[Vince Lombardi]]'s powerful [[Green Bay Packers]] of the National Football League on January 15, 1967. The Chiefs played the Packers close for a half, trailing 14\u201310, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor [[1967 Kansas City Chiefs season|1967]], the club's special teams got a boost with the addition of kicker [[Jan Stenerud]], and [[kick returner]] [[Noland Smith|Noland \"Super Gnat\" Smith]]. The Chiefs' first regular season game against an NFL team resulted in a commanding 66\u201324 Chiefs victory against the [[1967 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] at Municipal Stadium on August 23. Injuries again hit the club hard during the regular season as the Chiefs clawed their way to a 9\u20135 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nInterest in the team skyrocketed following the team's appearance in the AFL-NFL Championship Game, forcing an increase in [[seating capacity]] at Municipal Stadium from 40,000 to 47,000. In June, [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] voters approved a $43 million bond issue for construction of a sports complex<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> to be completed by 1972. Eastern Jackson County was chosen as the site of the Chiefs and Royals' new stadiums, and groundbreaking ceremonies took place in July with plans calling for a unique \"rolling roof\" design (which was later scrapped).\n\nThe [[1968 Kansas City Chiefs season|1968 Chiefs]] defense allowed a franchise-low 170 points (12.1 ppg). The nucleus of the defensive unit was in its prime, producing six AFL All-Stars, including all three of the squad's linebackers. Offensively, quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the AFL in passing for the fourth time. The Chiefs began the season with a 7\u20131 record and rattled off five straight victories to close the regular season at 12\u20132, sharing the AFL Western Conference title with the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and setting up a one-game playoff between the two teams. Kansas City lost a 41\u20136 decision at Oakland on December 22 as the Raiders advanced to the [[American Football League playoffs#1968 Championship|1968 AFL Championship Game]] against the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The loss to Oakland is considered to be the beginning of the [[Chiefs-Raiders rivalry|Chiefs' rivalry with the Raiders]], one of the NFL's most [[National Football League rivalries|bitter feuds]].\n\nThe Chiefs used the momentum they built during the 1968 campaign by posting a perfect 6\u20130 record during pre-season play for [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]]. The team began the regular season with four consecutive road games for the only time in team history. After a decisive 27\u20139 win at [[1969 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 14, the club posted a 31\u20130 shutout at [[1969 Boston Patriots season|Boston]] on September 21. During the game, quarterback Len Dawson sustained a knee injury which would sideline him for the following two months.\n\nThe once-optimistic picture for the Chiefs went from bad to worse the following week when back-up quarterback [[Jacky Lee (American football)|Jacky Lee]] went down with a broken ankle in a 24\u201319 loss at [[1969 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] on September 28. That injury left the team's most crucial position in the hands of second-year quarterback [[Mike Livingston]], who took just five snaps as a rookie in 1968.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> However, Livingston engineered a five-game winning streak, while getting plenty of help from the club's defense. The team's home opener was played in a day-long deluge referred to as a \"frog-strangler\" by Chiefs radio broadcaster [[Bill Grigsby]]. The Chiefs and [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] combined for 14 fumbles in a 24\u20130 Kansas City victory on October 12. Len Dawson returned to the starting lineup in a 27\u20133 win against San Diego on November 9 and guided the club to three wins in the season's next four games.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the [[1969 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 31\u201317 on [[NFL Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving Day]]. Trailing 24\u201317 late in the game, Denver attempted an [[onside kick]] that was recovered by linebacker Bobby Bell, who promptly returned that kick for a 53-yard [[touchdown]]. Mike Livingston started the following week against [[1969 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on December 7 for an again-injured Dawson, who returned for the regular season finale at Oakland on December 13. A 10\u20136 loss against the Raiders gave the Chiefs an 11\u20133 record, good for second in the AFC Western Conference behind [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] (12\u20131\u20131).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = The Chiefs topped the Raiders in the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL championship game]] (''left'') and went on to defeat the Vikings in Super Bowl IV (''right'').\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = 1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg\n | width1 = 140\n | image2 =1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp.jpg\n | width2 = 140\n}}\nIn an AFL Divisional Playoff Game at [[1969 New York Jets season|New York]], Kansas City rode its dominating defense which produced a crucial goal-line stand en route to a 13\u20136 win over the [[Super Bowl III|defending Super Bowl champion]] Jets to set up a rematch with the Raiders in the [[1969 AFL Championship|final AFL Championship Game]]. Looking for retribution of the previous losses in the regular season and in the 1968 playoffs, the Chiefs became the league's only three-time champions, defeating the Raiders by a 17\u20137 count at Oakland on January 4, 1970.\n\nDuring the days preceding Kansas City's clash with the [[spread betting|heavily favored]] [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] of the NFL, unsubstantiated media reports associating Len Dawson with a known gambler hounded the Chiefs quarterback.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Dawson was later revealed to be mistaken for another man with the same last name. The night before Super Bowl IV, [[Ed Sabol]] of [[NFL Films]] approached Vikings coach [[Bud Grant]] about being wired for sound for the game. Grant declined, but Chiefs coach [[Hank Stram]] accepted. As both the Chiefs and the cameras rolled, Stram clamored for his team to run \"65 toss power trap\" and to \"keep matriculating the ball down the field.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Stram became the first-ever coach to be wired for NFL Films, and ironically, as a coach in the rival AFL.\n\nThe Chiefs used the game as a crusade for the American Football League and wore \"AFL-10\" patches honoring the league's 10-year existence. The Chiefs used three field goals from Jan Stenerud and a rushing touchdown from Mike Garrett to take a 16\u20130 halftime lead. A dynamic 46-yard TD pass from Len Dawson to Otis Taylor in the third quarter sealed the victory as Dawson was named the game's [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Perhaps the grittiest performance of the day came from [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], who registered two interceptions and a fumble recovery despite playing with three broken ribs. At approximately 5:20 PM, the final seconds ticked off the clock at [[Tulane Stadium]] as the Chiefs were crowned World Champions by claiming a 23\u20137 victory in the final game between the AFL and NFL.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A victory parade ensued upon the club's triumphant return the following day in [[downtown Kansas City]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Super Bowl IV]] was the last championship won by the Chiefs until [[Super Bowl LIV]],\n\n==Alignment to the NFL==\n\n===Fall from glory, 1970\u20131977===\nFollowing their championship win, the NFL-AFL merger placed the Chiefs in the newly created AFC West division with the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos. The team traded running back Mike Garrett to San Diego in [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]] and replaced him in the lineup with [[Ed Podolak]]. Despite a 44\u201324 win against [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] on September 28 in just the second-ever telecast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' package, the Chiefs owned a 3\u20133\u20131 record at the season's midpoint. The Chiefs and the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] tied a game at 17\u201317 on November 1 following a controversial play from Oakland. The Chiefs were ahead 17\u201314 when Len Dawson apparently sealed the win, running for a first down which would have allowed Kansas City to run out the clock. While on the ground, Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]] in an infamous incident that cost the Chiefs a victory and further inflamed the already heated Chiefs-Raiders rivalry.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wide receiver Otis Taylor retaliated and a bench-clearing brawl ensued. Offsetting penalties were called, nullifying Dawson's first down. The Chiefs were forced to punt and Raiders kicker [[George Blanda]] booted a game-tying field goal with eight seconds remaining. That tie ultimately cost the Chiefs the opportunity to split the AFC West division title with Oakland as Kansas City finished the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record, while the Raiders went 8\u20134\u20132 and reached the conference championship.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = I always thought that our best team was the peak of our best team, our '71 squad.\n| source = -[[Lamar Hunt]]<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n| salign = right\n}}\n\nIn [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|1971]], the Chiefs were regarded by many as the finest squad ever assembled by the franchise, including team owner Lamar Hunt. The team featured a franchise record 11 Pro Bowlers. Offensively, wide receiver Otis Taylor led the league with 1,110 receiving yards. In just his third pro season, Ed Podolak surpassed Abner Haynes as the all-time leading rusher in team history. The longstanding linebacking trio of Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell and Jim Lynch was the league's best. The offensive line was headlined by guard Ed Budde and tackle Jim Tyrer, while the defensive front featured a pair of Pro Bowlers in tackles Buck Buchanan and [[Curley Culp]].

A 16\u201314 victory against Oakland on December 12 gave the franchise its initial AFC West title.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The great promise of the 1971 campaign ended dramatically in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs#AFC: Miami Dolphins 27.2C Kansas City Chiefs 24 .282OT.29|the longest game]] in NFL history, an AFC Divisional Playoff Game played on Christmas Day against the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. It took 82:40<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> to finish the contest, but a 37-yard field goal from Dolphins kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] finally ended this epic as Miami claimed a 27\u201324 double [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] win in the final football contest played at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium. Chiefs' running back Ed Podolak accounted for 350 combined net yards, a figure that remains an NFL post-season record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The baton of power in the AFC was officially passed to the Dolphins, who went on to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. It would be the Chiefs' last playoff appearance for 15 years, effectively signaling the conclusion of the franchise's glory days.\n\nIn [[1972 Kansas City Chiefs season|1972]], the last original member of the 1960 Dallas Texans team departed when safety [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] announced his retirement at training camp. Meanwhile, starting quarterback Len Dawson ended speculation about his retirement by signing a two-year contract. Franchise owner Lamar Hunt became the first AFL figure to be inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on July 29.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nAfter two different construction strikes and a myriad of other delays, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] was officially dedicated on August 12 when the Chiefs registered a 24\u201314 victory against the [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. Running back Ed Podolak scored the first touchdown in the facility. Regular season ticket prices for the team's first season at Arrowhead were [[USD]]$8 for box seats and $7 for reserved seating.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOn September 17, the Chiefs lost a 20\u201310 decision against Miami in the first regular season game at Arrowhead in front of a crowd of 79,829.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A standing-room-only crowd of 82,094 fans was in attendance for a 27\u201314 victory against [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5, the largest \"in-house\" attendance total for an NFL contest in Arrowhead's history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After a 5\u20133 start, a three-game losing streak effectively eliminated the club from playoff contention, including an embarrassing home loss to the winless Philadelphia Eagles. An 8\u20136 record was good enough for only a second-place finish in the AFC West behind Oakland. Linebacker Willie Lanier became the first Chiefs player to receive the NFL Man of the Year Award in the offseason.\n\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket) (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Dawson pictured later in his career with the Chiefs]]\nFor [[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|1973]], quarterback Mike Livingston started in a 23\u201313 Opening Day loss against [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], but Len Dawson returned to rally the club for three consecutive wins to get the club off to a 3\u20131 start for a third consecutive year. The aging Len Dawson made his final start of the year in a 23\u201314 loss at [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 29 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and was replaced for the remainder of the year by Livingston, beginning a string of three straight seasons in which both players split time at the position.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Livingston led the club to another three straight wins, putting the team in first place in mid-November with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A 1\u20132\u20131 ledger over the season's final month ended the club's post-season aspirations as the team finished the year in a second-place tie with [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at 7\u20135\u20132. Len Dawson became the second Chiefs player in as many years to win the NFL Man of the Year Award. Following [[Super Bowl VIII]], The [[1974 Pro Bowl|AFC-NFC Pro Bowl]] was held at Arrowhead Stadium on January 20 with the AFC claiming a 15\u201313 win thanks to five field goals from Miami placekicker Garo Yepremian.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWhile the club's sparkling new facility at Arrowhead Stadium was drawing rave reviews, the Chiefs roster was beginning to show its age in [[1974 Kansas City Chiefs season|1974]]. The result was the team's first losing season in 11 years as the club was unable to string together consecutive victories during the year, a first in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Most of the team's starters were advancing in age: Len Dawson was 39, Jim Tyrer was 35, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, and Ed Budde were 34, Dave Hill was 33 and Otis Taylor was 32.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOne of the year's few bright spots in the 5\u20139 season was cornerback [[Emmitt Thomas]], who led the league with a franchise-record 12 interceptions. The final game of the 1974 campaign marked the final time all five of Kansas City's future Hall of Fame players from the club's AFL championship era took the field together with coach Hank Stram. Including Lamar Hunt and five future Minnesota Vikings Hall of Famers, an amazing total of 12 Hall of Fame inductees were involved in that 1974 season finale game. That 35\u201315 loss against Super Bowl-bound [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] provided an anticlimactic conclusion to Hank Stram's illustrious coaching career in Kansas City. Stram, the only head coach in franchise history was relieved of his duties on December 27 after compiling a 124\u201376\u201310 regular season record with the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n[[San Francisco 49ers]] defensive coordinator [[Paul Wiggin]] was named the second head coach in franchise history on January 23, [[1975 Kansas City Chiefs season|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wiggin inherited the unenviable task of rebuilding a squad whose pool of talent had been largely depleted due to age and a number of ill-considered trades that had left the club devoid of first-round draft choices in [[1973 NFL Draft|1973]] and [[1975 NFL Draft|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After an 0\u20133 start to the season, Wiggin directed the Chiefs to three straight wins, beginning with a convincing 42\u201310 victory against the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. The highlight of the season was a 34\u201331 upset win at Dallas on ''Monday Night Football''. The club could not maintain the early success; owning a 5\u20135 record heading into the home stretch of the season, injuries to a number of key players crippled the team. The team dropped its final four contests of the year to finish at 5\u20139 for the second consecutive season. The regular season finale at Oakland marked the final games in the Hall of Fame careers of Len Dawson and Buck Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBy [[1976 Kansas City Chiefs season|1976]], many of the Chiefs' championship players were on their way out of Kansas City. Buck Buchanan announced his retirement in February, while Dawson announced his own departure on May 1.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Off the field, Jack Steadman was promoted to team president and [[Jim Schaaf]] was named general manager in August. On the field, Kansas City's fortunes didn't improve in the second year of the Wiggin regime. The club dropped three straight home games, including a 27\u201317 loss to a [[1976 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] team coached by Stram, before suffering a 50\u201317 setback at [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 3, opening the season at 0\u20134 for the first time in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The team registered a 3\u20131 record during a successful midseason stretch, but like most of the previous seasons, could not maintain that momentum.\n\nAfter lingering in Len Dawson's shadow for eight seasons, Mike Livingston was firmly entrenched as the team's starting quarterback, becoming the first QB to start every regular season game since Dawson in 1968. Although Livingston played well and rallied the squad for wins in two of the season's final three games, the Chiefs still ended the year with their third consecutive 5\u20139 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Running back [[MacArthur Lane]] was the club's top offensive threat, becoming the only player at the time in franchise history to lead the league in receptions (66).\n\nOn the field, the Chiefs suffered their worst season ever in [[1977 Kansas City Chiefs season|1977]], winning just twice and undergoing a mid-season coaching change. Following three consecutive 5\u20139 seasons, the team finished with a league worst 2\u201312 record. An 0\u20135 start doomed the squad with a 44\u20137 loss at Cleveland, where Wiggin starred as a defensive lineman during the Browns' glory days, effectively sealing the coach's fate. Wiggin was relieved of his duties on [[Halloween]], marking the only in-season coaching switch in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Defensive backs coach [[Tom Bettis]] was named interim coach and claimed a 20\u201310 victory against Green Bay in the club's initial contest under his direction, but it was the only victory of his brief head coaching tenure.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBettis and the remainder of the coaching staff assembled by Wiggin were relieved on December 19, one day after a 21\u201320 loss at Oakland in the regular season finale.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Marv Levy]], the former head coach of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Montreal Alouettes]], was named the fourth head coach in franchise history the following day. The heart and soul of the Chiefs once-vaunted defense departed when Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch retired following the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n===Signs of improvement, 1978\u20131982===\nFor [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]], Marv Levy's systematic restocking of a relatively barren defensive roster began with a [[1978 NFL Draft|1978 draft class]] that included defensive end [[Art Still]] and linebacker [[Gary Spani]]. Running back Ed Podolak, who was the club's all-time leading rusher at the time, retired in the offseason on June 15.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nPerhaps Levy's most unconventional tactic in rebuilding the Chiefs was installing the \"[[Wing-T offense]]\". \"It was a situation where we took over a team that had the worst defensive record in the history of the National Football League\", Levy explained. \"We wanted to keep that defense off the field, so we ran the ball 60 times a game.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The 1978 Chiefs team ran and ran often, posting franchise records with 663 rushing attempts and 2,986 ground yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Levy's squad ran the ball a staggering 69 times in a 24\u201323 Opening Day win at Cincinnati on September 3, the most rushing attempts in an NFL contest since [[1948 NFL season|1948]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Five different players had 100-yard rushing games during the year, including running back [[Tony Reed]], who finished the season with 1,053 yards to become the team's first 1,000-yard back since 1967.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Despite the squad's Opening Day success, the club lost 10 of its next 11 games, including a pair of overtime decisions. However, the team showed signs of improvement with the defense recording a 23\u20130 shutout against [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on November 26 as the club concluded its first 16-game schedule with a 4\u201312 mark.\n\nIn [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|1979]], Kansas City owned a pair of picks in the first round of the [[1979 NFL Draft|Draft]], selecting defensive end [[Mike Bell (defensive lineman)|Mike Bell]] and quarterback [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]]. By the season's third game, Fuller had supplanted Mike Livingston as the club's starter.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWith Fuller at the helm, the Chiefs owned a 4\u20132 record after six games, but a five-game mid-season losing stretch sullied that effort. Despite finishing fifth in the AFC West for a second straight season, Kansas City's 7\u20139 record was a notable accomplishment considering the fact that the division's other four clubs all posted winning records for a second consecutive season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The Chiefs lost a 3\u20130 decision at [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on December 16 in one of the most water-logged contests in franchise annals. As both clubs struggled to move the ball under monsoon-like conditions, a late, fourth-quarter field goal by the Buccaneers averted the NFL's first scoreless tie since [[1943 NFL season|1943]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 Kansas City Chiefs season|1980]], the Chiefs selected guard [[Brad Budde]] in the first round of the [[1980 NFL Draft|Draft]], the son of former Chiefs guard Ed Budde, as the team's first-round draft choice, making the Buddes the first father-son combination to become first-round draftees of the same team in NFL history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> In a then-controversial move on August 26, the Chiefs released placekicker Jan Stenerud, who at the time was club's all-time leading scorer. He was replaced by journeyman [[Nick Lowery]], who had been cut 11 times by eight different teams himself.\n\nAfter enduring an 0\u20134 start, the club rebounded to post a four-game winning streak, starting with a 31\u201317 victory in Oakland, in which Raiders quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] broke his leg and was replaced by [[Jim Plunkett]], who guided the team to the [[Super Bowl XV]] championship. After Steve Fuller was sidelined with a knee injury late in the season, former Miami 12th-round draft choice [[Bill Kenney]] became the team's starting quarterback. He was so anonymous that when he appeared in that contest, the name on the back of his jersey was inadvertently misspelled \"Kenny.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Kenney went on to lead the club to a 31\u201314 victory against Denver on December 7 in his initial NFL start. The defense continued to evolve as defensive end Art Still and safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the first Chiefs defensive players to be elected to the Pro Bowl in five seasons.

Second-round draft choice, running back [[Joe Delaney]] electrified the club's offense by rushing for 1,121 yards, a team single-season record at the time.

Bill Kenney missed the club's final three contests due to injury as Steve Fuller temporarily reclaimed the starting QB position and guided the club to a 10\u20136 win at Minnesota, in the final contest played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]]. With the Chiefs winning the game, Vikings fans began dismembering the stadium as early as the second half\u2014taking seats, pieces of the scoreboard and even chunks of sod as souvenirs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The victory assured the Chiefs of a 9\u20137 record, the club's first winning mark since 1973 as coach Marv Levy increased the club's victory total for a third consecutive year. Inspired by the [[Washington Redskins]]'s \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\", Levy penned a fight song for the Chiefs (\"Give a Cheer for Kansas City\"), but much like the team's Wing-T offense, the concept never really caught on.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nIn [[1982 Kansas City Chiefs season|1982]], running back Joe Delaney underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in his eye, a radical procedure at the time.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Optimism abounded at Arrowhead thanks to the club's promising 9\u20137 record from 1981, but swelling labor unrest from NFL players spelled doom for both the Chiefs and Levy in 1982. The Chiefs split their first two games of the year before a 57-day [[1982 NFL strike|strike]] by the [[NFL Players Association]] began at midnight on September 20. The strike concluded on November 17 after six games were canceled and one was rescheduled, but the Chiefs would never recover, dropping four straight games after their return to the field. Center [[Jack Rudnay]], who had been one of the franchise's most durable and decorated offensive performers over the past decade, announced on December 20 that he would retire after the season. Despite wins in two of the season's final three games, the Levy era concluded as the club finished the strike-shortened campaign at 3\u20136.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n===Unbalanced chemistry, 1983\u20131988===\n\n====1983====\n{{details|1983 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nTo begin 1983, the Chiefs fired head coach Marv Levy on January 4 after compiling a 31\u201342 record. [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterbacks coach [[John Mackovic]] was named the fifth head coach in team history on February 2. The 39-year-old Mackovic became the youngest individual ever to hold that post for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs held the seventh overall pick in the quarterback-laden [[1983 NFL Draft]] and selected [[Todd Blackledge]]. The five other signal-callers selected in the first round that year included [[John Elway]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Tony Eason]], [[Ken O'Brien]] and [[Dan Marino]].\n\nTragedy struck the club on June 29 when Joe Delaney [[drowned]] trying to save the lives of three youngsters in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Delaney was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal by [[Ronald Reagan]] on July 13.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Linebacker Bobby Bell became the first Chiefs player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> providing some solace for the mourning Chiefs fan base following Joe Delaney's death.\n\nWith Kenney and Blackledge both on the roster, starting QB Steve Fuller was traded to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] on August 19. Kenney earned a Pro Bowl berth after racking up a franchise-record 4,348 passing yards, while wide receiver [[Carlos Carson]] hauled in 80 passes for 1,351 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite the team's high-flying passing game, head coach John Mackovic had trouble finding a suitable replacement for Joe Delaney and the running back position. The highest scoring contest in franchise history took place as the Chiefs and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] combined for 99 points in a wild, 51\u201348 overtime loss at the [[Kingdome]]. A meager crowd of 11,377 attended the club's season-ending 48\u201317 win against [[1983 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] on December 18, the smallest attendance figure ever for a Chiefs game at Arrowhead as the club finished the year at 6\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1984====\n{{details|1984 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nPro Bowl safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the most notable Chiefs player to defect to the rival [[United States Football League]], signing with the [[New Jersey Generals]] on February 2 after sitting out the entire 1983 campaign in a contract dispute.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Barbaro's departure and the trade of cornerback [[Gary Green (American football)|Gary Green]] began a youth movement that produced the most vaunted secondary in team history. Cornerbacks [[Kevin Ross (American football)|Kevin Ross]] and [[Albert Lewis (American football)|Albert Lewis]], and safeties [[Deron Cherry]] and [[Lloyd Burruss]] accounted for a combined 13 Pro Bowl appearances for the Chiefs<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> in the years to come.\n\nAll-America defensive tackle [[Bill Maas]] and offensive tackle [[John Alt]] were both selected in the first round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]]. Maas was named [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]], while Alt eventually became the cornerstone of the club's offensive line later in the decade. Kansas City's defense registered a team-record 11.0 sacks in a 10\u20136 win against Cleveland on September 30, coming one sack shy of the NFL single-game record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nQuarterback Bill Kenney suffered a broken thumb during the preseason and was sidelined until the season's seventh week. Second year back-up QB Todd Blackledge opened the first six contests of the season and had the club at 3\u20133. Kenney returned to the starting lineup against the [[1984 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] on October 21, but inconsistency marked the rest of the season as the club dropped four of first five contests after his return. However, the team rattled off three consecutive wins to conclude the year at 8\u20138.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1985====\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|100px|A ticket for a 1985 game between the Chiefs and the Denver Broncos]]\n{{details|1985 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a flying start in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] with a 47\u201327 win at [[1985 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], while safety [[Deron Cherry]] tied an NFL record by registering four interceptions in a 28\u20137 win against [[1985 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 29 as the club boasted a 3\u20131 record four games into the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club was then confronted with a seven-game losing streak that wasn't snapped until QB Todd Blackledge was installed as the starter against [[1985 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]] on November 24. The team rebounded to win three of its final five contests of the year with Blackledge under center, further inflaming a quarterback controversy that continued into the 1986 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOne of the few remaining bright spots in a disappointing 6\u201310 season came in the regular season finale against [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] when wide receiver [[Stephone Paige]] set an NFL record with 309 receiving yards in a 38\u201334 win, breaking the previous mark of 303 yards set by [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland's]] [[Jim Benton (American football)|Jim Benton]] in [[1945 NFL season|1945]]. Paige's mark was subsequently surpassed by a 336-yard effort by [[Flipper Anderson]] (L.A.

On the field, the pieces started coming together for head coach John Mackovic. His offense displayed plenty of scoring punch, while the club's defense and special teams became increasingly effective.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With the team sitting at 3\u20133, Bill Kenney replaced Todd Blackledge for the second half of the season in a game against San Diego,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> guiding the club to a 42\u201341 victory. That win was the first of four consecutive triumphs with Kenney at the helm, the club's longest winning streak since 1980. Poised with a 7\u20133 record after 10 games, three straight losses in November put the Chiefs playoff chances in jeopardy. Two December wins gave Kansas City a 9\u20136 mark, putting the Chiefs on the verge of their first postseason berth in 15 years.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nThe defining moment of the season came in the regular season finale at [[1986 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on December 21.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite being outgained in total yardage by a 515-to-171-yard margin, the Chiefs were able to notch a 24\u201319 victory as all of the team's points came via special teams on a blocked punt return, a field goal, a kickoff return and a blocked field goal return.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With a 10\u20136 record the Chiefs earned an AFC Wild Card berth, winning a tiebreaker with Seattle. Bill Kenney was injured in the fourth quarter of the Steelers contest, meaning Todd Blackledge would draw the starting assignment for the club's first playoff contest since 1971, a 35\u201315 loss at [[1985 New York Jets season|New York]].\n\n====1987====\n{{details|1987 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOne of the most tumultuous weeks in franchise history took place following the club's playoff loss against the Jets. Assistant head coach and special teams coach [[Frank Gansz]], resigned his position on January 7 in order to pursue opportunities as an NFL offensive coordinator.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The following day, the Chiefs announced in an impromptu press conference that John Mackovic was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 8. A popular figure among Chiefs players, Gansz was reinstated on January 10 and was named the sixth head coach in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nFormer quarterback Len Dawson became the third Chiefs player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> while injuries forced the retirement of the club's all-time leading tackler Gary Spani. A duo of rookies made a splash in a 20\u201313 win on Opening Day against San Diego as running back [[Paul Palmer (American football)|Paul Palmer]] returned a kickoff for a TD and [[Christian Okoye]] dashed for 105 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> A 24-day players strike began on September 22, effectively canceling the club's contest against [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Replacement players participated in games for the next three weeks. Much like Marv Levy five years earlier, Gansz's grip on the club's coaching reins was crippled by the labor unrest.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nKansas City's replacement squad consisted primarily of players cut in training camp. One of the few bright spots among this motley crew was running back Jitter Fields, who remained on the active roster following the strike.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs strike squad received an ominous welcome in Los Angeles when in the early morning hours of October 4, the day prior to a contest against the Raiders, an earthquake rattled [[Southern California]]. The shaken Chiefs lost a 35\u201317 decision later that day. The low point of the year came the following week at Miami in the first regular season game played at what then was known as [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. Chiefs replacement QB [[Matt Stevens (quarterback)|Matt Stevens]] was injured early in the contest, forcing into duty QB [[Alex Espinoza]], a player who had never taken an NFL snap. The result was a 42\u20130 Dolphins victory, setting the stage for an 0\u20133 performance by Kansas City's replacement unit, giving the Chiefs a 1\u20134 record before the club's regular roster returned at San Diego on October 25.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Five straight losses followed, giving the Chiefs a team-record nine-game losing skid. For the only time in team history, five different players started games at quarterback for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Behind Kenney, Kansas City won two of its last three games to conclude the [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] 4\u201311 campaign.\n\n====1988====\n{{details|1988 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe spring was marked by several notable trades as the club jockeyed to improve on its 4\u201311 finish in 1987. Todd Blackledge was traded to Pittsburgh on March 29 and 12-year veteran quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]] was acquired from Tampa Bay on March 31. The Chiefs moved up one spot in the first round of the draft to select defensive end [[Neil Smith (football player)|Neil Smith]] with the third overall pick. Bill Kenney opened the team's initial two games at quarterback, but was replaced by DeBerg for the second half against Seattle.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> DeBerg guided the team to a 20\u201313 win against [[1988 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] in his initial start as a member of the Chiefs. However, six losses and a tie followed as Kenney and DeBerg jostled for the QB job.\n\nAs the season drew to a close, it became apparent the winds of change were blowing across the organization. President Jack Steadman resigned on December 8, while general manager Jim Schaaf was relieved of his duties the same day.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Steadman was later named Chairman of the Board. On the field, the Chiefs finished the year at 4\u201311\u20131 as questions swirled regarding Gansz's future and who would fill the club's leadership void. One day after the season's conclusion, former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and USFL executive [[Carl Peterson]] was named the club's President/General Manager and Chief Operating Officer on December 19.\n\n==A change of face==\n\n===\"Martyball\", 1989\u20132000===\n{{Further|1989 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nAfter compiling an 8\u201322\u20131 record in two seasons, Frank Gansz was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 5, 1989. General manager Carl Peterson's selection as Gansz's successor would be former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]], who was named the seventh head coach in Chiefs history on January 24. The first draft choice of the Peterson era set the tone for the next decade as the club selected linebacker [[Derrick Thomas]] with the fourth overall selection. Thomas paired with defensive end Neil Smith to form one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in NFL history, compiling a combined 212.5 sacks during their illustrious Chiefs careers. The Peterson-Schottenheimer era got off to an inauspicious start in a 34\u201320 loss at Denver on September 10 as quarterback Steve DeBerg's first pass attempt was intercepted and returned for a TD.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club won just four times in its next 10 games as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] and [[Steve Pelluer]], who was acquired in a trade from Dallas, each opened three games apiece during that span. DeBerg regained the starting job for the final five weeks of the season, generating four wins that put the Chiefs just out of post-season qualification at 8\u20137\u20131. A 34\u20130 shutout win against Houston highlighted the club's stretch run. Running back Christian Okoye became the first Chief to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,480 yards, while Derrick Thomas won consensus NFL Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1990====\n{{Further|1990 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe foundation for the club's formidable offensive line of the 1990s gathered two key ingredients when center [[Tim Grunhard]] and guard [[Dave Szott]] were acquired in the [[1990 NFL Draft]]. Construction began on the club's indoor practice facility at the Truman Sports Complex, giving the Chiefs an 80-yard indoor field and weight room facilities upon its completion. Former defensive tackle Buck Buchanan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4. In the pre-season, The Chiefs made their initial overseas appearance, losing a 19\u20133 [[American Bowl]] decision against the [[1990 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in Berlin, Germany. Schottenheimer's club got out of the starting gate quickly, winning three of their first four games.

Kansas City led the NFL with a franchise-record 60.0 sacks, including a team-record 20.0 by Derrick Thomas. Thomas established an NFL single-game record with 7.0 sacks in an inspiring [[Veterans Day]] performance against [[1990 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]], a game the Seahawks miraculously won, 17\u201316, on a last-second, 25-yard TD pass to wide receiver [[Paul Skansi]]. That loss brought on the furious stretch run which saw the club record victories in six of its last seven outings. Behind DeBerg's offensive leadership (23 TD passes with just four interceptions) Kansas City finished the year with a franchise-best +26 turnover differential. The Chiefs clinched their first post-season berth since 1986 with a 24\u201321 win at San Diego and finished the year at 11\u20135, marking the franchise's best finish since 1969. The Chiefs suffered a heart-breaking, 17\u201316 loss at Miami on January 5, 1991 in an AFC Wild Card Game as placekicker Nick Lowery's potential game-winning 52-yard field goal fell short with 0:56 remaining.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1991====\n{{Further|1991 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOn July 27, former placekicker Jan Stenerud became the first of his position to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The club finished the regular season at 10\u20136, marking the first time since 1968\u201369 that the franchise had qualified for the playoffs in consecutive seasons. A 27\u201321 victory against the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in the regular season finale gave the Chiefs the right to host the Raiders just six days later in the inaugural post-season game in Arrowhead's history, and the Chiefs' first home playoff game in 20 years. Thanks to six Los Angeles turnovers, the Chiefs registered their first post-season victory since Super Bowl IV with a 10\u20136 win in an AFC Wild Card Game on December 28.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> The following week, the Chiefs lost a 37\u201314 decision at Buffalo on January 5, 1992 in an AFC Divisional Playoff match-up as the Buffalo Bills' dynamic offense proved to be too much for the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1992====\n{{Further|1992 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA longtime nemesis with Seattle, \"Plan B\" free agent quarterback [[Dave Krieg]] was signed as the club's starter on March 19. A melancholy off-season awaited the Chiefs, who mourned the passing of Player Personnel Director Whitey Dovell on May 22 and Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan on July 16. Both Dovell and Buchanan lost courageous battles with cancer. Six-time Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry announced his retirement in July after registering 50 interceptions in 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs retired the jerseys of former players Buck Buchanan (#86), Willie Lanier (#63) and Jan Stenerud (#3) in a ceremony prior to a pre-season contest against Buffalo.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nFirst-round draft pick, cornerback [[Dale Carter]] won the Bert Bell Trophy as the NFL's Rookie of the Year. The very first time Carter touched the ball in an NFL contest, he registered a 46-yard punt return touchdown in a 24\u201310 win at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 6. Running back Christian Okoye surpassed Ed Podolak as the all-time leading rusher in team history against [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 13. Injuries eventually made the 1992 campaign Okoye's last with the Chiefs after he compiled 4,897 rushing yards with the franchise. The club got off to a 3\u20131 start, but was faced with a 4\u20134 record at the season's midpoint. Despite four consecutive victories, the club's post-season hopes still came down to the season's final contest. Owning a 9\u20136 record and needing one more victory to secure a playoff berth, the Chiefs defense tallied three touchdowns, while Dave Krieg tossed a pair of scoring passes as Kansas City claimed a 42\u201320 win against Denver to finish the season at 10\u20136. Despite the big win against [[1992 Denver Broncos season|Denver]], the Chiefs made a quick exit from the playoffs as Krieg was sacked 7 times in a 17\u20130 AFC Wild Card loss at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on January 2, 1993.\n\n====1993====\n{{Further|1993 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs spent the off-season installing the \"[[West Coast offense]]\" under the direction of new offensive coordinator [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]], who at one time served as quarterbacks coach to [[Joe Montana]] in San Francisco. On April 20, the Chiefs traded for Joe Montana, who directed the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories in the previous decade. Guard [[Will Shields]] was selected with the club's third-round draft choice, rounding out the \"law firm\" of Grunhard, Szott and Shields which anchored the interior of Chiefs offensive line for most of the decade.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn June 9, the club signed unrestricted free agent running back [[Marcus Allen]], who had spent 11 seasons tormenting the Chiefs as a member of the rival Los Angeles Raiders. Montana and Allen made their debuts in a 27\u20133 win at [[1993 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on September 5, marking Montana's first Opening Day appearance since 1990. Shields initiated a franchise-record streak of 175 consecutive starts the following week at [[1993 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Thanks to a pair of ''Monday Night Football'' wins at Arrowhead, the club owned a 6\u20132 mid-season record. Before taking the field in a Sunday night contest at [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on December 26, the team learned it had clinched its first AFC West title since 1971 thanks to a [[1993 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] loss earlier in the day. The team finished the season with an 11\u20135 regular season record, marking the club's fourth consecutive year with a double-digit victory tally. Linebacker Derrick Thomas was named the NFL's Man of the Year following the season. Thomas, who founded \"The Third and Long Foundation\", received the honor in large part due to his efforts in promoting children's literacy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nKansas City got its first true taste of \"Montana Magic\" as the Hall of Fame passer engineered a brilliant comeback in a 27\u201324 OT win in an AFC Wild Card thriller against [[1993 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on January 8, 1994. Next, the Chiefs traveled to the [[Astrodome]] to face the red-hot Oilers, who had won 11 straight games to conclude the regular season. The heavily favored Oilers opened up a 13\u20137 lead in the fourth quarter, but once again, Montana conjured a comeback, guiding the club to a 28\u201320 victory. The Chiefs playoff journey ended as the club made its initial [[AFC Championship Game]] appearance at Buffalo on January 23. Montana was knocked out of the contest early in the second half as Buffalo claimed its record fourth straight AFC title by a score of 30\u201313.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1994====\n{{Further|1994 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nWhile the previous off-season saw the Chiefs stockpile several key free agents, a number of familiar faces departed following the 1993 season, most notably cornerbacks Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross, as well as placekicker Nick Lowery. Quarterback [[Steve Bono]] was acquired in a trade with San Francisco on May 2 to serve as Joe Montana's backup, a job he previously held when both were with the 49ers. A grass playing field was installed at Arrowhead Stadium, replacing the previous [[AstroTurf]] surface. The club made its second American Bowl appearance in the pre-season, meeting [[1994 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn September 11, [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] came to Arrowhead to play against Joe Montana and the Chiefs in a highly anticipated matchup.

Montana orchestrated a masterful comeback, connecting with WR Willie Davis for a five-yard TD with 0:08 remaining to give the Chiefs a 31\u201328 triumph. A late-season, three-game losing skid put the club's playoff hopes in jeopardy. The Chiefs found themselves at 8\u20137 faced with a do-or-die regular season finale against the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] in the final NFL contest (to date) played at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] and in Los Angeles until 2016.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Marcus Allen had his finest game as a Chief, ironically against his former team, rushing 33 times for 132 yards en route to a 19\u20139 win. At 9\u20137, Kansas City qualified for the playoffs for a fifth straight season. However, the Chiefs made a rapid departure from the playoffs in Montana's final professional contest at Miami on [[New Year's Eve]]. Montana and Dolphins' quarterback Dan Marino conducted a masterful first-half duel that ended deadlocked at 17\u201317, but [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] eventually prevailed by a 27\u201317 count.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1995====\n{{Further|1995 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nJoe Montana announced his retirement from football after 16 years in the NFL on April 18 and Steve Bono was promoted to the starting job.

The Chiefs led the NFL in rushing offense (138.9 ypg), scoring defense (15.1 ppg) and turnover ratio (+12). A 24\u20133 win at Arizona on October 1 featured a surreal, 76-yard TD run on a bootleg by Bono as the Chiefs initiated a seven-game winning streak, the franchise's longest since 1969. In a ''Monday Night Football'' classic against [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on October 9, wide receiver [[Tamarick Vanover]] returned a punt for an 86-yard TD to provide the winning points in a 29\u201323 victory, the team's third straight home win in overtime.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThe club's defense began to flex its muscle, beginning with a 21\u20137 win at Denver on October 22. The contest, played in a Rocky Mountain snowstorm, featured the 100th rushing TD of Marcus Allen's career. The Chiefs won a home game for the third time on a last-second return score that concluded in Arrowhead's west end zone when cornerback [[Mark Collins (American football)|Mark Collins]] scooped up a fumble for a 20\u201313 win against [[1995 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Kansas City clinched a division title with a 29\u201323 victory at [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on December 3 en route to a franchise-best 13\u20133 regular season record and a team-record sixth consecutive postseason berth. The Chiefs were represented by seven players in the Pro Bowl, more than any other AFC team.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> In the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the underdog [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] on January 7\u2014a blustery afternoon with the temperature at 11 degrees and a wind chill of \u22129. Three interceptions and three missed field goals from placekicker [[Lin Elliot]] contributed to the 10\u20137 loss at Arrowhead.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1996====\n{{Further|1996 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City entered the 1996 campaign with essentially the same lineup as the club boasted in 1995 and were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' along with Green Bay as pre-season Super Bowl favorites. Kansas City made its third American Bowl appearance, this time against [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. The club started the season with a 4\u20130 record for the first time in team history, but the season's lofty expectations came crashing down as the squad lost three of its next four games. A three-game winning streak, including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl champion]] [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], put the club back in post-season contention at 8\u20133.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThat rosy picture quickly crumbled in a 28\u201314 loss against San Diego on November 24 as Steve Bono was relieved in the second half by back-up quarterback [[Rich Gannon]]. Gannon assumed the starting reins for a 28\u201324 win in a Thanksgiving Day game at [[1996 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] as Marcus Allen registered his 111th career rushing TD to surpass [[Walter Payton]] as the NFL's all-time leader in that department, a mark that was later broken by [[Emmitt Smith]]. Needing just one more win to qualify for the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped their next two games as an injury-hampered Gannon was sidelined for good in the second quarter of a 24\u201319 loss against [[1996 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]]. Faced with a must-win situation in a frigid regular season finale at Buffalo, the club's post-season hopes hinged on Bono. Despite a 20\u20139 loss to the [[1996 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]], the Chiefs still had a shot to slip into the playoffs if Atlanta could secure a win at Jacksonville. However, Atlanta placekicker [[Morten Andersen]]'s 30-yard field goal attempt went wide left with 0:04 remaining, preserving a 19\u201317 win and the AFC's final Wild Card spot for the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], who won a tiebreaker with Kansas City. The Chiefs finished with a 9\u20137 record, missing the postseason for the first time since 1989.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1997====\n{{Further|1997 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City dramatically retooled its roster in 1997, beginning with the signing of free agent quarterback Elvis Grbac on March 17. In addition to Grbac, the Chiefs lineup featured 11 new starters, including wide receiver [[Andre Rison]], who won team MVP honors after becoming the club's first Pro Bowl receiver in a decade. On defense, the club's top four picks from the 1996 Draft, safeties [[Jerome Woods]] and [[Reggie Tongue]], defensive end [[John Browning (American football)|John Browning]] and linebacker [[Donnie Edwards]], all emerged as starters.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nTackle [[John Alt]] announced his retirement at training camp in River Falls, Wisconsin on July 21. All the new faces quickly formed a cohesive unit as the Chiefs posted a 13\u20133 record, an 8\u20130 Arrowhead record and their second AFC West title in three years. The club engineered several dramatic finishes, the first of which came in a ''Monday Night Football'' thriller at Oakland on September 8 when Elvis Grbac connected with Andre Rison on an improbable 32-yard TD pass with just 0:03 remaining to cap a 28\u201327 win. Six days later, Kansas City's defense produced a remarkable goal-line stand to preserve a 22\u201316 victory at Arrowhead vs. [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After posting a 6\u20132 record during the season's first half, Kansas City's good fortune appeared to run out against Pittsburgh when Grbac suffered a broken clavicle. However, Rich Gannon led the team to a 5\u20131 mark in their next six outings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nPlacekicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]] provided one of the year's most memorable moments, connecting on a line-drive 54-yard field as time expired to give Kansas City a 24\u201322 win against Denver on November 16. [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] entered Arrowhead boasting an 11-game winning streak, the team departed after suffering a 44\u20139 defeat. The Chiefs' vaunted defensive unit pitched a 30\u20130 shutout vs. Oakland on December 7. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring defense, allowing a mere 14.5 points per game. The 232 total points permitted by the Chiefs in 1997 were the lowest tally ever allowed in a 16-game season in team history. Kansas City also broke a 63-year-old mark owned by the [[1934 NFL season|1934]] [[1934 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] by not permitting a second-half TD in 10 consecutive games. Grbac returned for the regular season finale against [[1997 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]] on December 21 as the squad finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history.\n\nThe Chiefs' 13\u20133 record gave them home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs. However, their playoff run was short-lived, as Kansas City lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 14\u201310 in the Divisional round.\n\n====1998====\n{{details|1998 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7\u20139 in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching (\"[[Martyball]]\"), and resigned following the 1998 season.\n\n====1999====\n{{details|topic=1999 Kansas City Chiefs season|1999 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nSchottenheimer left as head coach, replaced by his defensive coach [[Gunther Cunningham]]. In two years, Cunningham showed little improvement, going 9\u20137 and 7\u20139. After the loss of [[Derrick Thomas]], the collapse of the defense was unmistakable. The Chiefs' wins were mostly made by a high scoring offense rather than a powerful defense.\n\n==The Chiefs in the 21st century==\n\n===An explosive offense, 2001\u20132005===\n\n====2001====\n{{details|topic=2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|2001 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAfter coaching the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Rams]] to the [[Super Bowl]] and retiring, [[Dick Vermeil]] was lured out of retirement and took over as head coach in [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. It was noted that Vermeil would have the team ready for the Super Bowl \"within three years\", while in fact Vermeil would stay in Kansas City for the next five.\n\nThe first move the team made was forced after quarterback Elvis Grbac voided his contract, forgoing an $11 million bonus, leaving to lead the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl champion]] [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Vermeil replaced him with his primary pick for the Rams' quarterback, [[Trent Green]].\n\nAnother notable replacement was [[Priest Holmes]] at running back, who had served as back-up to Baltimore's [[Jamal Lewis]] in their Super Bowl season. Additions to the offensive line, including left tackle [[Willie Roaf]] from New Orleans, [[Casey Wiegmann]] at center, Brian Waters at guard, and [[John Welbourn]] from Philadelphia helped create the Chiefs' high powered offense. Holmes would go on to break [[Marshall Faulk]]'s record of 26 touchdowns in a season on December 27, 2003.\n\nVermeil brought many elements of \"[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\" from St. Louis to Kansas City's own offense, but much like the Schottenheimer era in the 1990s, the offense didn't win any playoff games.\n\n====2003====\n{{Main|2003 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs went 13\u20133 in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and their offense, considered by many as one of the most powerful of all time, helped make Kansas City again a favorite to win [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. After starting 9\u20130, the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in their tenth game following a \"guarantee\" by Bengals wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]]. The Chiefs' dream season of 2003 began to lose momentum by November, but they still managed to gain the number two seed in the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|2004 playoffs]]. The mighty homefield advantage of Arrowhead Stadium and their high-powered offense wouldn't lead the Chiefs to glory and the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoffs in an offensive shootout in which neither team punted, an NFL playoffs first. The Chiefs' defense came under fire immediately after the loss, and [[Greg Robinson (American football coach)|Greg Robinson]], the team's defensive coordinator, resigned after the season.\n\n====2004====\n{{Main|2004 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAs with the loss to the Broncos in 1997, this loss led to a poor following season. The Chiefs managed to finish the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 7\u20139 record. In 2004, Gunther Cunningham was brought back as the defensive coordinator. However, the defense showed little improvement. The offense, unable to record the same high scores as the previous year, was unable to bring in the wins as they had the previous year.\n\n[[File:Larry_Johnson_Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|Running back [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]]]]\n====2005====\n{{Main|2005 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nFor their 2005 campaign, the Chiefs brought in several new players to boost a defense that had finished among the worst units the past three years. The year also saw [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] start at running back in place of an injured [[Priest Holmes]]. But despite winning ten games, the Chiefs became just the fourth team in NFL history to go 10\u20136 and not reach the playoffs.\n\n===Rebuilding a contender, 2006\u20132012===\n\n====2006====\n{{Main|2006 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA tearful head coach [[Dick Vermeil]] announced his retirement before the final game of the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|2005 season]]. Within two weeks, then-[[New York Jets]] head coach [[Herman Edwards]] had signed a new 4-year contract to coach the Chiefs. The 2006 Chiefs returned to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, only to lose 23\u20138 in the Wild Card round against their playoff nemesis, the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs owner and founder [[Lamar Hunt]] died on December 13, 2006 due to complications brought on by a ten-year battle with [[prostate cancer]]. Hunt was remembered throughout the remainder of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] all throughout the NFL with moments of silence and ceremonies in Kansas City. Hunt's four children inherited ownership of the Chiefs. His oldest son, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], became chairman and CEO of the Chiefs, and the public face of the ownership group. He represents the Chiefs at owner meetings, and has the final say in team operations.\n[[File:Tony_Gonzalez_at_2005_Pro_Bowl_050213-N-3019M-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in 2005]]\n====2007====\n{{Main|2007 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs' 2007 off-season began with turmoil over the contract of [[Tony Gonzalez]], and the long-term career of [[Trent Green]] in Kansas City. Backup quarterback [[Damon Huard]] was signed to a three-year contract in February and Green was not only asked to restructure his contract but offered in trades to other teams.\n\nOn June 5, the Chiefs agreed to trade Green to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for a conditional fifth round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], pending a physical from Green.<ref name=\"Green goes to Dolphins\">Pasquarelli, Len.

Five different running backs were used after [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] was injured in week 9 against [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. The team also had no stability at quarterback with Huard and [[Brodie Croyle]], while their offensive line depleted in the absence of their former Pro Bowl guard [[Will Shields]].\n\nThe season ended with a nine-game losing streak, the team's first since [[1987 Kansas City Chiefs season|1987]], and a 4\u201312 record. It was the Chiefs' first season with 12 losses since [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]].\n\nHead coach Herman Edwards continued to build upon the Chiefs' roster with young players, mostly on defense, and attempted stabilize a once record-setting offensive line.<ref name=\"Transition\"/> The Chiefs continue to rebuild a defense that may quietly creep its way back to respectability.<ref name=\"Transition\">Teicher, Adam.

Other than that, there was little else of note about the season, which saw Kansas City fall to a franchise-worst 2\u201314 record.\n\nDuring the next offseason, the team made news by acquiring quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] (who had filled in for Brady during the previous year) and veteran linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] from New England for a second-round draft pick, which was used to obtain LSU defensive end [[Tyson Jackson]]. The Chiefs were also awarded the 256th and last player in the draft for the first time since 1970, South Carolina kicker [[Ryan Succop]]. Also, [[Scott Pioli]] was hired as general manager, yet another acquisition from New England.\n\nThere was little apparent sign of improvement as the Chiefs began 2009 by losing five games in a row before a victory over the Washington Redskins in Week 6. However, the team did manage to inflict an overtime defeat on the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 11, and closed out the year with a 4\u201312 record by overpowering Denver and preventing the Broncos from going to the playoffs. In that game, second-year running back [[Jamaal Charles]] set a franchise record by rushing for 259 yards.\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a 3\u20130 start in 2010, first by beating San Diego 21\u201314 on ''Monday Night Football''. This was their first MNF win in a decade, in addition to their first home win over the Chargers since 2006. They followed up the next week with a 16\u201314 win in Cleveland, followed by a 31\u201310 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers at home. The Chiefs entered their bye week as the only remaining undefeated team, but as most experts predicted, fell to Indianapolis 19\u20139 in Week 5. They lost a close game with the Houston Texans (35\u201331) in Week 6, beat Jacksonville in Week 7, and then won a razor-thin game against the winless Buffalo Bills. After going into overtime with a 10\u201310 score, neither team was able to score anything until Ryan Succop kicked a 35-yard field goal just as the clock reached 0:00 and avoiding a tie. Then came losses to Oakland and Denver, three straight wins over Seattle, Arizona, and Denver, a loss in San Diego, and wins over St. Louis and Tennessee. Losing the final game at home versus Oakland, the Chiefs finished 10\u20136 and won their first division title since 2003. However, the team's lack of postseason experience showed up as they were buried 30\u20137 by the Baltimore Ravens in the wild card round of the playoffs.\n\nKansas City began 2011 by losing its first three games, including blowout losses at home against Buffalo and at Detroit, where the Chiefs lost Jamaal Charles for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL. However, the Chiefs were able to rebound from the slow start, winning their next four contests, including a thrilling overtime victory over San Diego on ''Monday Night Football''. Unfortunately, the Chiefs would lose all momentum the following week when they were stunned at Arrowhead by the winless Miami Dolphins, losing quarterback Matt Cassel for the season with a hand injury. After losing four of the next five, the Chiefs fired head coach Todd Haley less than one year removed from a division title. With interim head coach [[Romeo Crennel]] and recently acquired quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] at the helm, the Chiefs were able to knock off then-undefeated Green Bay, and at 6\u20138, still had a shot at the division crown. The Chiefs would fall just short, however, losing 16\u201313 in overtime to arch-rival Oakland. The Chiefs would finish the 2011 season with a road win versus eventual AFC West champion Denver, finishing the season at 7\u20139.\n\nThe Chiefs hit rock bottom in 2012, with a passing game that was one of the worst of all time. Cassel was benched twice in favor of [[Brady Quinn]], but neither quarterback could perform well enough to win more than one game each. Despite having a roster that produced five Pro Bowlers and a 1,500-yard rushing season from Charles, the Chiefs stumbled to a 1\u20139 record.\n\nKansas City's 2012 season took a tragic and bizarre turn on December 1 when linebacker [[Jovan Belcher]] murdered his girlfriend in an argument. He then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he got into a confrontation with Crennel and several other Chiefs employees in the parking lot. They attempted to calm him down, after which Belcher thanked them and immediately shot himself dead.\n\nWith the team scheduled to play against Carolina the next day, there was considerable controversy as to whether the game should go on, but in the end it was decided not to move or cancel it. In a half-empty stadium, the Chiefs won the emotional match 27\u201321.\n\nAfter the Chiefs' victory over Carolina, the team did not win again in the 2012 season, only averaging 5.75 points per game in their final four games,<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/2012.htm</ref> and finished the season on a four-game losing streak and with a 2\u201314 record on the season.\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, both head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager [[Scott Pioli]] were fired from their positions. On January 4, the Chiefs signed former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] head coach [[Andy Reid]], who had been fired after coaching the Eagles for the past fourteen years, and on January 13 of the same year the Chiefs hired [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] to be their general manager.\n\n===The Andy Reid era, 2013\u2013present===\n\n====2013====\n\n{{details|2013 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, due to their 2\u201314 record in the season prior, received the #1 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], which was the first time in franchise history that team had the #1 pick in the NFL Draft that was not acquired in a transaction. However, about eight weeks prior to their first selection in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Chiefs traded for quarterback [[Alex Smith]], who the year prior had been benched in favor of [[Colin Kaepernick]] on the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Chiefs were able to acquire Smith by trading their second round picks in 2013 and 2014. While this move did end up bringing the quarterback for the Chiefs for the next five years to Kansas City, the selection was only supported by a plurality of Chiefs fans<ref>http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2013/2/27/4036414/alex-smith-trade-approval-poll-chiefs-trade-49ers</ref> at the time of the trade. After an offseason that brought players such as [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]] and [[Geoff Schwartz]], the Chiefs selected [[Eric Fisher (American football)|Eric Fisher]] with the first pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, as well as selecting future four time Pro Bowler [[Travis Kelce]] in the third round of the same draft. In the 2013 season, the Chiefs started the season with an incredible start, tying the 2003 team as the best start in franchise history and being the last team undefeated in the 2013 season, starting out with a 9\u20130 record. However, due a more difficult second half of the Chiefs schedule and somewhat of a regression by the Chiefs defense, the team faltered down the stretch, going 2\u20135 in their final seven games.\n\nEven though the team struggled near the end of the season, the Chiefs still clinched a playoff berth as a wildcard and played the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the first round of the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs]]. It seemed that the Chiefs would be able to win their first playoff game in twenty years and go on to the Divisional Round, but even though the Chiefs took a 38\u201310 lead in the early portion of the third quarter, the Chiefs were unable to contain the Colts offense and lost the game by only one point, 45\u201344.<ref>https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2014/1/4/5274372/chiefs-colts-final-score-kc-blows-28-point-lead-lose-in-wild-card</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric_Berry.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Safety [[Eric Berry]] was an integral part of the Chiefs defense in the 2010s]]\n====2014====\n\n{{details|2014 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2014 season, the Chiefs had the twenty-second pick in the [[2014 NFL Draft]], and selected linebacker [[Dee Ford]] out of Alabama, as well as future starting right guard [[Laurent Duvernay-Tardif]] with the 200th pick of the same draft.\n\nUnlike the 2013 season, the Chiefs were unable to get out to a good start on the year, as the Chiefs lost their first two and three out of their first five games. However, after a bye week in week 6, the Chiefs went on a tear, as they won their next five games, dominating the St. Louis Rams and the New York Jets, as well as beating the eventual Super Bowl participant Seattle Seahawks to put the team at a 7\u20133 record after ten games.\n\nHowever, disaster struck as the team suffered a devastating loss to the winless 0\u201310 [[Oakland Raiders]], who were able to upset the Chiefs on [[Thursday Night Football]]. This led to a three-game losing streak, which put the Chiefs at 7\u20136 on the season and desperately needing to win out for a chance to play in the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. This did not occur, as the Chiefs lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in Week 16 and eventually missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record.\n\n====2015====\n\n{{details|2015 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2015 season, the Chiefs had the eighteenth pick in the [[2015 NFL Draft]], and selected cornerback [[Marcus Peters]] out of Washington, who would become the eventual Defensive Rookie of the Year and a two time Pro Bowler for the Kansas City Chiefs. In the same draft, the Chiefs also selected future starters such as [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], and [[Steven Nelson]].\n\nWhile the Chiefs were able to win their first game against the [[Houston Texans]] and in their second game of the season, they held a 24\u201317 lead with only two minutes to play against the [[Denver Broncos]], who had won the past four [[AFC West]] championships, the Chiefs allowed a touchdown and then fumbled with less than thirty seconds remaining, sealing a victory for the Broncos. This loss was the first of five consecutive losses, and the team seemed to be spiraling out of control with a record of 1\u20135.\n\nThankfully for the Chiefs, the team overall began to play better and began an extremely improbable eleven game winning streak, beating the eventual Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos in their third game of the streak, and this streak was able to give the Chiefs the push they needed to make the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs]], as they clinched in Week 16, and even had a chance to win the AFC West in Week 17 if the Broncos lost and the Chiefs won. While the Chiefs were able to beat the [[Oakland Raiders]] and uphold their end of the scenario, the [[San Diego Chargers]] fell short and were unable to beat the Denver Broncos, and the Broncos clinched the division and home-field throughout the AFC Playoffs.\n\nIn the Chiefs first game of the postseason, they matched up against the 9\u20137 Houston Texans, and after a 22-year drought, the Chiefs were finally able to win a playoff game as the Chiefs walloped the Texans 30\u20130. This victory was the first time the Chiefs had won a playoff game since 1993, and gave the Chiefs the chance to make the AFC Championship Game for only the second time in team history, if they could beat the [[New England Patriots]] on the road. The Chiefs were unable to beat the Patriots, as injuries and losing the turnover battle sealed the loss for the Chiefs, and they were unable to beat the Patriots and lost 27\u201320 in the divisional round.\n \nOne notable achievement during this season was the first award given to the Chiefs in the Andy Reid era, as Marcus Peters won the Defensive Rookie of the Year award, and Eric Berry also won the Comeback Player of the Year award after beating his battle with cancer and playing well with the Chiefs in his first year after his treatment.\n\n====2016====\n\n{{details|2016 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2016 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs traded back out of the first round and instead drafted with the 37th pick in the draft, and used this selection to draft [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)|Chris Jones]]. As well as drafting Chris Jones, the Chiefs selected eventual three-time Pro Bowler [[Tyreek Hill]] in the fifth round of the same draft.\n\nThe Chiefs start to the season was no more than mediocre, and the before their bye week the Chiefs were destroyed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 43\u201314, which put the Chiefs on 2\u20132 for the year. After the bye week, however, the Chiefs won their next five games and were sitting at 7\u20132 on the season until an upset occurred as the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were able to eek out a two-point victory against the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], as the Bucs won 19\u201317. The Chiefs experienced an almost identical game against another team that missed the postseason, losing 19\u201317 to the [[Tennessee Titans]] at home. This loss put the Chiefs at 10\u20134 and the dream of a division title was in jeopardy. Heading into Week 17, the Chiefs were 11\u20134 and their rival, the [[Oakland Raiders]], were 12\u20133 but the Raiders did not have the tiebreaker on the Chiefs. In order for the Chiefs to clinch the division, similar to the 2015 season, the Chiefs needed a win and the division leader to lose. Unlike 2015, however, the division leader lost as the Oakland Raiders were unable to start their quarterback, [[Derek Carr]] due to an injury and the Raiders lost to the Broncos. The Chiefs were able to pick up a crucial victory over the [[San Diego Chargers]] (which would also be their final game in San Diego) and clinch the division and a first-round bye.\n\nHeading into the [[2016-17 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were 12\u20134 and claimed the second seed in the AFC. After the Pittsburgh Steelers were able to defeat the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wildcard Round, it was confirmed that the Chiefs would have to play the same team that beat them by 29 points fifteen weeks prior. While the Chiefs were able to hold Pittsburgh from scoring any touchdowns in their divisional round game, the Chiefs were only able to put up sixteen points of offense and the Steelers' six field goals were enough to put the Steelers into the AFC Championship Game and once again give a devastating playoff loss to the franchise.\n\n====2017====\n\n{{details|2017 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2017 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs decided to trade up into the draft, giving up their first round selections in 2017 and 2018 as well as their third round pick in 2017 in order to move up to #10 in the draft. With this selection, the Chiefs selected [[Patrick Mahomes]], their first quarterback drafted in the first round since 1983. While Mahomes would only start one game in the 2017 season, he was pegged to become the future of the franchise as the Chiefs had to trade a significant amount of draft capital in order to secure the quarterback. As well, during the offseason [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] was fired and [[Brett Veach]] was promoted to become the Chiefs next general manager.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to start the season strong, and after five games the Chiefs were 5\u20130 on the season. However, the Chiefs were unable to keep the winning streak alive and instead started a streak in the other direction, losing six of seven and four in a row. This put the Chiefs at 6\u20136 on the season and they desperately needed a win against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] to put themselves in a good position to win back to back AFC West titles. The Chiefs were able to beat the Chargers and move to 7\u20136. The Chiefs were able to win their next two games and clinch the [[AFC West]] in Week 16, which was the first time in team history that they had won consecutive division titles. With the Chiefs being locked into the #4 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs rested most of their starters and Patrick Mahomes started his first game of his career. While his numbers were not incredibly impressive, he showed raw talent with several impressive throws. He was also able to win this game, and the Chiefs finished the year at 10\u20136 and with the #4 seed in the AFC.\n\nIn the [[2017\u201318 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were matched up with the 9\u20137 [[Tennessee Titans]], led by [[Marcus Mariota]]. The Chiefs were able to get out to an early 21\u20133 lead, but the offense and defense faltered down the stretch and the Chiefs lost another close playoff game as the final score was 22\u201321 Titans. One bright spot for the team was rookie sensation [[Kareem Hunt]], who led the NFL in rushing yards and was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as being named Co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, along with [[Alvin Kamara]].\n\n[[File:Patrick Mahomes II.JPG|right|thumb|Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs starting quarterback since 2018, has broken numerous passing records and garnered an MVP award]]\n====2018====\n\n{{details|2018 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the same month as the playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans, a trade was announced between the Chiefs and the [[Washington Redskins]], and after five years of starting at least fifteen games in each year, [[Alex Smith]] was traded to the Redskins. In return, the Chiefs received [[Kendall Fuller]] and a third-round pick.\n\nIn the [[2018 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs did not have a first-round selection due to their trade to acquire the selection to draft [[Patrick Mahomes]], but they traded up to select [[Breeland Speaks]] in the second round of the NFL Draft. This draft also demonstrated the emphasis on improving the defense as the Chiefs only selected defensive players in the draft.\n\nIdentically to 2017, the Chiefs started out the season 5\u20130 and then lost their following game to an AFC juggernaut, this time to the [[New England Patriots]] in primetime. During this stretch, Patrick Mahomes threw ten touchdown passes in his first two games and four more over the next three. This was the start of an incredible campaign for the 23-year-old, as he finished the season with over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, being the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat, only behind [[Peyton Manning]]. After the Chiefs fell to the Patriots, they then won their next four to sit at 9\u20131 heading into their game against the also 9\u20131 [[Los Angeles Rams]]. While Patrick Mahomes threw six touchdown passes and led his team to over 50 points, he also had five turnovers and the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to lose a game while also scoring 50 points or more, as the Chiefs lost 54\u201351. The Chiefs then won their next two games to clinch a playoff berth in Week 14 as they were able to beat the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in overtime and sit at 11\u20132 on the season. Only needing a victory to secure a first-round bye and a third consecutive [[AFC West]] title, the Chiefs fell short against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and fell to 11\u20133 on the season as they lost 29\u201328. After the Chargers lost the following Saturday to the Baltimore Ravens and the [[Houston Texans]] lost to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the Chiefs only needed to beat the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC and an AFC West title. The Chiefs, however, fell short and lost 38\u201331. Now sitting at 11\u20134 and only needing to beat the Oakland Raiders to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC but also having the risk of falling all the way to the #5 seed, the Chiefs walloped the 4\u201311 [[Oakland Raiders]] 35\u20133, and clinched their third consecutive AFC West title and the #1 seed in the AFC for the first time since 1997.\n\nHeading into the [[2018\u201319 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were sitting at 12\u20134 and were the #1 seed in the AFC. After the Indianapolis Colts were able to beat the Houston Texans on the road, the Colts came to Kansas City to play the Chiefs in a divisional round matchup. The Colts to this point were 4\u20130 against the Chiefs in the playoffs and had given them plenty of trouble in the past. However, the Chiefs continued their stellar season with an impressive victory over the Colts, as the Chiefs won 31\u201313 and did not falter down the stretch like some of their previous postseason games in the Andy Reid era. This win came on a combination of four rushing touchdowns and a defense that only allowed six points, as the other seven came on a blocked punt that was recovered for a touchdown. With this victory, the Chiefs were able to host the [[AFC Championship Game]] for the first time in team history, and this was the first time ever that Kansas City had hosted a conference championship or a championship game in the AFL or NFL. After the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers, the matchup was set: Patriots at Chiefs for the AFC Championship.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs started out slow and were shut out in the first half, and the Patriots were leading 14\u20130. By the fourth quarter, however, the Chiefs were winning 21\u201317. The teams traded blows during the fourth quarter, where the two teams combined to score 38 points in the quarter. Down 31\u201328 with one timeout and only thirty-nine seconds to go, the Chiefs were able to drive down the field and kick a field goal to send the game into overtime. However, the Chiefs did not win the coin toss and the Patriots received the ball to begin overtime. The Chiefs were able to get the Patriots into three 3rd down and 10 to go situations, however the Patriots converted on all of them and eventually scored a touchdown to win the game by a score of 37\u201331. It was the third consecutive year where the Chiefs had lost a playoff game by six points or less.\n\nThe 2018 Chiefs also became the first team in NFL history to score at least 26 points in all of their games.\n\n====2019====\n{{details|2019 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nHeading into the 2019 offseason, the Chiefs had many key players that they cut, traded, or allowed to become free agents. Some of these players included [[Dee Ford]] (traded after being franchise tagged), [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], Allen Bailey, Justin Houston, Eric Berry, and more. The Chiefs also had to find a new defensive coordinator after the firing of [[Bob Sutton (American football)|Bob Sutton]] following the collapse against New England in the AFC Championship game. The Chiefs would hire [[Steve Spagnuolo]] as their defensive coordinator on January 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001013167/article/chiefs-hire-steve-spagnuolo-as-defensive-coordinator|title=Chiefs hire Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=January 24, 2019|accessdate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKansas City enjoyed a 4\u20130 start before losing to the [[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]].

They once again found themselves behind early as Tennessee took a 10\u20130 lead, but Kansas City took the lead by halftime, thanks to two passing touchdowns from Mahomes to [[Tyreek Hill]] and a Mahomes touchdown run. The Chiefs ultimately won 35\u201324, avenging another regular season loss and clinching their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/afc-championship-2020-patrick-mahomes-helps-end-50-year-super-bowl-drought-for-chiefs-and-their-fans/ |title=AFC Championship 2020: Patrick Mahomes helps end 50-year Super Bowl drought for Chiefs and their fans |last=Dodd |first=Dennis |date=2020-01-19 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Chiefs quarterbacks==\n{{details|Kansas City Chiefs quarterbacks}}\nThroughout the Chiefs' near five-decade existence, there have been 12 starting quarterbacks to lead the team. Among the most prolific include [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Len Dawson]] and [[Joe Montana]], as well as quarterbacks like [[Trent Green]].\n\nIn the past few decades, the Chiefs have relied on veteran quarterbacks to lead their team.<ref name=\"Quarterback\">Gretz, Bob.

Since Kenney's retirement in [[1988 NFL season|1988]]. the Chiefs never drafted their own quarterback to develop until [[Brodie Croyle]],<ref name=\"Quarterback\"/> whom started some games in 2007 and 2008, was drafted in [[2006 NFL Draft|2006]].

For the 2007\u201308 school year, the district served more than 61,000 students. More than 80 languages and dialects are spoken by over 63,000 Elk Grove Unified students.\n\nThe district has 64 schools: 39 elementary schools, 9 middle schools, 9 high schools, 4 alternative education schools, an adult school, a special education school, and a [[charter school]].\n\nThe district is governed by a publicly elected seven-member Board of Education. District Superintendent [[Christopher R. Hoffman]], has served Elk Grove Unified since 2014. Mr. Hoffman is the sixth superintendent to serve the district since unification on July 1, 1959.\n\n==History==\nToday the Elk Grove Unified School District's boundaries cover {{convert|320|sqmi|km2}}, stretching almost from the Sacramento River to the foothills of Amador County.\n\nThe district is the result of the unification of smaller districts that date back to the 19th century.\n\nThe elementary school district known as \"Elk Grove\" was formed in 1866 and is one of the oldest in the state of California. The Elk Grove Union High School District followed almost 30 years later opening in 1892.\n\nThe unification of the Elk Grove district took place in 1959 under the leadership of County Superintendent T.R. Smedberg, a former superintendent of Elk Grove Union High School District. The elementary districts that unified with the high school district included: Elk Grove, Sierra-Enterprise, Franklin, Cosumnes, Dillard, Florin, and Pleasant Grove.\n\nElk Grove Unified has only had six superintendents in its 52-year history.\n*1959 to 1968 \u2013 George Kibby\n*1969 to 1983 \u2013 Glenn Houde\n*1983 to 1995 \u2013 Robert L.

For the 2007\u201308 school year, the district served more than 61,000 students. More than 80 languages and dialects are spoken by over 63,000 Elk Grove Unified students.\n\nThe district has 64 schools: 39 elementary schools, 9 middle schools, 9 high schools, 4 alternative education schools, an adult school, a special education school, and a [[charter school]].\n\nThe district is governed by a publicly elected seven-member Board of Education. District Superintendent [[Christopher R. Hoffman]], has served Elk Grove Unified since 2014. Mr. Hoffman is the sixth superintendent to serve the district since unification on July 1, 1959.\n\n==History==\nToday the Elk Grove Unified School District's boundaries cover {{convert|320|sqmi|km2}}, stretching almost from the Sacramento River to the foothills of Amador County.\n\nThe district is the result of the unification of smaller districts that date back to the 19th century.\n\nThe elementary school district known as \"Elk Grove\" was formed in 1866 and is one of the oldest in the state of California. The Elk Grove Union High School District followed almost 30 years later opening in 1892.\n\nThe unification of the Elk Grove district took place in 1959 under the leadership of County Superintendent T.R. Smedberg, a former superintendent of Elk Grove Union High School District. The elementary districts that unified with the high school district included: Elk Grove, Sierra-Enterprise, Franklin, Cosumnes, Dillard, Florin, and Pleasant Grove.\n\nElk Grove Unified has only had six superintendents in its 52-year history.\n*1959 to 1968 \u2013 George Kibby\n*1969 to 1983 \u2013 Glenn Houde\n*1983 to 1995 \u2013 Robert L.
