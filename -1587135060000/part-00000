For instance the town of [[Buta]] gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes where still not operational.{{Sfn|Okonda|2019}}\n\n== Subdivision count ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2018 Subdivision count by administrative level<ref>Level 1\u20134 tabulated from data found at [[#{{SfnRef|CENI maps}}|CENI maps]]; level 5 from [[#{{SfnRef|CENI 2017}}|CENI 2017]], p. 55, Tableau 10</ref>\n|-\n!

The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections.  Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table.

This was promoted by [[Eastern Air Lines]], led by then chairman [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] who wanted to make RDU a stop on the airline's New York\u2013Miami route.\n\nThe new Raleigh\u2013Durham Airport opened on May 1, 1943 with flights by Eastern Airlines. The passenger terminal was built from materials remaining after the construction of four barracks for the Army Air Forces Air Technical Service Command airfield.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuck at the Airport: Raleigh\u2013Durham \u2013 Haven for Bibliophiles at RDU|first=Harriet|last=Baskas|url=http://www.expedia.com/daily/airports/Raleigh-Durham.asp|publisher=[[Expedia.com]]|date=October 11, 2004|accessdate=September 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805151105/http://www.expedia.com/daily/airports/Raleigh-Durham.asp|archivedate=August 5, 2002|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The three runways the airport had in 1951 are still visible on the southeast side of the airport: 4500-ft runway 5, 4500-ft runway 18 and 4490-ft runway 14.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] joined Eastern at RDU; [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] arrived in 1948.

Nonstop flights did not reach beyond Washington, Atlanta, or the Appalachians (but Eastern started a Super Constellation nonstop to Newark in 1958). The next airline (aside from United's takeover of Capital in 1961) was [[Delta Air Lines]] in 1970. In April 1969 nonstops didn't reach beyond New York or Atlanta, and Chicago was the only nonstop west of the Appalachians.

Terminal A was renamed Terminal 1 on October 26, 2008 to bring RDU in line with terminal naming conventions and to end years of confusion.\n\nAfter years of proposals, the 1981 part of Terminal 1 was closed in 2012 for a complete renovation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4435772/|title=RDU could shutter terminal|date=January 30, 2009|work=WRAL|access-date=January 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203023512/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4435772|archive-date=February 3, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[AirTran Airways]] continued to operate out of the pre-1981 part of Terminal 1.

In planning the terminal, American assumed that only around 20% of passengers would originate or terminate their trips in Raleigh\u2013Durham; rather, Terminal C was optimized for the exchange of passengers between connecting flights, with a relatively small check-in and baggage claim area. In reality, connecting passengers only accounted for around two-thirds of the terminal's passengers. After the American and Midway hubs closed, the airport faced a decision about the future of Terminal C and how to eliminate the inconveniences it imposed on local passengers.<ref name=\"airportbusiness\">{{cite web|title=The RDU Experience: Phase 2 Expansion Culminates a Decade of Defining the Needs, the Costs|first=John F.|last=Infanger|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/print/Airport-Business-Magazine/The-RDU-Experience/1$36407|work=Airport Business|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221111/http://www.airportbusiness.com/print/Airport-Business-Magazine/The-RDU-Experience/1$36407|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2003 the Airport Authority announced plans to expand and renovate the {{convert|300000|sqft|abbr=on}} building, transforming it into a new {{convert|900000|sqft|abbr=on}} facility.

The North Cargo terminal area is used by cargo airlines. The largest cargo operators are FedEx and UPS. The South Cargo terminal area is used by commercial airlines for cargo operations.\n\n===Runways===\nRDU has three runways.

It was quickly outgrown, and in 1939 the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] chartered the Raleigh\u2013Durham Aeronautical Authority to build and operate a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham. This was promoted by [[Eastern Air Lines]], led by then chairman [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] who wanted to make RDU a stop on the airline's New York\u2013Miami route.\n\nThe new Raleigh\u2013Durham Airport opened on May 1, 1943 with flights by Eastern Airlines. The passenger terminal was built from materials remaining after the construction of four barracks for the Army Air Forces Air Technical Service Command airfield.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuck at the Airport: Raleigh\u2013Durham \u2013 Haven for Bibliophiles at RDU|first=Harriet|last=Baskas|url=http://www.expedia.com/daily/airports/Raleigh-Durham.asp|publisher=[[Expedia.com]]|date=October 11, 2004|accessdate=September 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805151105/http://www.expedia.com/daily/airports/Raleigh-Durham.asp|archivedate=August 5, 2002|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The three runways the airport had in 1951 are still visible on the southeast side of the airport: 4500-ft runway 5, 4500-ft runway 18 and 4490-ft runway 14.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] joined Eastern at RDU; [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] arrived in 1948. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 36 departures a day: twenty Eastern, eight Capital and eight Piedmont. Nonstop flights did not reach beyond Washington, Atlanta, or the Appalachians (but Eastern started a Super Constellation nonstop to Newark in 1958). The next airline (aside from United's takeover of Capital in 1961) was [[Delta Air Lines]] in 1970. In April 1969 nonstops didn't reach beyond New York or Atlanta, and Chicago was the only nonstop west of the Appalachians. RDU's first scheduled jets were Eastern 727s in 1965.\n\nIn the 1970s, the last decade before airline deregulation, Piedmont connected RDU to Charlotte, Greensboro, New Bern, Norfolk, Richmond, Rocky Mount, Washington, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departedflights.com/PI121578p22.html|title=PI121578p22|publisher=|access-date=August 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315163736/http://www.departedflights.com/PI121578p22.html|archive-date=March 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> United flew to Asheville, Charlotte, Huntsville and Newark,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departedflights.com/UA061176p80.html|title=UA061176p80|publisher=|access-date=August 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315163739/http://www.departedflights.com/UA061176p80.html|archive-date=March 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> while Eastern flew to Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Washington,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departedflights.com/EA090672p52.html|title=EA090672p52|publisher=|access-date=August 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315163114/http://www.departedflights.com/EA090672p52.html|archive-date=March 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and Delta flew to Chicago and Greensboro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departedflights.com/DL102774p69.html|title=DL102774p69|publisher=|access-date=August 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315163733/http://www.departedflights.com/DL102774p69.html|archive-date=March 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter deregulation [[Allegheny Airlines]] arrived in 1979 and by 1985 [[Trans World Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], Ozark, People Express, New York Air and Pan Am had all put in appearances.\n\n===Hub years===\n[[American Airlines|American]] built a terminal at RDU between 1985 and 1987 to house a new hub, and flew to 38 cities when the hub started in June 1987.<ref>{{cite news|last=Belden|first=Tom|title=American Begins Service To New Hub|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-04/business/26170409_1_new-nonstop-jet-service-durham-hub-american-eagle|accessdate=December 9, 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=August 4, 1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221541/http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-04/business/26170409_1_new-nonstop-jet-service-durham-hub-american-eagle|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The December 1987 timetable shows AA nonstops to 36 airports and Eagle prop nonstops to 18 more.
