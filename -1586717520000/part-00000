In her youth she learned folksongs in the traditional way (orally, from her family and members of her community); and in adulthood she became a successful modern folksinger, promulgating songs in public through concerts and recordings.  She was called by some the \"Mother of Folk\".\n\n==Out of Kentucky==\nJean Ritchie was born to Abigail (n\u00e9e Hall) and Balis W. Ritchie of [[Viper, Kentucky|Viper]], an unincorporated community in [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry County]] in the Cumberland Mountains of south eastern [[Kentucky]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The Ritchies of Perry County were one of the two \"great ballad-singing families\" of Kentucky celebrated among folk song scholars (the other was the Combs family of adjacent [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott County]], whose repertoire formed the basis of the first scholarly work on the British ballads in America, a doctoral thesis by Professor Josiah Combs of [[Berea College]] for the Sorbonne University published in Paris in 1925.)<ref>[[Alan Lomax]], foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians as Sung by Jean Ritchie'', forewords by Alan Lomax and Ron Pen (University of Kentucky Press, 2nd edition, 1997). p. 1. The book by Combs, who was a specialist in the dulcimer, was translated into English as a monograph by [[D. K. Wilgus]] in 1967 as ''Folk-Songs of the Southern United States (Folk-Songs Du Midi Des Etats-Unis), Publications of the American Folklore Society, Bibliographical and Special Series, Vol. 19'' (University of Texas).</ref> In 1917, the folk music collector [[Cecil Sharp]] collected songs from Jean's older sisters Una and May. Many of the Ritchies attended the [[Hindman Settlement School]], a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled ''Lovers' Melodies'',<ref>Charles Wolfe and Jean Ritchie, foreword to new edition of Jean Ritchie, ''Jean Ritchie's Swapping Song Book'' with photographs by George Pickow (University of Kentucky Press, [1952] 2000), p. 1.</ref> and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.\n\nRitchie's forebears had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1776 before settling in Kentucky, and most of them later fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War. Her grandfather Justice Austin Ritchie was 2nd Lieutenant of Company C of the 13th Kentucky Confederate Cavalry. [[Alan Lomax]] wrote that:<blockquote>They were quiet, thoughtful folks, who went in for ballads, big families and educating their children. Jean's grandmother was a prime mover in the Old Regular Baptist Church, and all the traditional hymn tunes came from her. Jean's Uncle Jason was a lawyer, who remembers the big ballads like \"Lord Barnard.\" Jean's father taught school, printed a newspaper, fitted specs, farmed and sent ten of his fourteen children to college.<ref>Lomax, foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians'', p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the youngest of 14 siblings,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Ritchie was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house. She was quick to memorize songs and, with Chalmers and Velma McDaniels, performed at local dances and at county fairs, where they  repeatedly won blue ribbons in [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], the county seat. She recalled that when the family acquired a radio in the late 1940s they discovered that what they had been singing was [[hillbilly music]], a word they had never heard before.\n\nRitchie graduated from high school in Viper and enrolled in Cumberland Junior College (now a four-year [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], and from there graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a B.A. in [[social work]] from the [[University of Kentucky]], in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] in 1946.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> At college she participated in the [[glee club]] and [[choir]] and learned to play [[piano]].<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/jean-ritchie/biography Biography of Jean Ritchie], music.yahoo.com; accessed January 9, 2014.</ref> During World War II, she taught in elementary school. After graduating she got a job as a social worker at the [[Henry Street Settlement]], where she taught music to children.

The Brooklyn-born Pickow, who had studied painting at [[Cooper Union]] and made training films for the Navy in [[World War II]], had a long career as a professional photographer and filmmaker. His career also included an extensive documentation of his wife's work and his photographs illustrated many of her books. Pickow and Ritchie met in 1948 at a square dance at the [[Henry Street Settlement]]. The following day, Pickow invited her to accompany him on a photo shoot at the [[Fulton Fish Market]]. \"The result \u2014 Ms. Ritchie perched on the hood of a truck, holding a rather large lobster \u2014 was published in a trucking-industry magazine.\"<ref name=nytobitpickow>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/arts/design/19pickow.html\n| first = Margalit \n| last = Fox\n| title = George Pickow, Artist Who Chronicled Musical Life, Is Dead at 88\n| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n| date = 18 December 2010}}</ref> They married in 1950 and had two sons, Peter and Jon. In 1952, Pickow accompanied his wife on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]] to collect folk songs in Britain and Ireland. When Alan Lomax, then working out of London for the [[BBC]], and his collaborator [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]] of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]], decided to document the unique [['Obby 'Oss festival|May Eve and May Day Festivals]] at [[Padstow]] in [[Cornwall]], they selected Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute color film ''Oss Oss Wee Oss'' (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the [[Greenwich Village]] folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter [[Anna Lomax Wood]], edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass''. In addition to Ritchie, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass'' features what one reviewer called \"killer footage\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p08253.htm|title=FAME Review: Ballads, Blues, & Bluegrass - A Film by Alan Lomax (DVD)|website=Acousticmusic.com|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref> of performances by [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Peter La Farge]], [[Ernie Marrs]], [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Memphis Slim]], and the first known footage of a very young [[Doc Watson]].

The latter instrument is also called the \"mountain dulcimer\" and is distinct from the [[hammer dulcimer]]; it is an intimate indoor instrument with a soft, ethereal sound. Her father had played the Appalachian dulcimer but forbade his children to touch it. At the age of four or five, however, Ritchie defied this prohibition and picked out \"[[Go Tell Aunt Rhody]]\".\n\nBy 1949, Ritchie's playing of the Appalachian dulcimer had become a hallmark of her style. After her husband made one for her as a present, the couple decided there might be a potential market for them. Pickow's uncle, Morris Pickow, set up an instrument workshop for them under the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] in [[Brooklyn]]. At first they were shipped to New York in an unfinished state by Ritchie's Kentucky relative, Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. George did the finishing and Jean did the tuning and soon they had sold 300 dulcimers. Later they manufactured them themselves from start to finish, Today there are dulcimers for sale at most folk festivals. Because fans kept asking her \"Which album has the most dulcimer?\", she finally recorded an album called ''The Most Dulcimer'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=The most dulcimer [sound recording]|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/87752816|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The Fulbright expedition==\nJean Ritchie was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland.

In her youth she learned folksongs in the traditional way (orally, from her family and members of her community); and in adulthood she became a successful modern folksinger, promulgating songs in public through concerts and recordings.

Many of the Ritchies attended the [[Hindman Settlement School]], a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled ''Lovers' Melodies'',<ref>Charles Wolfe and Jean Ritchie, foreword to new edition of Jean Ritchie, ''Jean Ritchie's Swapping Song Book'' with photographs by George Pickow (University of Kentucky Press, [1952] 2000), p. 1.</ref> and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.\n\nRitchie's forebears had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1776 before settling in Kentucky, and most of them later fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War. Her grandfather Justice Austin Ritchie was 2nd Lieutenant of Company C of the 13th Kentucky Confederate Cavalry. [[Alan Lomax]] wrote that:<blockquote>They were quiet, thoughtful folks, who went in for ballads, big families and educating their children. Jean's grandmother was a prime mover in the Old Regular Baptist Church, and all the traditional hymn tunes came from her. Jean's Uncle Jason was a lawyer, who remembers the big ballads like \"Lord Barnard.\" Jean's father taught school, printed a newspaper, fitted specs, farmed and sent ten of his fourteen children to college.<ref>Lomax, foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians'', p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the youngest of 14 siblings,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Ritchie was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house. She was quick to memorize songs and, with Chalmers and Velma McDaniels, performed at local dances and at county fairs, where they  repeatedly won blue ribbons in [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], the county seat. She recalled that when the family acquired a radio in the late 1940s they discovered that what they had been singing was [[hillbilly music]], a word they had never heard before.\n\nRitchie graduated from high school in Viper and enrolled in Cumberland Junior College (now a four-year [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], and from there graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a B.A. in [[social work]] from the [[University of Kentucky]], in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] in 1946.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> At college she participated in the [[glee club]] and [[choir]] and learned to play [[piano]].<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/jean-ritchie/biography Biography of Jean Ritchie], music.yahoo.com; accessed January 9, 2014.</ref> During World War II, she taught in elementary school.

The Brooklyn-born Pickow, who had studied painting at [[Cooper Union]] and made training films for the Navy in [[World War II]], had a long career as a professional photographer and filmmaker. His career also included an extensive documentation of his wife's work and his photographs illustrated many of her books. Pickow and Ritchie met in 1948 at a square dance at the [[Henry Street Settlement]]. The following day, Pickow invited her to accompany him on a photo shoot at the [[Fulton Fish Market]]. \"The result \u2014 Ms. Ritchie perched on the hood of a truck, holding a rather large lobster \u2014 was published in a trucking-industry magazine.\"<ref name=nytobitpickow>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/arts/design/19pickow.html\n| first = Margalit \n| last = Fox\n| title = George Pickow, Artist Who Chronicled Musical Life, Is Dead at 88\n| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n| date = 18 December 2010}}</ref> They married in 1950 and had two sons, Peter and Jon. In 1952, Pickow accompanied his wife on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]] to collect folk songs in Britain and Ireland. When Alan Lomax, then working out of London for the [[BBC]], and his collaborator [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]] of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]], decided to document the unique [['Obby 'Oss festival|May Eve and May Day Festivals]] at [[Padstow]] in [[Cornwall]], they selected Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute color film ''Oss Oss Wee Oss'' (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the [[Greenwich Village]] folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter [[Anna Lomax Wood]], edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass''. In addition to Ritchie, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass'' features what one reviewer called \"killer footage\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p08253.htm|title=FAME Review: Ballads, Blues, & Bluegrass - A Film by Alan Lomax (DVD)|website=Acousticmusic.com|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref> of performances by [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Peter La Farge]], [[Ernie Marrs]], [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Memphis Slim]], and the first known footage of a very young [[Doc Watson]].

The latter instrument is also called the \"mountain dulcimer\" and is distinct from the [[hammer dulcimer]]; it is an intimate indoor instrument with a soft, ethereal sound. Her father had played the Appalachian dulcimer but forbade his children to touch it. At the age of four or five, however, Ritchie defied this prohibition and picked out \"[[Go Tell Aunt Rhody]]\".\n\nBy 1949, Ritchie's playing of the Appalachian dulcimer had become a hallmark of her style. After her husband made one for her as a present, the couple decided there might be a potential market for them. Pickow's uncle, Morris Pickow, set up an instrument workshop for them under the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] in [[Brooklyn]]. At first they were shipped to New York in an unfinished state by Ritchie's Kentucky relative, Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. George did the finishing and Jean did the tuning and soon they had sold 300 dulcimers. Later they manufactured them themselves from start to finish, Today there are dulcimers for sale at most folk festivals. Because fans kept asking her \"Which album has the most dulcimer?\", she finally recorded an album called ''The Most Dulcimer'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=The most dulcimer [sound recording]|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/87752816|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The Fulbright expedition==\nJean Ritchie was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland.

Ritchie's 50th anniversary album was ''Mountain Born'' (1995), which features her two sons, Peter and Jonathan Pickow. In 1954 Ritchie and George Pickow released some of their UK recordings under the name ''Field Trip''. It was re-issued in 2001 on the Greenhays label.

Jigglypuff is voiced by [[Rachael Lillis]] in English and by [[Mika Kanai]] in Japanese. In live action musical ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Live!]]'', Jigglypuff is portrayed by Leah Smith. Jigglypuff is also very well known for singing a lullaby in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series.\n\nKnown as the [[Balloon]] Pok\u00e9mon, Jigglypuff evolves from [[Igglybuff]] when it reaches a certain point of [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Friendship|happiness]], and evolves into [[Wigglytuff]] when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its English name is a combination of the words \"jiggly\" and \"puff\", intended to relate to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime series]] and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception.

Jigglypuff is a playable character in all five ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. It is the one of the two original representatives of the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' franchise in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series along with [[Pikachu]]. While Jigglypuff is referred as an \"it,\" Jigglypuff's alternate costumes in the series imply Jigglypuff is female. Despite not being a lead character in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise, game director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] selected it to appear due to its similarities to [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]], which allowed the staff to reuse the model and many animations as a base for Jigglypuff.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Interview with Masahiro Sakurai |author=Staff |journal=The 64Dream |year=1999 |issue=5}}</ref> Jigglypuff's moves in its ''Super Smash Bros.'' appearances are Sing, Rollout, Pound, and Rest.

When it realizes those who have been subject to its song have fallen asleep, it angrily uses the marker to draw on their faces.<ref name=mania/>\n\nDuring Jigglypuff's first appearance (\"The Song of Jigglypuff\"), it was found standing on a stump. [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] tried to capture it with the help of her [[Staryu]], but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] gave it a piece of fruit which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep.

While Jigglypuff is referred as an \"it,\" Jigglypuff's alternate costumes in the series imply Jigglypuff is female.

The birds were initially widespread, occurring from the northern to the southern tip of Madagascar.<ref name=\"Hawkins\" /> One theory states that humans hunted the elephant birds to extinction in a very short time for such a large landmass (the [[Quaternary extinction event#Overkill hypothesis|blitzkrieg hypothesis]]). There is indeed evidence that they were hunted and their preferred habitats destroyed. Eggs may have been particularly vulnerable. 19th-century travelers saw eggshells used as bowls, and a recent archaeological study found remains of eggshells among the remains of human fires,<ref name=\"Pearson\">Pearson and Godden (2002)</ref>{{r|ley196608}} suggesting that the eggs regularly provided meals for entire families.\n\nThe exact time period when they died out is also not certain; tales of these giant birds may have persisted for centuries in [[folk memory]].  There is archaeological evidence of ''Aepyornis'' from a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] bone at 1880&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;70&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]] (approximately 120&nbsp;[[Common era|CE]]) with signs of butchering, and on the basis of radiocarbon dating of shells, about 1000&nbsp;BP (approximately 1000&nbsp;CE).<ref name=\"Hawkins\" />\n\nAn alternative theory is that the extinction was a secondary effect of human impact resulting from transfer of [[Quaternary extinction event#Hyperdisease hypothesis|hyperdiseases]] from human [[commensal]]s such as [[chicken]]s and [[guineafowl]]. The bones of these domesticated fowl have been found in [[subfossil]] sites in the island (MacPhee and Marx, 1997: 188), such as Ambolisatra (Madagascar), where ''Mullerornis'' sp. and ''Aepyornis maximus'' have been reported.<ref>Goodman, S. M. & Rakotozafy, L. M. A. (1997)</ref> Also reported by these authors, ratite remains have been found in west and south west Madagascar, at Belo-sur-Mer (''A. medius'', ''Mullerornis rudis''), Bemafandry (''M. agilis'') and Lamboharana (''Mullerornis'' sp.).\n\nRecently human tool marks have been found on elephant bird bones dating to approximately 10,000 BCE.

The legend of the [[roc (mythology)|roc]] could also have originated from sightings of such a giant [[Malagasy crowned eagle|subfossil eagle]] related to the African [[crowned eagle]], which has been described in the genus ''[[Stephanoaetus]]'' from Madagascar,<ref>Goodman, S. M. (1994)</ref> being large enough to carry off large primates; today, [[lemur]]s still retain a fear of aerial predators such as these. Another might be the perception of ratites retaining [[neoteny|neotenic]] features and thus being mistaken for enormous chicks of a presumably more massive bird.\n\nThe ancient [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name for the bird is '''vorompatra''', meaning \"bird of the Ampatres\".

The birds were initially widespread, occurring from the northern to the southern tip of Madagascar.<ref name=\"Hawkins\" /> One theory states that humans hunted the elephant birds to extinction in a very short time for such a large landmass (the [[Quaternary extinction event#Overkill hypothesis|blitzkrieg hypothesis]]). There is indeed evidence that they were hunted and their preferred habitats destroyed. Eggs may have been particularly vulnerable. 19th-century travelers saw eggshells used as bowls, and a recent archaeological study found remains of eggshells among the remains of human fires,<ref name=\"Pearson\">Pearson and Godden (2002)</ref>{{r|ley196608}} suggesting that the eggs regularly provided meals for entire families.\n\nThe exact time period when they died out is also not certain; tales of these giant birds may have persisted for centuries in [[folk memory]].  There is archaeological evidence of ''Aepyornis'' from a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] bone at 1880&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;70&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]] (approximately 120&nbsp;[[Common era|CE]]) with signs of butchering, and on the basis of radiocarbon dating of shells, about 1000&nbsp;BP (approximately 1000&nbsp;CE).<ref name=\"Hawkins\" />\n\nAn alternative theory is that the extinction was a secondary effect of human impact resulting from transfer of [[Quaternary extinction event#Hyperdisease hypothesis|hyperdiseases]] from human [[commensal]]s such as [[chicken]]s and [[guineafowl]]. The bones of these domesticated fowl have been found in [[subfossil]] sites in the island (MacPhee and Marx, 1997: 188), such as Ambolisatra (Madagascar), where ''Mullerornis'' sp. and ''Aepyornis maximus'' have been reported.<ref>Goodman, S. M. & Rakotozafy, L. M. A. (1997)</ref> Also reported by these authors, ratite remains have been found in west and south west Madagascar, at Belo-sur-Mer (''A. medius'', ''Mullerornis rudis''), Bemafandry (''M. agilis'') and Lamboharana (''Mullerornis'' sp.).\n\nRecently human tool marks have been found on elephant bird bones dating to approximately 10,000 BCE. This not only vastly extends the range of human existence on Madagascar's prehistoric past, but suggests a more complex relationship between these birds and human beings and their eventual extinction, as they apparently coexisted for a massive period of time.<ref name=\"Hansford2018\">{{cite journal|last1= Hansford|first1= J.|last2= Wright|first2=P.

Increasingly accurate measurements were required, and scientists looked for measures that were universal and could be based on natural phenomena rather than royal decree or physical prototypes. Rather than the various complex systems of subdivision in use, they also preferred a decimal system to ease their calculations.\n\nWith the [[French Revolution]] (1789) came a desire to replace many features of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], including [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|the traditional units of measure]]. As a base unit of length, many scientists had favoured the [[seconds pendulum]] (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that it varied from place to place with local gravity and that it could complement [[History of geodesy|meridian arc measurements]] in determining the [[figure of the Earth]]. A new unit of length, the ''metre'' was introduced \u2013 defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator [[Paris meridian|passing through Paris]], assuming an Earth's [[flattening]] of 1/334.\n\nFor practical purposes however, the standard metre was made available in the form of a platinum bar held in Paris. This in turn was replaced in 1889 at the initiative of the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] by thirty platinum-iridium bars kept across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/international-metre-commission.html|title=BIPM - Commission internationale du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of a special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.<ref name=\"la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre\" /> Progress in science finally allowed to dematerialize the definition of the metre, so in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in krypton-86 allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement. In 1983 this was updated to a length defined in terms of the [[speed of light]], which was reworded in 2019:<ref name=2019metre>{{citation \n |title = 9th edition of the SI Brochure\n |publisher = [[BIPM]]\n |url = https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/\n |date = 2019\n |page=131\n |df = dmy-all\n }}</ref>\n\n:The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length.

France was particularly affected by the proliferation of length measures, and the need for reform was widely accepted across all political viewpoints, even if it needed the push of revolution to bring it about. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] resurrected the idea of the seconds pendulum before the Constituent Assembly in 1790, suggesting that the new measure be defined at 45\u00b0N (a latitude that, in France, runs just north of Bordeaux and just south of Grenoble): despite the support of the Assembly, nothing came of Talleyrand's proposal.<ref name=\"Larousse\"/><ref group=\"Note\">The idea of the [[seconds pendulum]] as a length standard did not die completely, and such a standard was used to define the [[yard]] in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 1878.</ref>\n\n==Meridional definition==\n{{see also|Earth's circumference#Historical use in the definition of units of measurement|Meridian arc#History of measurement}}\n<!-- \"Meridional definition\" links here -->\n[[File:Dunkerque Belfort.JPG|thumb|upright|Belfry, Dunkirk \u2013 the northern end of the [[meridian arc]]]]\n[[File:Reflecting circle-CnAM 1842-IMG 4998-gradient.jpg|left|thumb|[[Repeating circle]]]]\n\nThe question of measurement reform was placed in the hands of the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences]], who appointed a commission chaired by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]]. Borda was an avid supporter of [[decimalisation]]: he had invented the \"[[repeating circle]]\", a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in \"''[[grad (angle)|grade]]s''\" ({{frac|100}} of a quarter-circle) rather than [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, with 100&nbsp;minutes to a ''grade'' and 100&nbsp;seconds to a minute.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jean Charles de Borda | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Borda.html | first1=J.

Indeed, we know now that the resulting acceleration towards the ground is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator. It follows that the polar diameter of the Earth is smaller than its equatorial diameter. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] planned to infer the [[flattening]] of the Earth from both the length's differences between meridional portions corresponding to one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] and the variations of gravitational acceleration (see [[Clairaut's theorem]]). [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] published in 1821 their observations completing those of Delambre and Mechain. It was an account of the length's variation of the degrees of latitude along the Paris meridian as well as the account of the variation of the [[seconds pendulum]]'s length along the same meridian. The seconds pendulum's length was a mean to measure ''g'', the local acceleration resulting from combinaison of local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies with [[latitude]] (see [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]).<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/6/2075/ |title=Figure de la Terre |trans-title=Figure of the Earth |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/4/3824/ |title=Degr\u00e9 |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/12/1152/|title=Pendule |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3047v|title=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences / publi\u00e9s... par MM. les secr\u00e9taires perp\u00e9tuels|last=Faye|first=Herv\u00e9|date=1880|website=Gallica|pages=1463\u20131466|language=EN|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perrier|first=G\u00e9n\u00e9ral|date=1935|journal=Thal\u00e8s|volume=2|pages=117\u2013129|issn=0398-7817|jstor=43861533|title=Historique Sommaire de la Geodesie}}</ref><ref name=\"gallica\" /><ref name=\"Murdin\" /><ref group=\"Note\">At the time the second was defined as a fraction of the Earth's rotation time and determined by clocks whose precision was checked by astronomical observations.

[[Louis Puissant]] declared in 1836 in front of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that Delambre and M\u00e9chain had made an error in the measurement of the French meridian arc. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc.

[[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] was responsible for the nineteenth-century investigations of the shape of the Earth by means of the pendulum's determination of gravity and the use of [[Clairaut's theorem]]. The studies he conducted from 1825 to 1828 and his determination of the length of the pendulum beating the second in Berlin seven years later marked the beginning of a new era in geodesy.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIndeed, the reversible pendulum as it was used by geodesists at the end of the 19th century was largely due to the work of Bessel, because neither [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]], its inventor, nor [[Henry Kater]] who used it in 1818 did not bring him the improvements which would result from the precious indications of Bessel, and which converted him into one of the most admirable instruments which it was given to the scientists of the nineteenth century to use.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reversible pendulum built by the Repsold brothers was used in Switzerland in 1865 by [[Emile Plantamour|\u00c9mile Plantamour]] for the measurement of gravity in six stations of the Swiss geodetic network.

On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the device designed by the Repsold brothers on Bessel's indications, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolphe Hirsch found a way to highlight the movements of the pendulum suspension plane by an ingenious optical amplification process.

If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, it could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the rulers for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimeter would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]]s, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey']]<nowiki/>s direction instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.<ref name=Faye /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

In recognition of France's role in designing the metric system, the BIPM is based in {{lang|fr|S\u00e8vres}}, just outside Paris. However, as an international organisation, the BIPM is under the ultimate control of a diplomatic conference, the ''{{lang|fr|[[Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures]]}}'' (CGPM) rather than the French government.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref>Article 3, [[Metre Convention]].</ref>\n\nThe construction of the international prototype metre and the copies which would be national standards was at the limits of the technology of the time.

Advances in both experimental technique and theory showed that the cadmium line was actually a cluster of closely separated lines, and that this was due to the presence of different [[isotope]]s in natural cadmium (eight in total).

Increasingly accurate measurements were required, and scientists looked for measures that were universal and could be based on natural phenomena rather than royal decree or physical prototypes. Rather than the various complex systems of subdivision in use, they also preferred a decimal system to ease their calculations.\n\nWith the [[French Revolution]] (1789) came a desire to replace many features of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], including [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|the traditional units of measure]]. As a base unit of length, many scientists had favoured the [[seconds pendulum]] (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that it varied from place to place with local gravity and that it could complement [[History of geodesy|meridian arc measurements]] in determining the [[figure of the Earth]]. A new unit of length, the ''metre'' was introduced \u2013 defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator [[Paris meridian|passing through Paris]], assuming an Earth's [[flattening]] of 1/334.\n\nFor practical purposes however, the standard metre was made available in the form of a platinum bar held in Paris. This in turn was replaced in 1889 at the initiative of the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] by thirty platinum-iridium bars kept across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/international-metre-commission.html|title=BIPM - Commission internationale du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of a special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.<ref name=\"la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre\" /> Progress in science finally allowed to dematerialize the definition of the metre, so in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in krypton-86 allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement.

France was particularly affected by the proliferation of length measures, and the need for reform was widely accepted across all political viewpoints, even if it needed the push of revolution to bring it about. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] resurrected the idea of the seconds pendulum before the Constituent Assembly in 1790, suggesting that the new measure be defined at 45\u00b0N (a latitude that, in France, runs just north of Bordeaux and just south of Grenoble): despite the support of the Assembly, nothing came of Talleyrand's proposal.<ref name=\"Larousse\"/><ref group=\"Note\">The idea of the [[seconds pendulum]] as a length standard did not die completely, and such a standard was used to define the [[yard]] in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 1878.</ref>\n\n==Meridional definition==\n{{see also|Earth's circumference#Historical use in the definition of units of measurement|Meridian arc#History of measurement}}\n<!-- \"Meridional definition\" links here -->\n[[File:Dunkerque Belfort.JPG|thumb|upright|Belfry, Dunkirk \u2013 the northern end of the [[meridian arc]]]]\n[[File:Reflecting circle-CnAM 1842-IMG 4998-gradient.jpg|left|thumb|[[Repeating circle]]]]\n\nThe question of measurement reform was placed in the hands of the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences]], who appointed a commission chaired by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]]. Borda was an avid supporter of [[decimalisation]]: he had invented the \"[[repeating circle]]\", a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in \"''[[grad (angle)|grade]]s''\" ({{frac|100}} of a quarter-circle) rather than [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, with 100&nbsp;minutes to a ''grade'' and 100&nbsp;seconds to a minute.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jean Charles de Borda | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Borda.html | first1=J.

Indeed, we know now that the resulting acceleration towards the ground is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator. It follows that the polar diameter of the Earth is smaller than its equatorial diameter. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] planned to infer the [[flattening]] of the Earth from both the length's differences between meridional portions corresponding to one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] and the variations of gravitational acceleration (see [[Clairaut's theorem]]). [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] published in 1821 their observations completing those of Delambre and Mechain. It was an account of the length's variation of the degrees of latitude along the Paris meridian as well as the account of the variation of the [[seconds pendulum]]'s length along the same meridian. The seconds pendulum's length was a mean to measure ''g'', the local acceleration resulting from combinaison of local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies with [[latitude]] (see [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]).<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/6/2075/ |title=Figure de la Terre |trans-title=Figure of the Earth |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/4/3824/ |title=Degr\u00e9 |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/12/1152/|title=Pendule |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3047v|title=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences / publi\u00e9s... par MM. les secr\u00e9taires perp\u00e9tuels|last=Faye|first=Herv\u00e9|date=1880|website=Gallica|pages=1463\u20131466|language=EN|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perrier|first=G\u00e9n\u00e9ral|date=1935|journal=Thal\u00e8s|volume=2|pages=117\u2013129|issn=0398-7817|jstor=43861533|title=Historique Sommaire de la Geodesie}}</ref><ref name=\"gallica\" /><ref name=\"Murdin\" /><ref group=\"Note\">At the time the second was defined as a fraction of the Earth's rotation time and determined by clocks whose precision was checked by astronomical observations.

[[Louis Puissant]] declared in 1836 in front of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that Delambre and M\u00e9chain had made an error in the measurement of the French meridian arc. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected.

[[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] was responsible for the nineteenth-century investigations of the shape of the Earth by means of the pendulum's determination of gravity and the use of [[Clairaut's theorem]]. The studies he conducted from 1825 to 1828 and his determination of the length of the pendulum beating the second in Berlin seven years later marked the beginning of a new era in geodesy.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIndeed, the reversible pendulum as it was used by geodesists at the end of the 19th century was largely due to the work of Bessel, because neither [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]], its inventor, nor [[Henry Kater]] who used it in 1818 did not bring him the improvements which would result from the precious indications of Bessel, and which converted him into one of the most admirable instruments which it was given to the scientists of the nineteenth century to use.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reversible pendulum built by the Repsold brothers was used in Switzerland in 1865 by [[Emile Plantamour|\u00c9mile Plantamour]] for the measurement of gravity in six stations of the Swiss geodetic network.

On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the device designed by the Repsold brothers on Bessel's indications, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolphe Hirsch found a way to highlight the movements of the pendulum suspension plane by an ingenious optical amplification process.

Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the rulers for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimeter would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]]s, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey']]<nowiki/>s direction instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.<ref name=Faye /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

Advances in both experimental technique and theory showed that the cadmium line was actually a cluster of closely separated lines, and that this was due to the presence of different [[isotope]]s in natural cadmium (eight in total).

In 1977, they moved to New York City to get into the American market.  Morali had written a few dance tunes when he was given a demo tape recorded by singer/actor Victor Willis. After hiring Willis to sing background vocals on the four tracks, Morali approached him and said, \"I had a dream that you sang lead on my album and it went very, very big\". Willis agreed to sing on the eponymous debut album ''Village People''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Village People, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979</ref>\n\nSongwriters Phil Hurtt and Peter Whitehead wrote the lyrics for the first album (Willis would subsequently take over writing duties in 1978 for the group's biggest hits). The Village People studio band was called ''Gypsy Lane'', conducted by [[Horace Ott]], who also provided much of the musical arrangements for Morali, who did not play any instruments.<ref>Straight, No Chaser by Victor Willis, 1990</ref>\n\nThe album became an international hit, and demand for live appearances soon followed. Morali hastily built a group of dancers around Willis to perform in clubs and videos. Morali met the first recruit, [[Felipe Rose]] (who claims indigenous American descent and dressed as a Native American), in a  New York gay bar called the Anvil.  Willis hand-picked [[Alex Briley]] (who initially portrayed an athlete but eventually became the group's soldier/sailor). The others were Mark Mussler (construction worker), Dave Forrest (cowboy), Lee Mouton (leatherman/biker), and Peter Whitehead (one of the group's early songwriters), who appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and in the video for the group's first hit, \"San Francisco (You Got Me)\".\n\nWith record sales soaring, Morali and Willis saw the need to create a permanent group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=WIKANE |first1=CHRISTIAN JOHN |title=Under the Hard Hat: An Interview with Village People's David Hodo |url=https://www.popmatters.com/182364-under-the-hard-hat-an-interview-with-village-peoples-david-hodo-2495654587.html |website=popmatters.com}}</ref> They took out an ad in a theatre trade paper which read: ''\"''Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A Moustache.''\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]] (leatherman), [[David Hodo]] (construction worker) and [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] (cowboy) were among the hundreds who answered the ad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWith the \"official\" lineup in place, the group did a hasty photo-shoot for the cover of the already-recorded ''[[Macho Man (album)|Macho Man]]'' album.  The 1978 hit single \"[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]\" catapulted the group into the mainstream, and their follow-up single \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\" became one of the most popular hits of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, the [[United States Navy]] considered using their single \"In the Navy\" in a television and radio recruiting campaign. Belolo offered them permission if the Navy would help film a music video for it. The Navy provided them access to the San Diego Navy base, where the {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, several aircraft, and the crew of the ship would be used.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock8 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Everyday people |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> This song was also performed on the TV series ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and in the 1995 Navy comedy movie ''[[Down Periscope]]''.\n\nThe group's fame peaked in 1979 with a three-month North American tour, several appearances on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]],'' and performing with [[Bob Hope]] to entertain U.S. troops. They were also featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979. Willis left the group in August 1979, during production of the upcoming musical movie tentatively titled ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Discoland: Where the Music Never Ends]]''. He was replaced by [[Ray Simpson]], the brother of [[Valerie Simpson]] (of [[Ashford & Simpson]]) who had previously sung background vocals with the group on their 1979 tour.  The end of 1979 saw the release of ''[[Live and Sleazy]]'', a double album featuring Victor Willis on lead vocals on the \u201cLive\u201d disc and Simpson's debut with the group on the \"Sleazy\" disc.\n\n=== 1980\u20131985 ===\nIn June 1980 the feature film now retitled ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' was released. The film was directed by [[Nancy Walker]], written by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Bronte Woodard]], music and lyrics by Jacques Morali (except Willis who penned the lyrics to \"Milkshake\" and \"Magic Night\") and starring [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Valerie Perrine]], Jean-Claude Billmaer, and [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce (Caitlyn) Jenner]].  By the time it was released disco's popularity had waned.  At the [[1980 Golden Raspberry Awards|March 1981 Golden Raspberry Awards]], the movie was named [[Razzies|Worst Picture]] and [[Razzies|Worst Screenplay]], and was nominated in almost all the other categories. Although the title song became a club play chart success and moderate radio hit, it was nominated for Worst Original Song \"Razzie\" and did not live up to sales expectations, never obtaining gold status as a single or album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Razzie Awards (1981) |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1981/1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> The soundtrack also featured the talents of David London, who under his real name [[Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen]] became the future lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and one of the main contributors to Village People's next album. The group embarked on a tour in promotion of the film in Australia and Japan. The Japanese show was filmed at Budokan and released on DVD as Village People Live In Japan.\n\nThe group appeared in the November 22, 1980, episode of ''[[Love Boat]]'' (season four, episode seven). At the end of 1980, Jeff Olson joined the group as the cowboy.\n\nIn 1981, with [[new wave music]] becoming more popular than disco, Morali and Belolo ditched the familiar characters and re-branded Village People with a new look inspired by the [[New Romantic]] movement, and released the album ''[[Renaissance (Village People album)|Renaissance]]''. It only attracted minor \u2013 mostly negative \u2013 attention, but did produce the group's first hit single in Italy with \"5 O'clock in the Morning.\"\n\nWillis rejoined the group briefly in late 1981 for the writing and recording the album ''[[Fox on the Box]]'', which was released in 1982 in Europe and Japan, and in 1983 in the United States under the title ''In the Street''.  David Hodo and Ray Simpson both left the group in 1982 with Mark Lee and [[Miles Jaye]] replacing them respectively. Jaye contributed lead vocals to a single in 1983 called \"America\", which would be added as extra track to the 1999 remaster of ''In the Street''. \n\nTheir next album, the 1985 dance/[[Hi-NRG]] release ''[[Sex Over the Phone]]'', was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than ''Renaissance''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the [[BBC]] because of its subject matter: credit-card [[phone sex]].<ref>[[Juke Magazine]] February 13, 1985.</ref> Though banned, it did peak at 59 on the UK singles chart. The album featured yet another new lead singer, [[Ray Stephens (singer)|Ray Stephens]] (of ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]'' fame). It was the group's last album of new material until ''A Village People Christmas'' in 2018.  Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985 and can be seen in both promotional videos made for the group.\n\nIn 1985 the group took a hiatus, but returned in 1987 with the lineup of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley, and Ray Simpson and formed ''Sixuvus Ltd'' a group that managed the affairs of the group and had the license to use the name Village People and its characters in use until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/30/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: Glenn Hughes|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=March 30, 2001|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s\u2013present ===\n[[File:VPStarfront.jpg|thumb|Village People receive their star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2008.

On September 22, 1991 they performed in front of 41,815 in [[Sydney]], Australia, as part of the pre-game entertainment for the [[1991 Rugby League Grand Final|New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final]] held at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].   They also performed a medley of self-parody songs at the [[1993 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] \u2013 \"In the Movies\" (\"In the Navy\"), \"Psycho Bitch\" (\"Macho Man\"), and \"My MTV\" (\"Y.M.C.A.\"). The group also made a guest appearance on the hit show ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in the episode \"[[Take My Wife, Please (Married... with Children episode)|Take My Wife, Please]]\".\n\nFounder Jacques Morali died of complications related to [[AIDS]] in Paris, France on November 15, 1991.  Three years later, the Village People recorded with the German national football team on its official [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup '94]] song ''Far Away in America''. In 1995, Eric Anzalone replaced Glenn Hughes as the Leatherman/Biker, and made his music video debut with [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Rob Schneider]], and other cast members during the end-credits of the film ''[[Down Periscope]]'', performing \"In The Navy\" with Ray Simpson on lead vocals.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century Village People released two singles, \"Gunbalanya\" (2000) and \"Loveship 2001\" (2001) under the name \"Amazing Veepers\".  It was reported in 2001 that 'Gunbalanya', which was recorded with indigenous Australian people, took its title from a word meaning \"in the tribe\" though it is in fact the name of an Aboriginal settlement. Leatherman/Biker Glenn Hughes died of lung cancer in New York City on March 4, 2001.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/village-peoples-hughes-dead-20010313 Village People's Hughes Dead], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''; March 13, 2001</ref>  Village People performed as the opening act for [[Cher]] on her [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]] until it ended in April 2005.

In May 2012 Willis won a landmark ruling in the first case heard regarding the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing rights initially granted to record companies and publishers after 35 years.

In 1977, they moved to New York City to get into the American market.  Morali had written a few dance tunes when he was given a demo tape recorded by singer/actor Victor Willis. After hiring Willis to sing background vocals on the four tracks, Morali approached him and said, \"I had a dream that you sang lead on my album and it went very, very big\". Willis agreed to sing on the eponymous debut album ''Village People''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Village People, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979</ref>\n\nSongwriters Phil Hurtt and Peter Whitehead wrote the lyrics for the first album (Willis would subsequently take over writing duties in 1978 for the group's biggest hits). The Village People studio band was called ''Gypsy Lane'', conducted by [[Horace Ott]], who also provided much of the musical arrangements for Morali, who did not play any instruments.<ref>Straight, No Chaser by Victor Willis, 1990</ref>\n\nThe album became an international hit, and demand for live appearances soon followed. Morali hastily built a group of dancers around Willis to perform in clubs and videos. Morali met the first recruit, [[Felipe Rose]] (who claims indigenous American descent and dressed as a Native American), in a  New York gay bar called the Anvil.  Willis hand-picked [[Alex Briley]] (who initially portrayed an athlete but eventually became the group's soldier/sailor). The others were Mark Mussler (construction worker), Dave Forrest (cowboy), Lee Mouton (leatherman/biker), and Peter Whitehead (one of the group's early songwriters), who appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and in the video for the group's first hit, \"San Francisco (You Got Me)\".\n\nWith record sales soaring, Morali and Willis saw the need to create a permanent group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=WIKANE |first1=CHRISTIAN JOHN |title=Under the Hard Hat: An Interview with Village People's David Hodo |url=https://www.popmatters.com/182364-under-the-hard-hat-an-interview-with-village-peoples-david-hodo-2495654587.html |website=popmatters.com}}</ref> They took out an ad in a theatre trade paper which read: ''\"''Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A Moustache.''\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]] (leatherman), [[David Hodo]] (construction worker) and [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] (cowboy) were among the hundreds who answered the ad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWith the \"official\" lineup in place, the group did a hasty photo-shoot for the cover of the already-recorded ''[[Macho Man (album)|Macho Man]]'' album.  The 1978 hit single \"[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]\" catapulted the group into the mainstream, and their follow-up single \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\" became one of the most popular hits of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, the [[United States Navy]] considered using their single \"In the Navy\" in a television and radio recruiting campaign. Belolo offered them permission if the Navy would help film a music video for it. The Navy provided them access to the San Diego Navy base, where the {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, several aircraft, and the crew of the ship would be used.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock8 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Everyday people |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> This song was also performed on the TV series ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and in the 1995 Navy comedy movie ''[[Down Periscope]]''.\n\nThe group's fame peaked in 1979 with a three-month North American tour, several appearances on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]],'' and performing with [[Bob Hope]] to entertain U.S. troops. They were also featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979. Willis left the group in August 1979, during production of the upcoming musical movie tentatively titled ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Discoland: Where the Music Never Ends]]''. He was replaced by [[Ray Simpson]], the brother of [[Valerie Simpson]] (of [[Ashford & Simpson]]) who had previously sung background vocals with the group on their 1979 tour.  The end of 1979 saw the release of ''[[Live and Sleazy]]'', a double album featuring Victor Willis on lead vocals on the \u201cLive\u201d disc and Simpson's debut with the group on the \"Sleazy\" disc.\n\n=== 1980\u20131985 ===\nIn June 1980 the feature film now retitled ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' was released. The film was directed by [[Nancy Walker]], written by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Bronte Woodard]], music and lyrics by Jacques Morali (except Willis who penned the lyrics to \"Milkshake\" and \"Magic Night\") and starring [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Valerie Perrine]], Jean-Claude Billmaer, and [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce (Caitlyn) Jenner]].  By the time it was released disco's popularity had waned.  At the [[1980 Golden Raspberry Awards|March 1981 Golden Raspberry Awards]], the movie was named [[Razzies|Worst Picture]] and [[Razzies|Worst Screenplay]], and was nominated in almost all the other categories. Although the title song became a club play chart success and moderate radio hit, it was nominated for Worst Original Song \"Razzie\" and did not live up to sales expectations, never obtaining gold status as a single or album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Razzie Awards (1981) |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1981/1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> The soundtrack also featured the talents of David London, who under his real name [[Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen]] became the future lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and one of the main contributors to Village People's next album. The group embarked on a tour in promotion of the film in Australia and Japan. The Japanese show was filmed at Budokan and released on DVD as Village People Live In Japan.\n\nThe group appeared in the November 22, 1980, episode of ''[[Love Boat]]'' (season four, episode seven). At the end of 1980, Jeff Olson joined the group as the cowboy.\n\nIn 1981, with [[new wave music]] becoming more popular than disco, Morali and Belolo ditched the familiar characters and re-branded Village People with a new look inspired by the [[New Romantic]] movement, and released the album ''[[Renaissance (Village People album)|Renaissance]]''. It only attracted minor \u2013 mostly negative \u2013 attention, but did produce the group's first hit single in Italy with \"5 O'clock in the Morning.\"\n\nWillis rejoined the group briefly in late 1981 for the writing and recording the album ''[[Fox on the Box]]'', which was released in 1982 in Europe and Japan, and in 1983 in the United States under the title ''In the Street''.  David Hodo and Ray Simpson both left the group in 1982 with Mark Lee and [[Miles Jaye]] replacing them respectively. Jaye contributed lead vocals to a single in 1983 called \"America\", which would be added as extra track to the 1999 remaster of ''In the Street''. \n\nTheir next album, the 1985 dance/[[Hi-NRG]] release ''[[Sex Over the Phone]]'', was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than ''Renaissance''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the [[BBC]] because of its subject matter: credit-card [[phone sex]].<ref>[[Juke Magazine]] February 13, 1985.</ref> Though banned, it did peak at 59 on the UK singles chart. The album featured yet another new lead singer, [[Ray Stephens (singer)|Ray Stephens]] (of ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]'' fame). It was the group's last album of new material until ''A Village People Christmas'' in 2018.  Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985 and can be seen in both promotional videos made for the group.\n\nIn 1985 the group took a hiatus, but returned in 1987 with the lineup of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley, and Ray Simpson and formed ''Sixuvus Ltd'' a group that managed the affairs of the group and had the license to use the name Village People and its characters in use until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/30/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: Glenn Hughes|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=March 30, 2001|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s\u2013present ===\n[[File:VPStarfront.jpg|thumb|Village People receive their star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2008.

On September 22, 1991 they performed in front of 41,815 in [[Sydney]], Australia, as part of the pre-game entertainment for the [[1991 Rugby League Grand Final|New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final]] held at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].   They also performed a medley of self-parody songs at the [[1993 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] \u2013 \"In the Movies\" (\"In the Navy\"), \"Psycho Bitch\" (\"Macho Man\"), and \"My MTV\" (\"Y.M.C.A.\"). The group also made a guest appearance on the hit show ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in the episode \"[[Take My Wife, Please (Married... with Children episode)|Take My Wife, Please]]\".\n\nFounder Jacques Morali died of complications related to [[AIDS]] in Paris, France on November 15, 1991.  Three years later, the Village People recorded with the German national football team on its official [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup '94]] song ''Far Away in America''. In 1995, Eric Anzalone replaced Glenn Hughes as the Leatherman/Biker, and made his music video debut with [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Rob Schneider]], and other cast members during the end-credits of the film ''[[Down Periscope]]'', performing \"In The Navy\" with Ray Simpson on lead vocals.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century Village People released two singles, \"Gunbalanya\" (2000) and \"Loveship 2001\" (2001) under the name \"Amazing Veepers\".  It was reported in 2001 that 'Gunbalanya', which was recorded with indigenous Australian people, took its title from a word meaning \"in the tribe\" though it is in fact the name of an Aboriginal settlement. Leatherman/Biker Glenn Hughes died of lung cancer in New York City on March 4, 2001.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/village-peoples-hughes-dead-20010313 Village People's Hughes Dead], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''; March 13, 2001</ref>  Village People performed as the opening act for [[Cher]] on her [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]] until it ended in April 2005.

In May 2012 Willis won a landmark ruling in the first case heard regarding the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing rights initially granted to record companies and publishers after 35 years.

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045n jki lhj gfdxgbhnuytcrdtvbgvfdxcgbhvdcrfghbtfgyhjyug67hjyu67hujk]8ujuhyghujuyhgyhuhyhjbtfryhfr6gtyht6yhugt66yt65r6tfdxre5r6tgfcdfxr5tgfcxdrr5tgygfvdr5fgvf dr5f6gtfcf xdesd54r6tg cxd5f6tyvrfr54t6tre4dvbr ymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endcftrghyjunhgfvtrghyb fvtrghybgcf vthyhngvcfvgt6hygvc ftrghygfvtrt6hygfcfry6htfvtfrg6bfvtrg6rfcdtgytrdcxcfvgftdcrfvytdrxcfgyvftryfr5gygtfrtgytfrgyutgfrtyutrftggytfvrgyghhgytg7hyghvbyhuhgbyhub gbhyunhbhyunjbhyunb ghyunb gvbyhbgvyhujnhgty7hbgy67yhbgftvr6y7hfd35ow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.  The recording was directed and produced by [[Donald Lawrence]] and was released as a [[CD]] on April 10, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213174605/http://www.theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> on EMI Gospel, followed by a CD/DVD Special Edition release June 19, 2007.

Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen[[soprano|(soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* 1973: ''[[Jesus Has a Lot to Give]]''\n* 1974: ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters''\n* 1976: ''[[Unworthy (The Clark Sisters album)|Unworthy]]''\n* 1978: ''Count it All Joy''\n* 1978: ''[[New Dimensions of Christmas Carols]]''\n* 1979: ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose (But All to Gain)]]'' \n* 1980: ''[[Is My Living in Vain (The Clark Sisters album)|Is My Living In Vain]]'' \n* 1981: ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' \n* 1982: ''[[Sincerely (The Clark Sisters album)|Sincerely]]'' \n* 1986: ''[[Best (The Clark Sisters album)|Best]]''\n* 1986: ''Heart and Soul'' \n* 1988: ''Conqueror'' \n* 1989: ''Bringing It Back Home'' \n* 1994: ''Miracle'' \n* 2007: ''[[Live - One Last Time]]'' \n* 2009: ''A Clark Family Christmas'' \n* 2020: ''[[The Return (The Clark Sisters album)|The Return]]\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen[[soprano|(soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\".

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023.

cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023.
