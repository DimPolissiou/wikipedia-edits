It is also used by the association football club Football Agglom\u00e9ration Carcassonne for their big matches. Built in 1899, it is one of the oldest stadiums in France, and was renovated in 2002, and again in 2012 when US Carcassonne entered the Pro D2. The stadium is named after the French rugby union player [[Albert Domec]], who died 20 September 1948, and who represented [[France national rugby union team|France]] in 1939. The stadium is also equipped for athletics and has an eight lane 400m track.\n\nThe stadium has been used in [[Rugby League World Cup]]s. The ground has hosted many French rugby league championship and cup finals as well as French rugby league internationals, the first being in 1967 when [[Great Britain national rugby league team]] won 16\u201313 in front of 10,650 spectators\n\n== History ==\n\nFormerly called 'le stade de la Pepiniere' the ground was built and opened in 1899 and sits within the medieval castle walls of the city. In 1919 the rugby club paid 95,000 francs for the site then sold it to the local council a year later. The council built the two main stands that run along the length of the pitch each able to hold 3,000 spectators, floodlights and a cycle track were also installed. The stadium has been renovated twice since in 2002 and in 2012.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Delaney|first1=Trevor|title=The International Grounds of Rugby League|date=1995|publisher=Trevor R Delaney|isbn=978-0950998244|pages=154, 155}}</ref> The ground is named after the former [[US Carcassonne]] and French rugby union international player [[Albert Domec]] who played as a centre during the 1920s and 1930s.

It is also used by the association football club Football Agglom\u00e9ration Carcassonne for their big matches. Built in 1899, it is one of the oldest stadiums in France, and was renovated in 2002, and again in 2012 when US Carcassonne entered the Pro D2. The stadium is named after the French rugby union player [[Albert Domec]], who died 20 September 1948, and who represented [[France national rugby union team|France]] in 1939. The stadium is also equipped for athletics and has an eight lane 400m track.\n\nThe stadium has been used in [[Rugby League World Cup]]s. The ground has hosted many French rugby league championship and cup finals as well as French rugby league internationals, the first being in 1967 when [[Great Britain national rugby league team]] won 16\u201313 in front of 10,650 spectators\n\n== History ==\n\nFormerly called 'le stade de la Pepiniere' the ground was built and opened in 1899 and sits within the medieval castle walls of the city. In 1919 the rugby club paid 95,000 francs for the site then sold it to the local council a year later. The council built the two main stands that run along the length of the pitch each able to hold 3,000 spectators, floodlights and a cycle track were also installed. The stadium has been renovated twice since in 2002 and in 2012.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Delaney|first1=Trevor|title=The International Grounds of Rugby League|date=1995|publisher=Trevor R Delaney|isbn=978-0950998244|pages=154, 155}}</ref> The ground is named after the former [[US Carcassonne]] and French rugby union international player [[Albert Domec]] who played as a centre during the 1920s and 1930s. The stadium has a bronze statue of AS Carcassonne's most famous player, former captain of the [[France national rugby league team|French national rugby league team]], [[Puig Aubert]] at its entrance. The record attendance at the ground is 23,500 for the [[French rugby league championship]] final in 1949 between [[AS Carcassonne]] and [[Marseille XIII]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PUIG.jpg|thumb|Stautue of Puig Albert outside ground]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:STADEALBERT.jpg|thumb|Main Stand]] -->\n\n== International Rugby League Matches ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Morris Chestnut]], [[Michael Eklund]], [[Michael Imperioli]], and [[David Otunga]] also star. The story was originally envisioned as a television series, but D'Ovidio later rewrote it as a feature film. Filming began in July 2012 and spanned a period of 25 days, with all scenes being shot in [[California]], mainly [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]].\n\nA screening of ''The Call'' was held at the Women's International Film Festival hosted at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26, 2013. [[TriStar Pictures]] released it to theatres on March 15, 2013. Considered to be [[high-concept]] by many reviewers, the film proved a commercial success, grossing over $68 million against budget of $13 million. Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and Best Actress at the [[BET Awards]] while the film itself received mixed reviews from critics, but praised Berry and Breslin's performances and the film's suspense.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Los Angeles Police Department]] veteran [[9-1-1]] operator, Jordan Turner, receives a call one night, from a teenage girl, Leah Templeton, fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home. Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs. When the call is disconnected, Jordan calls Leah back, a decision that costs Leah her life. The ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds \"It's already done\" and hangs up, leaving her distraught.\n\nThe next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected by the incident, Jordan tells her boyfriend, Officer Paul Phillips, that she can no longer handle field calls.\n\nSix months later, she is working as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Teenager Casey Welson is kidnapped from a mall parking garage by a man named Michael Foster after shopping with her friend, Autumn, and forced into the trunk of his car, a red [[Toyota Camry (XV30)|Toyota Camry LE]]. Casey had taken Autumn's [[TracFone|disposable phone]] after she accidentally left it in the mall, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator, Brooke, receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over. However, Casey's use of a disposable Phase I phone means that her location cannot be determined by GPS, showing only the location of the Cell Tower the disposable is connected to.\n\nWhile Michael drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a [[tail light]] and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1 on a phone with Phase II capabilities, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole. This attracts the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado, but Michael knocks him out with a shovel, and assuming him to be dead stuffs Alan in the trunk of a black [[Lincoln Town Car|Lincoln Town Car Signature Limited]] with Casey.\n\nAlan reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, and Michael stabs him, unfortunately Alan gives away an Escape Lever to Michael who rips it out. Michael stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream for help. A gas attendant attempts to bust the door open, but Michael sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him, burning him.\n\nUpon arriving at his destination, Michael removes Casey from the trunk and finds the phone in her pocket, with 9-1-1 listening on the line. Through the phone, Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to surrender himself and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, \"It's already done\", leading Jordan to realize that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah six months prior.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul, accompanied by Officer Jake Devans and others in law enforcement, raid Michael's home, but find only his wife and children. Finding a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, they realize that Casey resembles her. Additionally, the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael's wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody there and leave.\n\nMichael begins to wash and cut Casey's hair. Determined to rescue Casey, Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his [[leukemia]]-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor [[flagpole]]\u2014exactly the same sound she heard in the background in the final moments of the 9-1-1 call. She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood. Jordan accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar and climbs down in without calling the police.\n\nNavigating the cellar, Jordan hides from an emerging Michael. The cellar itself pieces together Michael's backstory. Michael had [[incest]]uous feelings towards Melinda and was distraught when she fell ill, lost all of her hair and died of leukemia. Michael has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister. He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sister's hair.\n\nJordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a foldable wheelchair and attacks Michael, as he begins to lacerate Casey's scalp. She frees Casey and both make an attempt to escape the cellar, during which Casey stabs Michael in the back with a pair of scissors. Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While he is knocked out, they tie him to the same chair Casey was restrained to during captivity.\n\nWhen he regains consciousness, they inform him that they plan to [[starvation|leave him to die]] and claim that Casey had escaped, that she was found by Jordan in the woods, and that Michael disappeared. Michael pleads that they cannot just leave him there, but Jordan replies using Michael's own words, \"It's already done.\" Michael shouts insults at them, Jordan locks the door and leaves, avenging Leah's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{divcol}}\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Jordan Turner, a 9-1-1 operator\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Casey Welson, a kidnapped teenager\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Officer Paul Phillips, Jordan's boyfriend\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Michael Foster, Casey's kidnapper\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Alan Denado, Michael's victim\n* [[David Otunga]] as Officer Jake Devan\n* [[Justina Machado]] as Rachel\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Marco\n* [[Roma Maffia]] as Maddy\n* Evie Thompson as Leah Templeton\n* Denise Dowse as Flora\n* [[Ella Rae Peck]] as Autumn\n* [[Jenna Lamia]] as Brooke\n* Ross Gallo as Josh\n* Shawnee Badger as Melinda Foster\n* [[Tara Platt]] as Female Trainee\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n{{quote box\n|width = 30em\n|border = 1px\n|align=right\n|bgcolor=#c6dbf7\n|fontsize = 85%\n|title_bg =\n|title_fnt =\n|title =\n|quote = \"I thought, 'That's a world we've never seen before in a film.'

He began to research the subject and visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center (MCDC). Finding the center, which has backup generators, bulletproof windows, and a moat surrounding the building, to be \"pretty amazing,\" he decided to shed light on what he viewed as a previously overlooked occupation. The story was originally conceptualized as a television series titled ''The Hive'' (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that \"the operators couldn't be the ones kicking in doors and going out into the field\" all the time. As a result, what was planned to be the pilot episode was expanded and revised as a movie.<ref name=\"Decker\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/62781/call-set-visit-report-part-one-writer-richard-dovidio-his-inspiration-research-and-more |author= Decker, Sean |date= January 14, 2013 |title= The Call Set Visit Report - Part One: Writer Richard D'Ovidio on His Inspiration, Research, and More! |publisher= Dread Central |accessdate= March 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dwight-brown/the-call_b_2875451.html?ir=Entertainment |author= Brown, Dwight |date= March 15, 2013 |title= The Call |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |quote= Jordan (Berry) works in the L.A. 911 call center.

D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, \"I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" /> Berry remarked, \"I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women.

As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: \"Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nChestnut, who plays Phillips, a police officer and Turner's boyfriend, prepared by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe what it is like to be an officer in a squad car<ref name=\"Grant\" /> and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work.<ref name=\"Decker\" /> She told a ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' interviewer, \"You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing.

With a low budget of $13 million, they settled on [[Ottawa, Ontario]], where director Anderson had just finished another project. However, the [[California Film Commission]] (CFC) called back nine months later and informed them that the waiting list had been largely cleared and that they now qualified for $1.9 million in tax deduction. According to Producer Michael Helfant, they were \"literally days from starting to put down a deposit.\" Berry was reportedly pleased with the news, having wanted to stay in Los Angeles and the CFC helped secure film locations for the project.<ref name=\"Verrier\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Verrier|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/20/business/la-fi-ct-onlocation-20130320|title=A Fateful Call Keeps Filming of 'The Call' in L.A.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith a crew of roughly 120 persons, filming took a total of 25 days, spanning from July to August 2012. Car chase scenes were shot at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and a [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center. The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked in the trunk of a car. Other filming locations include the [[Burbank Town Center]] on Magnolia Boulevard in [[Burbank, California]], [[Santa Clarita, California]] and the 170 Highway.<ref name=\"Verrier\" /> At one point, Berry was rushed to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence. A spokesperson for Berry confirmed that she suffered a minor head injury and was taken to the hospital as a precaution, but she checked out healthy and was released.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2175149/Halle-Berry-rushed-hospital-accident-movie-set.html |title=Pictured: Halle Berry rushed to hospital 'after accident on movie set' |first=Sarah |last=Bull |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=July 18, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBerry told interviewer Kimberly Grant, \"The hard part for me was to try to stay connected to Phillips and Welson.\" This was because, Grant writes, \"she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor.\" Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut,<ref name=\"Zwecker\" /> Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: \"That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level [as Jordan], so that I would be on the same level as they [i.e., Casey and Officer Phillips] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character.\"<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe score of the film is composed by John Debney.

The film stars [[Abigail Breslin]] as Casey Welson, a teenage girl kidnapped by a [[serial killer]] and [[Halle Berry]] as Jordan Turner, a [[9-1-1]] operator, still suffering emotionally from a prior botched 9-1-1 call, who receives Casey's call. [[Morris Chestnut]], [[Michael Eklund]], [[Michael Imperioli]], and [[David Otunga]] also star. The story was originally envisioned as a television series, but D'Ovidio later rewrote it as a feature film. Filming began in July 2012 and spanned a period of 25 days, with all scenes being shot in [[California]], mainly [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]].\n\nA screening of ''The Call'' was held at the Women's International Film Festival hosted at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26, 2013. [[TriStar Pictures]] released it to theatres on March 15, 2013. Considered to be [[high-concept]] by many reviewers, the film proved a commercial success, grossing over $68 million against budget of $13 million. Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and Best Actress at the [[BET Awards]] while the film itself received mixed reviews from critics, but praised Berry and Breslin's performances and the film's suspense.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Los Angeles Police Department]] veteran [[9-1-1]] operator, Jordan Turner, receives a call one night, from a teenage girl, Leah Templeton, fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home. Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs. When the call is disconnected, Jordan calls Leah back, a decision that costs Leah her life. The ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds \"It's already done\" and hangs up, leaving her distraught.\n\nThe next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected by the incident, Jordan tells her boyfriend, Officer Paul Phillips, that she can no longer handle field calls.\n\nSix months later, she is working as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Teenager Casey Welson is kidnapped from a mall parking garage by a man named Michael Foster after shopping with her friend, Autumn, and forced into the trunk of his car. Casey had taken Autumn's [[TracFone|disposable phone]] after she accidentally left it in the mall, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator, Brooke, receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over. However, Casey's use of a disposable Phase I phone means that her location cannot be determined by GPS, showing only the location of the Cell Tower the disposable is connected to.\n\nWhile Michael drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a [[tail light]] and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1 on a phone with Phase II capabilities, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole. This attracts the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado, but Michael knocks him out with a shovel, and assuming him to be dead stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey.\n\nAlan reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, and Michael stabs him, unfortunately Alan gives away an Escape Lever to Michael who rips it out. Michael stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream for help. A gas attendant attempts to bust the door open, but Michael sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.\n\nUpon arriving at his destination, Michael removes Casey from the trunk and finds the phone in her pocket, with 9-1-1 listening on the line. Through the phone, Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to turn himself in and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, \"It's already done\", leading Jordan to realize that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah six months prior.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul, accompanied by Officer Jake Devans and others in law enforcement, raid Michael's home, but find only his wife and children. Finding a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, they realize that Casey resembles her. Additionally, the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael's wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody there and leave.\n\nMichael begins to wash and cut Casey's hair. Determined to rescue Casey, Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his [[leukemia]]-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor [[flagpole]]\u2014exactly the same sound she heard in the background in the final moments of the 9-1-1 call. She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood. Jordan accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar and climbs down in without calling the police.\n\nNavigating the cellar, Jordan hides from an emerging Michael. The cellar itself pieces together Michael's backstory. Michael had [[incest]]uous feelings towards his sister and was distraught when she fell ill, lost all of her hair and died of leukemia. Michael has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister. He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sister's hair.\n\nJordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a dentist chair and attacks Michael, as he begins to lacerate Casey's scalp. She frees Casey and both make an attempt to escape the cellar, during which Casey stabs Michael in the back with a pair of scissors. Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While he is knocked out, they tie him to a chair.\n\nWhen he regains consciousness, they inform him that they plan to [[starvation|leave him to die]] and claim that Casey had escaped, that she was found by Jordan in the woods, and that Michael disappeared. Michael pleads that they cannot just leave him there, but Jordan replies using Michael's own words, \"It's already done.\" Michael shouts insults at them, Jordan locks the door and leaves, avenging Leah's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{divcol}}\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Jordan Turner, a 9-1-1 operator\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Casey Welson, a kidnapped teenager\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Officer Paul Phillips, Jordan's boyfriend\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Michael Lewis Foster, Casey's kidnapper\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Alan Denado, Michael's victim\n* [[David Otunga]] as Officer Jake Devan\n* [[Justina Machado]] as Rachel\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Marco\n* [[Roma Maffia]] as Maddy\n* Evie Thompson as Leah Templeton\n* Denise Dowse as Flora\n* [[Ella Rae Peck]] as Autumn\n* [[Jenna Lamia]] as Brooke\n* Ross Gallo as Josh\n* Shawnee Badger as Melinda Foster\n* [[Tara Platt]] as Female Trainee\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n{{quote box\n|width = 30em\n|border = 1px\n|align=right\n|bgcolor=#c6dbf7\n|fontsize = 85%\n|title_bg =\n|title_fnt =\n|title =\n|quote = \"I thought, 'That's a world we've never seen before in a film.'

He began to research the subject and visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center (MCDC). Finding the center, which has backup generators, bulletproof windows, and a moat surrounding the building, to be \"pretty amazing,\" he decided to shed light on what he viewed as a previously overlooked occupation. The story was originally conceptualized as a television series titled ''The Hive'' (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that \"the operators couldn't be the ones kicking in doors and going out into the field\" all the time. As a result, what was planned to be the pilot episode was expanded and revised as a movie.<ref name=\"Decker\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/62781/call-set-visit-report-part-one-writer-richard-dovidio-his-inspiration-research-and-more |author= Decker, Sean |date= January 14, 2013 |title= The Call Set Visit Report - Part One: Writer Richard D'Ovidio on His Inspiration, Research, and More! |publisher= Dread Central |accessdate= March 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dwight-brown/the-call_b_2875451.html?ir=Entertainment |author= Brown, Dwight |date= March 15, 2013 |title= The Call |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |quote= Jordan (Berry) works in the L.A. 911 call center.

D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, \"I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" /> Berry remarked, \"I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women.

As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: \"Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nChestnut, who plays Phillips, a police officer and Turner's boyfriend, prepared by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe what it is like to be an officer in a squad car<ref name=\"Grant\" /> and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work.<ref name=\"Decker\" /> She told a ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' interviewer, \"You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere!

With a low budget of $13 million, they settled on [[Ottawa, Ontario]], where director Anderson had just finished another project. However, the [[California Film Commission]] (CFC) called back nine months later and informed them that the waiting list had been largely cleared and that they now qualified for $1.9 million in tax deduction. According to Producer Michael Helfant, they were \"literally days from starting to put down a deposit.\" Berry was reportedly pleased with the news, having wanted to stay in Los Angeles and the CFC helped secure film locations for the project.<ref name=\"Verrier\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Verrier|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/20/business/la-fi-ct-onlocation-20130320|title=A Fateful Call Keeps Filming of 'The Call' in L.A.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith a crew of roughly 120 persons, filming took a total of 25 days, spanning from July to August 2012. Car chase scenes were shot at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and a [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center. The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked in the trunk of a car. Other filming locations include the [[Burbank Town Center]] on Magnolia Boulevard in [[Burbank, California]], [[Santa Clarita, California]] and the 170 Highway.<ref name=\"Verrier\" /> At one point, Berry was rushed to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence.

In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor.\" Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut,<ref name=\"Zwecker\" /> Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: \"That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level [as Jordan], so that I would be on the same level as they [i.e., Casey and Officer Phillips] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character.\"<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe score of the film is composed by John Debney.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in [[Bruce Township, Chippewa County, Michigan|Bruce Township]]. Along with [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US Highway 2]] (US&nbsp;2), M-28 forms a pair of primary highways linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end, providing a major access route for traffic from Michigan and Canada along the southern shore of [[Lake Superior]]. M-28 is the longest state trunkline in Michigan numbered with the \"M-\" prefix at {{convert|290.373|mi|km|3}}. The entire highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], while three sections of M-28 are part of the [[Lake Superior Circle Tour]]. M-28 also carries two memorial highway designations along its route.\n\nThroughout its course across the Upper Peninsula, M-28 passes through forested woodlands, bog swamps, urbanized areas, and along the Lake Superior shoreline. Sections of roadway cross the [[Ottawa National Forest]] and both units of the [[Hiawatha National Forest]]. Some of the other landmarks accessible from M-28 include the Seney Stretch, [[Seney National Wildlife Refuge]] and several historic bridges.\n\nM-28 is an original trunkline designation, dating to the 1919 formation of the state's trunkline system. The original highway was much shorter than the current version. M-28 was expanded eastward to the Sault Ste. Marie area in the late 1920s. The western end has been expanded twice to different locations on the [[Wisconsin]] state line. Other changes along the routing have led to the creation of three different [[business loop]]s at various times, with one still extant. Future changes, proposed by Marquette County but not accepted by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT), could see M-28 rerouted over County Road&nbsp;480 (CR&nbsp;480).\n\n== Route description ==\n[[File:M-28 Trout Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Clouds brewing over M-28 in western Ontonagon County|alt=a highway curving over the crest of a hill flanked by telephone poles on either side.

Several routing options have been discussed, though all would make CR&nbsp;480 a part of M-28.<ref name=\"mj\">{{cite news |first = Pete |last = Mackin |title = CR&nbsp;480 Plan Taking Shape |location = Marquette, Michigan |work = The Mining Journal |date = August 24, 2005 |pages = A1+ |issn = 0898-4964 |oclc = 9729223 }}</ref> Cost was the primary reason given behind rerouting M-28 along CR&nbsp;480. \"The road commission receives about $50,000{{#tag:ref|Equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|50000|2005|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}.{{inflation-fn|US-GDP|lastauthoramp=yes}}|group=lower-alpha}} a year in state gas tax money but spends about $100,000{{#tag:ref|Equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|100000|2005|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}.{{inflation-fn|US-GDP|lastauthoramp=yes}}|group=lower-alpha}} to maintain CR&nbsp;480 because of the type and volume of traffic it receives.\"<ref name=\"mj\"/> Handing CR&nbsp;480 over to the state would shift the maintenance costs to the state, as well.<ref name=\"mj\"/>\n\nMDOT has indicated that it has not requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a \"spur\" from US&nbsp;41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR&nbsp;480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining \"caving grounds\", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex.<ref name=\"mj\"/> According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, \"the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [spur] would push through.\"<ref name=\"mj\"/>\n\nThe spur proposal would open land to development between the downtown areas of the two cities. If jurisdiction is transferred, and M-28 is routed over CR&nbsp;480 as proposed, M-28 would leave the concurrency with US&nbsp;41 near [[Teal Lake (Michigan)|Teal Lake]] in Negaunee, and cross the caving grounds west of downtown to connect to Rail Street. Rail Street would serve as the connector to CR&nbsp;480, which ends at the intersection of Rail and Ann streets and Healey Avenue. Proposals indicate two routing options for the east end of CR&nbsp;480. One would route M-28 back along US&nbsp;41 from Beaver Grove north of the CR&nbsp;480 eastern terminus to the existing M-28 in Harvey. A second would route it along CR&nbsp;551/Cherry Creek Road from CR&nbsp;480 to M-28 in Harvey.<ref name=\"mj\"/>\n\n== Business loops ==\n{{Main article|U.S. Route 41 Business (Marquette, Michigan)| M-28 Business (Ishpeming\u2013Negaunee, Michigan)| M-28 Business (Newberry, Michigan) |l1=Business US&nbsp;41 in Marquette|l2=Business M-28 in Ishpeming\u2013Negaunee|l3=Business M-28 in Newberry}}\nThere have been three [[business loop]]s for M-28: Ishpeming\u2013Negaunee, Marquette and Newberry.

Along with [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US Highway 2]] (US&nbsp;2), M-28 forms a pair of primary highways linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end, providing a major access route for traffic from Michigan and Canada along the southern shore of [[Lake Superior]]. M-28 is the longest state trunkline in Michigan numbered with the \"M-\" prefix at {{convert|290.373|mi|km|3}}. The entire highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], while three sections of M-28 are part of the [[Lake Superior Circle Tour]]. M-28 also carries two memorial highway designations along its route.\n\nThroughout its course across the Upper Peninsula, M-28 passes through forested woodlands, bog swamps, urbanized areas, and along the Lake Superior shoreline. Sections of roadway cross the [[Ottawa National Forest]] and both units of the [[Hiawatha National Forest]]. Some of the other landmarks accessible from M-28 include the Seney Stretch, [[Seney National Wildlife Refuge]] and several historic bridges.\n\nM-28 is an original trunkline designation, dating to the 1919 formation of the state's trunkline system. The original highway was much shorter than the current version. M-28 was expanded eastward to the Sault Ste. Marie area in the late 1920s. The western end has been expanded twice to different locations on the [[Wisconsin]] state line. Other changes along the routing have led to the creation of three different [[business loop]]s at various times, with one still extant. Future changes, proposed by Marquette County but not accepted by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT), could see M-28 rerouted over County Road&nbsp;480 (CR&nbsp;480).\n\n== Route description ==\n[[File:M-28 Trout Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Clouds brewing over M-28 in western Ontonagon County|alt=a highway curving over the crest of a hill flanked by telephone poles on either side.

Several proposals have arisen, including creating a \"spur\" from US&nbsp;41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR&nbsp;480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining \"caving grounds\", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex.<ref name=\"mj\"/> According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, \"the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [spur] would push through.\"<ref name=\"mj\"/>\n\nThe spur proposal would open land to development between the downtown areas of the two cities. If jurisdiction is transferred, and M-28 is routed over CR&nbsp;480 as proposed, M-28 would leave the concurrency with US&nbsp;41 near [[Teal Lake (Michigan)|Teal Lake]] in Negaunee, and cross the caving grounds west of downtown to connect to Rail Street. Rail Street would serve as the connector to CR&nbsp;480, which ends at the intersection of Rail and Ann streets and Healey Avenue. Proposals indicate two routing options for the east end of CR&nbsp;480. One would route M-28 back along US&nbsp;41 from Beaver Grove north of the CR&nbsp;480 eastern terminus to the existing M-28 in Harvey.
