Frank Baum]]. The road also appears in the several sequel Oz books such as ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904) and ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'' (1913).\n\nThe road's most notable portrayal is in the classic 1939 MGM musical movie ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', loosely based on Baum's first Oz book. In the novel's first edition the road is mostly referred to as the '''''\"Road of Yellow Bricks'''''\". In the original story and in later films based on it such as ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), [[Dorothy Gale]] must find the road before embarking on her journey, as the [[tornado]] did not deposit her farmhouse directly in front of it as in the 1939 film.\n\n==Road's history==\nThe following is an excerpt from the third chapter of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', in which Dorothy sets off to see the Wizard:\n\n...\"''There were several roads near by, but it did not take Dorothy long to find the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the [[Emerald City]]; her [[Silver Shoes]] tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed ''\".\n\nThe road is first introduced in the third chapter of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. The road begins in the heart of the eastern quadrant called [[Munchkin Country]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. It functions as a guideline that leads all who follow it, to the road's ultimate destination\u2014the imperial capital of Oz called [[Emerald City]] that is located in the exact center of the entire continent. In the book, the novel's main protagonist, Dorothy, is forced to search for the road before she can begin her quest to seek the [[Oscar Diggs|Wizard]]. This is because the cyclone from [[Kansas]] did not release her farmhouse closely near it as it did in the various film adaptations. After the council with the native [[Munchkins]] and their dear friend the [[Good Witch of the North]], Dorothy begins looking for it and sees many pathways and roads nearby, (all of which lead in various directions). Thankfully it doesn't take her too long to spot the one paved with bright yellow bricks.\n\nLater in the book, Dorothy and her companions, the [[Scarecrow (Oz) |Scarecrow]], [[Tin Woodman]] and [[Cowardly Lion]] discover that the road has fallen into disrepair in some parts of the land, having several broken chasms ending at dangerous cliffs with deadly drops. In the end of the book we learn the road's history; unlike in [[Walt Disney|Walt Disney's]] prequel film ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'' (2013), the Emerald City and yellow brick road did not exist prior to Oz's arrival. When [[Oscar Diggs]] arrived in Oz via hot air-balloon that had been swept away in a storm, the people of the land were convinced he was a great \"Wizard\" who had finally come to fulfill Oz's long-awaited prophecy. Since the recent fall of Oz's mortal King [[Pastoria]], and the mysterious disappearance of his baby daughter [[Princess Ozma]], Oscar immediately proclaimed himself as Oz's new dominant ruler and had his people build the road as well as the city in his honor.\n\nIn the second Oz book, ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'', [[Princess Ozma|Tip]] and his companion [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], likewise follow a yellow brick road to reach Emerald City while traveling from Oz's northern quadrant, the [[Gillikin Country]].<ref name=\"Book\">[[L.

This version of the road does not exist in Baum's books. Also, at the cornfield where Dorothy meets and befriends the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], there is a [[intersection (road)|fork]] in the yellow brick road leading in different directions. Luckily they choose the correct one of the three branches that leads to Emerald City.\n\nIn Disney's 1985 live action semi-sequel to the 1939 movie ''[[Return to Oz]]'', Dorothy returns to Oz six months after being sent back home to [[Kansas]] from her first visit. Upon her second arrival she finds the yellow brick road in ruins by the hands of the evil [[Nome King]] who also conquered the Emerald City. In the end, it is presumed that after she defeats him and saves the city and its citizens, the road is restored as well.\n\n==Real yellow brick roads==\nThe actual road is believed to be one in [[Peekskill, New York]], where [[L.

Signal fires lay in readiness on tops of the surrounding mountains. The Fishkill encampment became the [[Fishkill Supply Depot|main supply depot]] for the northern department of the [[Continental Army]].

In 1931, [[Texaco]] purchased the old woolen mill site and established a research center there.

It opened on Sep. 17, 1975 at the [[off-Broadway]] Actor's Playhouse in [[New York City]]. It was produced by\nChristopher Larkin and [[Edith O'Hara]] in association with [[Lee Barton]].\nThe cast included Joe Barrett as Casey, David Gallegly as Guy and Raymond Wood as Clarence Cutler.\n\nThe show is a fast-paced, light-hearted musical-comedy, featuring a 1930s style Astaire/Rogers romance between two men, and a [[same-sex marriage]]. The world of the play posits that in 1936, [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex relationships]] are considered as normal as [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] ones. The play begins against the background of the abdication of [[Edward VIII]] and ends with the Duke of Windsor's (and the protagonists') June 1937 weddings. This is appropriate, as one of the major themes is \"Giving it Up for Love\". The action occurs in the [[Savoy Hotel]], a few elegant nightspots in [[London]], a bar in [[Spain]], and a [[Black sheep|black-sheep]] aunt's disreputable establishment in [[Paris]].\n\nThe show had its London premiere in December 2012. The cast included [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] winner [[Stephen Ashfield]] as Casey O'Brien with Johnjo Flynn as Guy Rose and Ben Kavanagh as Clarence Cutler.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe original production at the Actor's Playhouse in New York received admiring reviews - save for a criticism in the New York Times by Mel Gussow (about the acceptance of gay marriage in the 30s, he wrote, \"So much for thirties realism.\"). \u201cThe brightest, tunefullest, wittiest, most elegant, refined, gracious and entertaining musical in years!\" wrote Carll Tucker in [[The Village Voice]]. In [[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]], [[Alan Rich]] wrote that the play had \u201can uncommonly light and antic touch. The first of its kind that could happily play in an old ladies\u2019 home in Dubuque...delightful\u201d; while [[Robert Patrick (playwright)|Robert Patrick]] said that \"it rewrites the past and presents it just as entertainment, not in the Orwellian sense of trying to convince anyone the past was like that but saying that it ought to have been\u201d.  The production ran for two years. Subsequent productions in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] received positive reactions. It has often been revived regionally. \n\nThe 2012 production at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]] in London was well received by the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9719561/Boy-Meets-Boy-Jermyn-Street-Theatre-review.html|title=Boy Meets Boy, Jermyn Street Theatre, review|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=2012-12-03|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> [[Libby Purves]] in the [[The Times|Times]] called it \u201cFunny, silly and, with gay marriage on the horizon, slyly topical.\" Emma Slater wrote that it was \"an unexpected gem of a musical.

It opened on Sep. 17, 1975 at the [[off-Broadway]] Actor's Playhouse in [[New York City]]. It was produced by\nChristopher Larkin and [[Edith O'Hara]] in association with [[Lee Barton]].\n\nThe show is a fast-paced, light-hearted musical-comedy, featuring a 1930s style Astaire/Rogers romance between two men, and a [[same-sex marriage]]. The world of the play posits that in 1936, [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex relationships]] are considered as normal as [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] ones. The play begins against the background of the abdication of [[Edward VIII]] and ends with the Duke of Windsor's (and the protagonists') June 1937 weddings. This is appropriate, as one of the major themes is \"Giving it Up for Love\". The action occurs in the [[Savoy Hotel]], a few elegant nightspots in [[London]], a bar in [[Spain]], and a [[Black sheep|black-sheep]] aunt's disreputable establishment in [[Paris]].\n\nThe show had its London premiere in December 2012. The cast included [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] winner [[Stephen Ashfield]] as Casey O'Brien with Johnjo Flynn as Guy Rose and Ben Kavanagh as Clarence Cutler.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe original production at the Actor's Playhouse in New York received admiring reviews - save for a criticism in the New York Times by Mel Gussow (about the acceptance of gay marriage in the 30s, he wrote, \"So much for thirties realism.\"). \u201cThe brightest, tunefullest, wittiest, most elegant, refined, gracious and entertaining musical in years!\" wrote Carll Tucker in [[The Village Voice]]. In [[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]], [[Alan Rich]] wrote that the play had \u201can uncommonly light and antic touch. The first of its kind that could happily play in an old ladies\u2019 home in Dubuque...delightful\u201d; while [[Robert Patrick (playwright)|Robert Patrick]] said that \"it rewrites the past and presents it just as entertainment, not in the Orwellian sense of trying to convince anyone the past was like that but saying that it ought to have been\u201d.  The production ran for two years. Subsequent productions in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] received positive reactions. It has often been revived regionally. \n\nThe 2012 production at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]] in London was well received by the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9719561/Boy-Meets-Boy-Jermyn-Street-Theatre-review.html|title=Boy Meets Boy, Jermyn Street Theatre, review|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=2012-12-03|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> [[Libby Purves]] in the [[The Times|Times]] called it \u201cFunny, silly and, with gay marriage on the horizon, slyly topical.\" Emma Slater wrote that it was \"an unexpected gem of a musical. The score is varied in style and form, the lyrics clever, and the script highly intelligent and very funny. Both the script and lyrics have elements of Wilde\u2019s wit and Coward\u2019s charm.

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Anglia/Lincolnshire===\n* {{rws|Needham Market}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1971 and {{rws|Watlington}} closed in 1968 and reopened in 1975\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]].

Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] served by direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened (or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station.

The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===North Wales===\n* {{rws|Glan Conwy}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1970 and {{rws| Dolgarrog}} closed in 1964 but reopened the following year.\n* On the [[North Wales Coast Line]] the following stations closed in 1966 have been reopened [[Shotton railway station|Shotton Low Level]], {{rws|Conwy}}, {{rws|Llanfairpwll}} and {{rws|Valley}}\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n* {{rws|Penally}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1972 also {{rws|Fishguard and Goodwick}} closed for regular passenger services in 1964 reopened in 2012\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened.

cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Anglia/Lincolnshire===\n* {{rws|Needham Market}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1971 and {{rws|Watlington}} closed in 1968 and reopened in 1975\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened (or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n* Other stations reopened are {{rws|Dronfield}} (closed 1967 reopened 1981), {{rws|Slaithwaite}} (closed 1968 reopened 1982) and {{rws|Sherburn-in-Elmet}} (closed 1965 reopened 1984).\n\n===North West===\n* The Merseyrail line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross was closed in 1972 and mainly reopened in 1978.\n* {{rws|Wetheral}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1981.\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===North Wales===\n* {{rws|Glan Conwy}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1970 and {{rws| Dolgarrog}} closed in 1964 but reopened the following year.\n* On the [[North Wales Coast Line]] the following stations closed in 1966 have been reopened [[Shotton railway station|Shotton Low Level]], {{rws|Conwy}}, {{rws|Llanfairpwll}} and {{rws|Valley}}\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n* {{rws|Penally}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1972 also {{rws|Fishguard and Goodwick}} closed for regular passenger services in 1964 reopened in 2012\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened.

The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* [[East West Rail]] restoring passenger services between Bicester/ Aylesbury Vale Parkway to Milton Keynes. Future plans are to build a new railway between Bedford and Cambridge using part of the original alignment closed in 1968.\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023.

This software can be used to create or edit [[vector graphics]] such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos, icons and complex paintings. Inkscape's primary vector graphics format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG); however, many other formats can be imported and exported.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://inkscape.org/about/features/|title = Inkscape Features |accessdate = 13 January 2020|website = Inkscape.org }}</ref>\n\nInkscape can [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[color gradient]]s and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional [[image tracing|tracing]] of [[raster graphics]] is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\n\n==History==\nInkscape began in 2003 as a [[code fork]] of the [[Sodipodi]] project.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#how-did-inkscape-start | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on [[Raph Levien]]'s Gill (GNOME Illustration Application).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=12529 | title = Linux.com Interviews Lauris Kaplinski | publisher = Linux.com | date = 2001-09-24 | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Inkscape [[FAQ]] interprets the word ''Inkscape'' as a compound of ''ink'' and ''{{linktext|scape}}''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#What_does_%22Inkscape%22_mean? | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2016-02-10 | quote = What does 'Inkscape' mean? [...] The name is made up of the two English words 'ink' and 'scape'. Ink is a common substance for drawings, and is used when the sketched work is ready to be permanently committed to paper, and thus evokes the idea that Inkscape is ready for production work. A scape is a view of a large number of objects, such as a landscape or ocean-scape, and thus alludes to the object-oriented nature of vector imagery.}}</ref><ref>Compare {{linktext | -scape}}</ref>\n\nFour former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, [[Nathan Hurst]], and ''MenTaLguY'') led the fork; they identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements as their reasons for forking. With Inkscape, they said they would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized developing a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.<ref>{{cite web | title = Announcing new project (sodipodi mailing list) | url = http://sourceforge.net/p/sodipodi/mailman/message/10064135/ | date = 2003-11-06 | accessdate = 2015-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the fork, Inkscape's developers changed it greatly: they changed the programming language from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]]; adopted the [[GTK]] (formerly GIMP Toolkit) toolkit C++ bindings ([[gtkmm]]); redesigned its [[user interface]], and added a number of new features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SodiPodi#Inkscape_Sodipodi_Comparison | title = Inkscape Sodipodi Comparison | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Notably, Inkscape's implementation of the SVG standard, although incomplete, has shown gradual improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_SVG_features_does_Inkscape_implement.3F |title= Frequently asked questions - Inkscape Wiki |publisher= Wiki.inkscape.org |date= 2012-07-29 |accessdate= 2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Inkscape has participated in the [[Google Summer of Code]] program.<ref>{{cite web | title = Google's Summer of Code | publisher = Inkscape wiki | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704225718/http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | archivedate = 2007-07-04 }}</ref>\n\nUp until the end of November 2007, Inkscape's [[source code repository]] was hosted by [[SourceForge]]. Thereafter it moved to [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moving to Launchpad\n | url   = http://blog.launchpad.net/general/inkscape-moving-to-launchpad}}</ref> In June 2017, it moved to [[GitLab]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moves to GitLab\n | url   = https://inkscape.org/en/news/2017/06/10/inkscape-moves-gitlab/}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Object creation===\n[[File:Inkscape 0.48.2 with librsvg workarounds.svg|thumb|right|Inkscape 0.48.2, showing a rectangle (selected with the select tool), an ellipse, a star and two text objects]]\n\nInkscape workflow is based around vector objects. Included tools allow manipulating primitive vector shapes\u2014e.g. rectangles, ellipses and arcs\u2014and more complex objects, like 3D boxes with adjustable perspectives, stars, polygons and spirals. Inkscape also has rendering feature that can create objects like [[Barcode|barcodes]], calendars, grids, [[Gear|gears]] or [[Roulette (curve)|roulette curves]] (using [[spirograph]] tool). These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[Color gradient|color gradients]] and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. All of those can be further edited by transformations\u2014such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing\u2014or by editing paths.\n\nOther tools allow creating [[Composite B\u00e9zier curve|B\u00e9zier curves]], freehand drawing of lines (pencil), or calligraphic (brush-like) strokes which support a [[graphics tablet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/calligraphy/tutorial-calligraphy.html|title=Inkscape tutorial: Calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|website=inkscape.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nInkscape is able to write and edit text with tools available for changing font, spacing, kerning, rotation, flowing along the path or into a shape. Text can be converted to paths for further editing. The program also has a layers (as well as an objects) feature that allows the user to organize objects in a preferred stacking order in the canvas. Objects can be made visible/invisible and locked/unlocked through these features.\n\nSymbol libraries enable Inkscape to use existing symbols like [[Logic gate#Symbols|logic-gate symbols]] or [[DOT pictograms]]. Additional libraries can be included by user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SymbolsDialog|title=SymbolsDialog - Inkscape Wiki|website=wiki.inkscape.org|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nInkscape supports [[image tracing]], the process of extracting vector graphics from raster sources.\n\nClones are child objects of an original parent object. Different transformations can be applied to them, such as: size, position, rotation, blur, [[Alpha channel|opacity]], color and symmetry. Clones are updated live whenever the parent object changes.\n\n===Object manipulation===\nEvery object in the drawing can be subjected to arbitrary [[affine transformation]]s: moving, rotating, scaling, skewing and a configurable matrix{{Clarify|reason=matrix is not transformation. [[Affine transformation matrix]] is a thing. Does Inkscape support it?|date=December 2019}}. Transformation parameters can be specified numerically. Transformations can snap to angles, grids, guidelines and nodes of other objects, or be aligned in specified direction, spaced equally, scattered at random.\n\nObjects can be grouped together. Groups of objects behave similarly to objects. Objects in a group can be edited without having to ungroup them first.\n\nThe [[Z-order]] determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Objects with a high Z-order are drawn on top of objects lower in the Z-order. Order of objects can be managed either using layers, or by manually moving the object up and down in the Z-order. Layers can be locked or hidden, preventing modifying and accidental selection.\n\n''Create Tiled Clones'' tool allows to create symmetrical or grid-like drawings using various [[wallpaper group|plane symmetries]].\n\nAppearance of objects can be further changed by using [[image mask|masks]] and [[clipping path]]s, which can be created from arbitrary objects, including groups.\n\nThe style attributes are 'attached' to the source object, so after cutting/copying an object onto the clipboard, the style's attributes can be pasted to another object.\n\n===Operations on paths===\n{{Prose|date=January 2020|section}}{{Overly detailed|section|details=|date=January 2020}}\nInkscape has a comprehensive tool set to edit paths (as they are the basic element of a vector file):\n* ''Edit Path by Node tool'': allows for the editing of single or multiple paths and or their associated node(s). There are four types of path nodes; Cusp (corner), Smooth, Symmetric and Auto-Smooth. Editing is available for the positioning of nodes and their associated handles (angle and length) for Linear and [[Bezier curve|B\u00e9zier]] paths or [[Euler spiral|Spiro curves]]. A path segment can also be adjusted by dragging (left click + hold). When multiple nodes are selected, they can be moved, scaled and rotated using [[keyboard shortcut]] or mouse controls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inkscape Keyboard Layout|url=https://openclipart.org/detail/188861/inkscape-keyboard-layout-v0484|website=openclipart.org|publisher=creative commons|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Additional nodes can be inserted into paths at arbitrary or even placements, and an effect can be used to insert nodes at predefined intervals. When nodes are deleted, the handles on remaining ones are adjusted to preserve the original shape as closely as possible.\n* ''Tweak tool (sculpting/painting)'': provides whole object(s) or node editing regions (parts) of an object. It can push, repel/attract, randomize positioning, shrink/enlarge, rotate, copy/delete selected whole objects. With parts of a path you can push, shrink/enlarge, repel/attract, roughen edges, blur and color. Nodes are dynamically created and deleted when needed while using this tool, so it can also be used on simple paths without pre-processing.\n* ''Path-Offsets; Outset, Inset, Linked or Dynamic'': can create a Linked or Dynamic (unlinked) Inset and or an Outset of an existing path which can then be fine tuned using the given Shape or Node tool. Creating a Linked Offset of a path will update whenever the original is modified. Making symmetrical (i.e., picture frame) graphics easier to edit.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Object to Path'': conversions of Objects; Shapes (square, circle, etc.) or Text into paths.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Stroke to Path'': conversions of the Stroke of a shape to a path.\n* ''Path-Simplify'': a given path's node count will reduce while preserving the shape.\n* ''Path-Operations'' ([[Boolean algebra|boolean operations]]): use of multiple objects to Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division and Cut Path.\n\nInkscape includes a feature called ''Live Path Effects'' (LPE), which can apply various modifiers to a path. Envelope Deformation is available via the Path Effects and provides a perspective effect. There are more than a dozen of these live path effects. LPE can be stacked onto a single object and have interactive live on canvas and menu-based editing of the effects.\n\n===File formats===\n{{Update|type=section|date=January 2020|reason=Inkscape supports more formats}}\nInkscape's primary format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) version 1.1, meaning that it can create and edit with the abilities and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support [[Scalable Vector Graphics#Scripting and animation|animation]] natively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animation|url=https://inkscape.org/en/learn/animation/|website=Inkscape|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for [[complex scripts]]. Formats that used the UniConvertor library are not supported in the upcoming 1.0 release. A workaround is to have a parallel installation of version 0.92.x. <ref>https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/1.0#Dropped_Extensions</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Inkscape file format support\n!

(2Geom is a computational geometry library, originally developed for Inkscape. While developed for Inkscape it is a library that can be used from any application. It provides support for basic geometric algebra, paths, distortions, boolean operations, plotting implicit functions, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and more. 2Geom is free software released under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.)<ref>https://github.com/inkscape/lib2geom</ref><ref>https://inkscape.org/news/2018/11/11/graphics-math-library-2geoms-first-release-availab/</ref>\n\n==Interface and usability==\n{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=January 2020}}\nOne of the main priorities of the Inkscape project is interface consistency and [[usability]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#How_did_Inkscape_start? | title = Inkscape FAQ, How did Inkscape start? | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> This includes efforts to follow the [[GNOME]] [[human interface guidelines]], universal keyboard accessibility, and convenient on-canvas editing. Inkscape has achieved significant progress in usability since the project started.\n\nThe number of floating dialog boxes has been reduced, with their functions available using keyboard shortcuts or in the docked toolbars in the editing window. The tool bar controls at the top of the window always display the controls relevant to the current tool.\n\nAll vector transformations, scale, rotation and positioning (minus skewing) have keyboard shortcuts with consistent modifiers (<kbd>Alt</kbd> transforms by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom, <kbd>Shift</kbd> multiplies the transformation by 10, etc.). These keys work on nodes in Node tool as well as on objects in the Selector Tool. The most common operations (such as transformations, zooming, z-order) have convenient one-key shortcuts.\n\nInkscape provides ''mouse over'' tooltips and ''status bar'' hints for all buttons, controls, commands, keys, and on-canvas handles. The status bar hint messages are dynamic: A given object can display up to four hints while editing it with just one tool. The hints update based on two items \u2013 the tool being used, and the type of object/node/handle being edited\u2014text, shapes, paths, node types, etc. It comes with a complete keyboard and mouse reference (in HTML and SVG)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/doc/keys091.html | title = Inkscape keyboard and mouse reference | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> and several interactive tutorials in SVG.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/ | title = Inkscape tutorials web page | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref>\n\nThe interface of [[Sodipodi]] (Inkscape's predecessor) was based on those of [[CorelDRAW]] and [[GIMP]].

This software can be used to create or edit [[vector graphics]] such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos, icons and complex paintings. Inkscape's primary vector graphics format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG); however, many other formats can be imported and exported.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://inkscape.org/about/features/|title = Inkscape Features |accessdate = 13 January 2020|website = Inkscape.org }}</ref>\n\nInkscape can [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[color gradient]]s and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional [[image tracing|tracing]] of [[raster graphics]] is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\n\n==History==\nInkscape began in 2003 as a [[code fork]] of the [[Sodipodi]] project.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#how-did-inkscape-start | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on [[Raph Levien]]'s Gill (GNOME Illustration Application).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=12529 | title = Linux.com Interviews Lauris Kaplinski | publisher = Linux.com | date = 2001-09-24 | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Inkscape [[FAQ]] interprets the word ''Inkscape'' as a compound of ''ink'' and ''{{linktext|scape}}''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#What_does_%22Inkscape%22_mean? | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2016-02-10 | quote = What does 'Inkscape' mean? [...] The name is made up of the two English words 'ink' and 'scape'. Ink is a common substance for drawings, and is used when the sketched work is ready to be permanently committed to paper, and thus evokes the idea that Inkscape is ready for production work. A scape is a view of a large number of objects, such as a landscape or ocean-scape, and thus alludes to the object-oriented nature of vector imagery.}}</ref><ref>Compare {{linktext | -scape}}</ref>\n\nFour former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, [[Nathan Hurst]], and ''MenTaLguY'') led the fork; they identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements as their reasons for forking. With Inkscape, they said they would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized developing a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.<ref>{{cite web | title = Announcing new project (sodipodi mailing list) | url = http://sourceforge.net/p/sodipodi/mailman/message/10064135/ | date = 2003-11-06 | accessdate = 2015-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the fork, Inkscape's developers changed it greatly: they changed the programming language from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]]; adopted the [[GTK]] (formerly GIMP Toolkit) toolkit C++ bindings ([[gtkmm]]); redesigned its [[user interface]], and added a number of new features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SodiPodi#Inkscape_Sodipodi_Comparison | title = Inkscape Sodipodi Comparison | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Notably, Inkscape's implementation of the SVG standard, although incomplete, has shown gradual improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_SVG_features_does_Inkscape_implement.3F |title= Frequently asked questions - Inkscape Wiki |publisher= Wiki.inkscape.org |date= 2012-07-29 |accessdate= 2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Inkscape has participated in the [[Google Summer of Code]] program.<ref>{{cite web | title = Google's Summer of Code | publisher = Inkscape wiki | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704225718/http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | archivedate = 2007-07-04 }}</ref>\n\nUp until the end of November 2007, Inkscape's [[source code repository]] was hosted by [[SourceForge]]. Thereafter it moved to [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moving to Launchpad\n | url   = http://blog.launchpad.net/general/inkscape-moving-to-launchpad}}</ref> In June 2017, it moved to [[GitLab]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moves to GitLab\n | url   = https://inkscape.org/en/news/2017/06/10/inkscape-moves-gitlab/}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Object creation===\n[[File:Inkscape 0.48.2 with librsvg workarounds.svg|thumb|right|Inkscape 0.48.2, showing a rectangle (selected with the select tool), an ellipse, a star and two text objects]]\n\nInkscape workflow is based around vector objects. Included tools allow manipulating primitive vector shapes\u2014e.g. rectangles, ellipses and arcs\u2014and more complex objects, like 3D boxes with adjustable perspectives, stars, polygons and spirals. Inkscape also has rendering feature that can create objects like [[Barcode|barcodes]], calendars, grids, [[Gear|gears]] or [[Roulette (curve)|roulette curves]] (using [[spirograph]] tool). These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[Color gradient|color gradients]] and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. All of those can be further edited by transformations\u2014such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing\u2014or by editing paths.\n\nOther tools allow creating [[Composite B\u00e9zier curve|B\u00e9zier curves]], freehand drawing of lines (pencil), or calligraphic (brush-like) strokes which support a [[graphics tablet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/calligraphy/tutorial-calligraphy.html|title=Inkscape tutorial: Calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|website=inkscape.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nInkscape is able to write and edit text with tools available for changing font, spacing, kerning, rotation, flowing along the path or into a shape. Text can be converted to paths for further editing. The program also has a layers (as well as an objects) feature that allows the user to organize objects in a preferred stacking order in the canvas. Objects can be made visible/invisible and locked/unlocked through these features.\n\nSymbol libraries enable Inkscape to use existing symbols like [[Logic gate#Symbols|logic-gate symbols]] or [[DOT pictograms]]. Additional libraries can be included by user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SymbolsDialog|title=SymbolsDialog - Inkscape Wiki|website=wiki.inkscape.org|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nInkscape supports [[image tracing]], the process of extracting vector graphics from raster sources.\n\nClones are child objects of an original parent object. Different transformations can be applied to them, such as: size, position, rotation, blur, [[Alpha channel|opacity]], color and symmetry. Clones are updated live whenever the parent object changes.\n\n===Object manipulation===\nEvery object in the drawing can be subjected to arbitrary [[affine transformation]]s: moving, rotating, scaling, skewing and a configurable matrix{{Clarify|reason=matrix is not transformation. [[Affine transformation matrix]] is a thing. Does Inkscape support it?|date=December 2019}}. Transformation parameters can be specified numerically. Transformations can snap to angles, grids, guidelines and nodes of other objects, or be aligned in specified direction, spaced equally, scattered at random.\n\nObjects can be grouped together. Groups of objects behave similarly to objects. Objects in a group can be edited without having to ungroup them first.\n\nThe [[Z-order]] determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Objects with a high Z-order are drawn on top of objects lower in the Z-order. Order of objects can be managed either using layers, or by manually moving the object up and down in the Z-order. Layers can be locked or hidden, preventing modifying and accidental selection.\n\n''Create Tiled Clones'' tool allows to create symmetrical or grid-like drawings using various [[wallpaper group|plane symmetries]].\n\nAppearance of objects can be further changed by using [[image mask|masks]] and [[clipping path]]s, which can be created from arbitrary objects, including groups.\n\nThe style attributes are 'attached' to the source object, so after cutting/copying an object onto the clipboard, the style's attributes can be pasted to another object.\n\n===Operations on paths===\n{{Prose|date=January 2020|section}}{{Overly detailed|section|details=|date=January 2020}}\nInkscape has a comprehensive tool set to edit paths (as they are the basic element of a vector file):\n* ''Edit Path by Node tool'': allows for the editing of single or multiple paths and or their associated node(s). There are four types of path nodes; Cusp (corner), Smooth, Symmetric and Auto-Smooth. Editing is available for the positioning of nodes and their associated handles (angle and length) for Linear and [[Bezier curve|B\u00e9zier]] paths or [[Euler spiral|Spiro curves]]. A path segment can also be adjusted by dragging (left click + hold). When multiple nodes are selected, they can be moved, scaled and rotated using [[keyboard shortcut]] or mouse controls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inkscape Keyboard Layout|url=https://openclipart.org/detail/188861/inkscape-keyboard-layout-v0484|website=openclipart.org|publisher=creative commons|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Additional nodes can be inserted into paths at arbitrary or even placements, and an effect can be used to insert nodes at predefined intervals. When nodes are deleted, the handles on remaining ones are adjusted to preserve the original shape as closely as possible.\n* ''Tweak tool (sculpting/painting)'': provides whole object(s) or node editing regions (parts) of an object. It can push, repel/attract, randomize positioning, shrink/enlarge, rotate, copy/delete selected whole objects. With parts of a path you can push, shrink/enlarge, repel/attract, roughen edges, blur and color. Nodes are dynamically created and deleted when needed while using this tool, so it can also be used on simple paths without pre-processing.\n* ''Path-Offsets; Outset, Inset, Linked or Dynamic'': can create a Linked or Dynamic (unlinked) Inset and or an Outset of an existing path which can then be fine tuned using the given Shape or Node tool. Creating a Linked Offset of a path will update whenever the original is modified. Making symmetrical (i.e., picture frame) graphics easier to edit.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Object to Path'': conversions of Objects; Shapes (square, circle, etc.) or Text into paths.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Stroke to Path'': conversions of the Stroke of a shape to a path.\n* ''Path-Simplify'': a given path's node count will reduce while preserving the shape.\n* ''Path-Operations'' ([[Boolean algebra|boolean operations]]): use of multiple objects to Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division and Cut Path.\n\nInkscape includes a feature called ''Live Path Effects'' (LPE), which can apply various modifiers to a path. Envelope Deformation is available via the Path Effects and provides a perspective effect. There are more than a dozen of these live path effects. LPE can be stacked onto a single object and have interactive live on canvas and menu-based editing of the effects.\n\n===File formats===\n{{Update|type=section|date=January 2020|reason=Inkscape supports more formats}}\nInkscape's primary format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) version 1.1, meaning that it can create and edit with the abilities and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support [[Scalable Vector Graphics#Scripting and animation|animation]] natively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animation|url=https://inkscape.org/en/learn/animation/|website=Inkscape|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for [[complex scripts]]. Formats that used the UniConvertor library are not supported in the upcoming 1.0 release.

(2Geom is a computational geometry library, originally developed for Inkscape. While developed for Inkscape it is a library that can be used from any application. It provides support for basic geometric algebra, paths, distortions, boolean operations, plotting implicit functions, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and more. 2Geom is free software released under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.)<ref>https://github.com/inkscape/lib2geom</ref><ref>https://inkscape.org/news/2018/11/11/graphics-math-library-2geoms-first-release-availab/</ref>\n\n==Interface and usability==\n{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=January 2020}}\nOne of the main priorities of the Inkscape project is interface consistency and [[usability]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#How_did_Inkscape_start? | title = Inkscape FAQ, How did Inkscape start? | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> This includes efforts to follow the [[GNOME]] [[human interface guidelines]], universal keyboard accessibility, and convenient on-canvas editing. Inkscape has achieved significant progress in usability since the project started.\n\nThe number of floating dialog boxes has been reduced, with their functions available using keyboard shortcuts or in the docked toolbars in the editing window. The tool bar controls at the top of the window always display the controls relevant to the current tool.\n\nAll vector transformations, scale, rotation and positioning (minus skewing) have keyboard shortcuts with consistent modifiers (<kbd>Alt</kbd> transforms by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom, <kbd>Shift</kbd> multiplies the transformation by 10, etc.). These keys work on nodes in Node tool as well as on objects in the Selector Tool. The most common operations (such as transformations, zooming, z-order) have convenient one-key shortcuts.\n\nInkscape provides ''mouse over'' tooltips and ''status bar'' hints for all buttons, controls, commands, keys, and on-canvas handles. The status bar hint messages are dynamic: A given object can display up to four hints while editing it with just one tool. The hints update based on two items \u2013 the tool being used, and the type of object/node/handle being edited\u2014text, shapes, paths, node types, etc. It comes with a complete keyboard and mouse reference (in HTML and SVG)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/doc/keys091.html | title = Inkscape keyboard and mouse reference | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> and several interactive tutorials in SVG.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/ | title = Inkscape tutorials web page | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref>\n\nThe interface of [[Sodipodi]] (Inkscape's predecessor) was based on those of [[CorelDRAW]] and [[GIMP]]. The Inkscape interface has been influenced by [[Xara Xtreme]].\n\n==Platform support==\nThe latest version of Inkscape is available for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[OpenSUSE]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] platforms.<ref>[https://inkscape.org/en/download/ Download], Inkscape website</ref> Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available for Windows PCs.\n\nInkscape on macOS typically runs on [[XQuartz]], although the underlying [[GTK]] toolkit can be compiled to run natively under [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.flyn.org/apple/index.html | title = Open Source Macintosh Packages | publisher = Flyn Computing | date = 2006-12-29 | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090830162758/http://www.flyn.org/apple/index.html | archive-date = 2009-08-30 | url-status = dead }}</ref>{{Update inline|date=January 2020|reason=}}\n\nInkscape is packaged for all major [[Linux distribution]]s (including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE) with GTK+ 2.20+.\n\nWacom Tablet support for GTK 3 is in a reviving project.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://inkscape.org/en/news/2017/12/09/linux-tablet-driver-project-revived/ | title=Linux Tablet Driver Project Revived &#124; Inkscape}}</ref>\n\nThe main problems for transition to GTK 3 are no actual support for Windows and some hard problems in the migration to version 3.<ref> https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1723247</ref>\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
