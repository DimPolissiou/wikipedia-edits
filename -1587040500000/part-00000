Concrete and steel were used by the Americans and was found to be the suitable materials for the tropical environment. These were materialized by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr., a National Artist in creating the FEU campus buildings that reflected both the university's and the country's vision and showed his personal transition from Art Deco to the International Style.<ref name=\"Deco\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The buildings were constructed between the years 1939 to 1950.\n\n=== Heritage Buildings of FEU Manila Campus ===\n[[File:Far Eastern University Grand Stand..jpg|thumb|FEU Grandstand]]\n\n=== Nicanor B.

The outdoor stairs that joins the walkway at the second floor has layers of thin concrete slabs that swirl in waves above the rigid geometry of the handrail.\n\nThe physical envelope of the Main Building, now Nicanor B.

Pablo S. Antonio Sr. a decade after the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall.

It is the third building designed by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. also in the Art Deco Style. Constructed in 1941, it is used to house the Boys' High School which is originally an early basic education program of the university.\n\n=== Admission Building ===\nBuilt in 1940, the Admission Building is the mirror image of the Architecture & Fine Arts Building. The building was initially used by the Girls' High School and in 1983 became home to the Institute of Medicine (which now has its own campus in Fairview, Quezon City). In 2015 the building has been renovated and changed its name from FEU-East Asia College Building to the FEU Main Building which was used before by FEU-EAC students. Since there is a newly created building for EAC students they were transferred now to the FEU - Institute of Technology Building located just across FEU campus in Ricardo Papa street.\n\n'''<big>Science Building</big>'''\n\nThe seven-story building erected in 1950 was also designed by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. in what is considered a transition of style between Art Deco and the post World War 2 International Style. In 1990, an earthquake caused structural damages to the building making it necessary to demolish the top two floors. By the late 2013 a sixth floor was added.

Concrete and steel were used by the Americans and was found to be the suitable materials for the tropical environment. These were materialized by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr., a National Artist in creating the FEU campus buildings that reflected both the university's and the country's vision and showed his personal transition from Art Deco to the International Style.<ref name=\"Deco\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The buildings were constructed between the years 1939 to 1950.\n\n=== Heritage Buildings of FEU Manila Campus ===\n[[File:Far Eastern University Grand Stand..jpg|thumb|FEU Grandstand]]\n\n=== Nicanor B.

Constructed in 1941, it is used to house the Boys' High School which is originally an early basic education program of the university.\n\n=== Admission Building ===\nBuilt in 1940, the Admission Building is the mirror image of the Architecture & Fine Arts Building. The building was initially used by the Girls' High School and in 1983 became home to the Institute of Medicine (which now has its own campus in Fairview, Quezon City). In 2015 the building has been renovated and changed its name from FEU-East Asia College Building to the FEU Main Building which was used before by FEU-EAC students. Since there is a newly created building for EAC students they were transferred now to the FEU - Institute of Technology Building located just across FEU campus in Ricardo Papa street.\n\n'''<big>Science Building</big>'''\n\nThe seven-story building erected in 1950 was also designed by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. in what is considered a transition of style between Art Deco and the post World War 2 International Style. In 1990, an earthquake caused structural damages to the building making it necessary to demolish the top two floors. By the late 2013 a sixth floor was added.

Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD. | pmid=27453897 | volume=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25486626\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DM, Cates HM, Heller EA, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of chromatin states by drugs of abuse | journal = Curr.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}}</ref> Widespread [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone\u2013lysine acetylation]] in cortical [[astrocytes]] appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by ''T. gondii''.<ref name=\"T.

Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD. | pmid=27453897 | volume=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25486626\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DM, Cates HM, Heller EA, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of chromatin states by drugs of abuse | journal = Curr.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}}</ref> Widespread [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone\u2013lysine acetylation]] in cortical [[astrocytes]] appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by ''T. gondii''.<ref name=\"T.
