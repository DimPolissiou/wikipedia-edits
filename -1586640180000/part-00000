Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him \"The Father of Lies\".<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp; BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbors after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp; BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp; BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterward, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterward, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp; century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favorite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p.&nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref> According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\n[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]\n''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}</ref> Despite the controversy,<ref>{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198\u2013200}}</ref>{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they \"saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards\", although, being unaware of the existence of the southern hemisphere, he says that he does not believe the claim. Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/ |title=Herodotus on the First Circumnavigation of Africa |year=1996 |access-date=12 June 2019 |work=[[Livius.org]]}}\n</ref> His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_307.gif |title=The Indian Empire |work=[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]] |year=1909 |volume=2 |page=272 |via=[[Digital South Asia Library]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Jain\">{{cite book |last=Jain |first=Meenakshi |title=The India They Saw: Foreign Accounts |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=[[Prabhat Prakashan]] |location=Delhi |isbn=978-81-8430-106-9 |volume=1-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlMkBQAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |year=1981 |title=The Classical Accounts of India: Being a Compilation of the English Translations of the Accounts Left by Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, Quintus, Diodorus, Siculus, Justin, Plutarch, Frontinus, Nearchus, Apollonius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Aelian, and Others with Maps |location=Calcutta |publisher=Firma KLM |pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts/page/n523 504] |url=https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts |oclc=247581880}}</ref>\n\nDiscoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to Herodotus's credibility.

This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire.

A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''Histor\u00edai''), a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]\", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC [[Roman Empire|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes many obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus states that he is merely reporting what he has seen and heard. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''. The original title can be translated from the Greek as \"researches\" or \"inquiries\".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herodotus \"Herodotus\"] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography.'' The Gale Group. Retrieved March 11, 2018.</ref>}}\n\n{{quotation|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.|Herodotus, ''The Histories''<br>\nRobin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n===Predecessors===\nHis record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him \"The Father of Lies\".<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

Taylor and Francis. p.&nbsp;174</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a \"logos-writer\" (story-teller).<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}</ref> Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.<ref>Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). (1998). ''The Histories by Herodotus''. University of Oxford Press. \u201cIntroduction\u201d, p.&nbsp;xviii</ref> Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the ''[[polis]]'' or city-state.

The \"Wars of Liberation\" had given to Herodotus the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a Greek.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp;BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they \"saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards\", although, being unaware of the existence of the southern hemisphere, he says that he does not believe the claim.

The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called \"Naucratis stela\" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].\n[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]\n\nAfter journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry \"[[ant]]s\" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Marlise |last=Simons |author-link=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |access-date=23 February 2016 |page=5 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the \"ants\" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.\n\n===Accusations of bias===\nSome \"calumnious fictions\" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case \"a great collector of slanders\"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom ''Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''</ref> In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece.

A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

{"title_page": "Seniority", "text_new": "{{For|the order of repayment in the event of bankruptcy|Seniority (financial)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}\n'''Seniority''' is the concept of a person or group of people taking precedence over another person or group because the former is either older than the latter or has occupied a particular position longer than the latter. Seniority is present between parents and children and may be present in other common relationships, such as among siblings of different ages or between workers and their managers.\nThe fact of something being it's sincerely\nUnder a seniority system, control is often granted to senior persons due to length of service in a given position. When persons of senior rank have less length of service than their subordinates, \"seniority\" may apply to either concept.\n\n== In armed forces ==<!--linked from [[Adrian Johns]]-->\n\nIn some military [[command structure]]s, the length of time someone has held a particular rank is called \"seniority in grade\" and determines whether that person is senior to another person of the same [[military rank|rank]]. For instance, a captain who was promoted five years ago can give orders to a captain who was promoted three years ago.\n\n== In politics ==\n\nSeniority in [[United States politics]], when used out of context, is informally defined as the number of years one member of a group has been a part of the group. For example, as of January 2015, [[John Conyers]] from [[Michigan]] is the most senior member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref>http://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/seniority</ref> However, \"seniority\" can also refer to political power attained by position within the United States Government. For further details, see:\n* [[United States Order of Precedence]]\n* [[United States Presidential Line of Succession]]\n* [[Seniority in the United States Senate]]\n* [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]]\nSeniority is viewed sometimes both positively and negatively. Many elected officials are viewed as retaining their position only because they have been there for many years, which can reflect voter stagnancy and the benefits of incumbency. On the other hand, long years of [[Incumbent|incumbency]] can also be seen as a sign of the person's ability to continue pleasing voters or the use of seniority to deliver benefits to constituents.\n\nIn some countries the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]] receives special treatment.\n\n== In employment ==\nIn [[trade union|unionised]] companies, employees with more seniority may enjoy more work privileges.<ref>https://smallbusiness.chron.com/seniority-important-union-13338.html</ref> Here are examples: \n* [[Shift work]] at more favourable times\n* Work that is deemed easier or more pleasurable\n* Working hours at a more convenient time (convenience being relative to the employee)\n* Assignment to work, when a work reduction, or a reduction in available work hours results in layoffs\n\nSeniority also has an influence over [[bump (union)|bumping]] rights, which is a reassignment of jobs, possibly for many people at a time.\n\nSome traditionalist employers, common in smaller, single-operated business, take a \"last in, first out\" ([[LIFO (education)|LIFO]]) perspective, meaning those who have been there longest or who have [[tenure]] have the right to stay, whereas other employers take a \"first in, first out\" ([[FIFO (disambiguation)|FIFO]]) or \"inverse seniority\" viewpoint, which tends to emphasize a new or \"fresh start\" for the company.<ref>https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-seniority-means-at-work-1919372</ref>\n\nSeniority does have several positive factors to its name.  Individuals may be drawn toward a specific field or occupation with the knowledge that seniority is obtainable.  If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers.  Seniority does an effective job in helping people, interested in staying at one organization, in working towards having a \"marathon\" career.  One of the goals of a seniority system is [[employee retention]], which ensures an organization is retaining institutional knowledge, erudite employees, and an opportunity for [[mentorship]] of new hires.  It's important to make sure employees are here to stay. \n\nThough the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, in some scenarios, it can fail to address several critical factors.  Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives.  Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment.

Seniority is present between parents and children and may be present in other common relationships, such as among siblings of different ages or between workers and their managers.\n\nUnder a seniority system, control is often granted to senior persons due to length of service in a given position. When persons of senior rank have less length of service than their subordinates, \"seniority\" may apply to either concept.\n\n== In armed forces ==<!--linked from [[Adrian Johns]]-->\n\nIn some military [[command structure]]s, the length of time someone has held a particular rank is called \"seniority in grade\" and determines whether that person is senior to another person of the same [[military rank|rank]]. For instance, a captain who was promoted five years ago can give orders to a captain who was promoted three years ago.\n\n== In politics ==\n\nSeniority in [[United States politics]], when used out of context, is informally defined as the number of years one member of a group has been a part of the group. For example, as of January 2015, [[John Conyers]] from [[Michigan]] is the most senior member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref>http://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/seniority</ref> However, \"seniority\" can also refer to political power attained by position within the United States Government. For further details, see:\n* [[United States Order of Precedence]]\n* [[United States Presidential Line of Succession]]\n* [[Seniority in the United States Senate]]\n* [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]]\nSeniority is viewed sometimes both positively and negatively. Many elected officials are viewed as retaining their position only because they have been there for many years, which can reflect voter stagnancy and the benefits of incumbency. On the other hand, long years of [[Incumbent|incumbency]] can also be seen as a sign of the person's ability to continue pleasing voters or the use of seniority to deliver benefits to constituents.\n\nIn some countries the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]] receives special treatment.\n\n== In employment ==\nIn [[trade union|unionised]] companies, employees with more seniority may enjoy more work privileges.<ref>https://smallbusiness.chron.com/seniority-important-union-13338.html</ref> Here are examples: \n* [[Shift work]] at more favourable times\n* Work that is deemed easier or more pleasurable\n* Working hours at a more convenient time (convenience being relative to the employee)\n* Assignment to work, when a work reduction, or a reduction in available work hours results in layoffs\n\nSeniority also has an influence over [[bump (union)|bumping]] rights, which is a reassignment of jobs, possibly for many people at a time.\n\nSome traditionalist employers, common in smaller, single-operated business, take a \"last in, first out\" ([[LIFO (education)|LIFO]]) perspective, meaning those who have been there longest or who have [[tenure]] have the right to stay, whereas other employers take a \"first in, first out\" ([[FIFO (disambiguation)|FIFO]]) or \"inverse seniority\" viewpoint, which tends to emphasize a new or \"fresh start\" for the company.<ref>https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-seniority-means-at-work-1919372</ref>\n\nSeniority does have several positive factors to its name.  Individuals may be drawn toward a specific field or occupation with the knowledge that seniority is obtainable.  If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers.  Seniority does an effective job in helping people, interested in staying at one organization, in working towards having a \"marathon\" career.  One of the goals of a seniority system is [[employee retention]], which ensures an organization is retaining institutional knowledge, erudite employees, and an opportunity for [[mentorship]] of new hires.  It's important to make sure employees are here to stay. \n\nThough the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, in some scenarios, it can fail to address several critical factors.  Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives.  Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment.  Secondly, the security of [[tenure]] often encourages mediocrity. <ref>https://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/pros-cons-union-jobs-1.aspx</ref> Employees with the knowledge that their spot in the workplace is secured will naturally become less likely to improve their working ethics as they may no longer view improvement as a necessity.

Solubility of metals affects bioavailability of the species and mobility soil and groundwater systems.  Most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations, therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility.\n\nGranular MgO is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material, which is also commonly of a low (acidic) pH, in order to drive the pH into the 8\u201310 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities.  Metal-hydroxide complexes have a tendency to precipitate out of aqueous solution in the pH range of 8\u201310. MgO is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to Portland cement, lime, kiln dust products, power generation waste products, and various proprietary products due to MgO's superior buffering capacity, cost effectiveness, and ease/safety of handling.\n\nMost, if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high pH conditions in aquifers whereas MgO creates an ideal aquifer condition with a pH of 8\u201310.   Additionally, magnesium, an essential element to most biological systems, is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during MgO-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit.\n\n===Medical===\nMagnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia, as an antacid, magnesium supplement, and as a short-term [[laxative]].

Solubility of metals affects bioavailability of the species and mobility soil and groundwater systems.  Most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations, therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility.\n\nGranular MgO is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material, which is also commonly of a low (acidic) pH, in order to drive the pH into the 8\u201310 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities.  Metal-hydroxide complexes have a tendency to precipitate out of aqueous solution in the pH range of 8\u201310. MgO is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to Portland cement, lime, kiln dust products, power generation waste products, and various proprietary products due to MgO's superior buffering capacity, cost effectiveness, and ease/safety of handling.\n\nMost, if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high pH conditions in aquifers whereas MgO creates an ideal aquifer condition with a pH of 8\u201310.   Additionally, magnesium, an essential element to most biological systems, is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during MgO-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit.\n\n===Medical===\nMagnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia, as an antacid, magnesium supplement, and as a short-term [[laxative]].

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny).

Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre\u2013World War II era.

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.
