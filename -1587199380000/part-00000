The album features an acoustic performance recorded at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City on November 18, 1993, for the television series ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The show was directed by [[Beth McCarthy-Miller|Beth McCarthy]] and aired on the cable television network [[MTV]] on December 16, 1993. In a break with ''MTV Unplugged'' convention, Nirvana played mainly lesser-known material and covers of songs by the [[The Vaselines|Vaselines]], [[David Bowie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Meat Puppets]], whose members [[Cris Kirkwood|Cris]] and [[Curt Kirkwood]] joined Nirvana onstage.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of another live album'', [[Verse Chorus Verse (Nirvana album)|Verse Chorus Verse]], MTV Unplugged in New York'' was the first Nirvana album released following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Kurt Cobain]]. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and is Nirvana's most successful posthumous release, having been certified [[Platinum album|5x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= Search \"Nirvana\" -RIAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018181243/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= |date=2015-10-18 }} riaa.com.

The rehearsals were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV about the performance. Producer [[Alex Coletti]] recalled that the network was unhappy with the lack of hit Nirvana songs, and with the choice of the Meat Puppets as guests, saying: \"They wanted to hear the 'right' names - [[Eddie Vedder]] or [[Tori Amos]] or God knows who.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\">di Perna, Alan. \"Season Finale\". ''Guitar World''. March 1995.</ref> \n\nThe day before filming, Cobain refused to play, but he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from [[drug withdrawal]] and nervousness at the time; one observer said, \"There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him&nbsp;... everyone was more than a little worried about his performance.\"<ref name=\"Cross302\" />\n\n== Recording ==\nNirvana taped their performance on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain suggested that the stage be decorated with [[Lilium 'Stargazer'|stargazer lilies]], black candles, and a crystal [[chandelier]]. The show's producer asked him, \"You mean like a funeral?\", to which Cobain replied, \"Exactly. Like a funeral.\"<ref name=\"Cross304\">Cross, p. 304</ref> \n\nNirvana was augmented by guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and cellist [[Lori Goldston]], who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's acoustic premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his [[amplifier]] and [[effects pedals]]. Coletti built a fake box in front of the amplifier to disguise it as a [[stage monitor system|monitor wedge]]. Coletti said, \"It was Kurt's security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his [[Fender amplifier|Fender]]. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on 'The Man Who Sold the World'. It's an acoustic guitar, but he's obviously going through an amp.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\" />\n\nUnlike many artists who appeared on the show, Nirvana filmed the entire performance in a single take.<ref name=\"Witness\">\"Bare Witness: Nirvana Unplugged\".

The set ended with a performance of the traditional song \"[[In the Pines#Mark Lanegan/Nirvana|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]]\", following the arrangement of [[blues]] musician [[Lead Belly]], whom Cobain described before the song as \"his favorite performer ever\". After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not better the performance of that song.<ref>Cross, p. 305</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe Nirvana episode of ''MTV Unplugged'' was first broadcast in December 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1717577/nirvana-unplugged-20-anniversary-behind-the-scenes/|title='Nirvana: Unplugged' Turns 20 -- Go Behind The Scenes Of The Performance That Changed Everything|date=November 15, 2013|work=mtv.com|accessdate=October 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030191941/http://www.mtv.com/news/1717577/nirvana-unplugged-20-anniversary-behind-the-scenes/|archive-date=October 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was 45 minutes long and omitted the songs \"Something in the Way\" and \"Oh, Me.\" After [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain was found dead]] in April 1994, MTV aired the episode repeatedly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDB103EF930A25752C1A962958260&scp=12&sq=Nirvana+unplugged&st=nyt|title=Pop Music; A Simple Song That Lives Beyond Time|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 13, 1994|accessdate=June 26, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207234101/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDB103EF930A25752C1A962958260&scp=12&sq=Nirvana+unplugged&st=nyt|archive-date=December 7, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> To meet demand for new Nirvana material and to counter [[Bootleg (music)|bootlegging]], in August 1994, DGC announced in a double album, ''[[Verse Chorus Verse (Nirvana album)|Verse Chorus Verse]]'', comprising live performances including the entire ''MTV Unplugged'' performance.

Producer [[Alex Coletti]] recalled that the network was unhappy with the lack of hit Nirvana songs, and with the choice of the Meat Puppets as guests, saying: \"They wanted to hear the 'right' names - [[Eddie Vedder]] or [[Tori Amos]] or God knows who.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\">di Perna, Alan. \"Season Finale\". ''Guitar World''. March 1995.</ref> \n\nThe day before filming, Cobain refused to play, but he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from [[drug withdrawal]] and nervousness at the time; one observer said, \"There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him&nbsp;... everyone was more than a little worried about his performance.\"<ref name=\"Cross302\" />\n\n== Recording ==\nNirvana taped their performance on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain suggested that the stage be decorated with [[Lilium 'Stargazer'|stargazer lilies]], black candles, and a crystal [[chandelier]]. The show's producer asked him, \"You mean like a funeral?\", to which Cobain replied, \"Exactly. Like a funeral.\"<ref name=\"Cross304\">Cross, p. 304</ref> \n\nNirvana was augmented by guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and cellist [[Lori Goldston]], who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's acoustic premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his [[amplifier]] and [[effects pedals]]. Coletti built a fake box in front of the amplifier to disguise it as a [[stage monitor system|monitor wedge]]. Coletti said, \"It was Kurt's security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his [[Fender amplifier|Fender]]. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on 'The Man Who Sold the World'. It's an acoustic guitar, but he's obviously going through an amp.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\" />\n\nUnlike many artists who appeared on the show, Nirvana filmed the entire performance in a single take.<ref name=\"Witness\">\"Bare Witness: Nirvana Unplugged\".

The set ended with a performance of the traditional song \"[[In the Pines#Mark Lanegan/Nirvana|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]]\", following the arrangement of [[blues]] musician [[Lead Belly]], whom Cobain described before the song as \"his favorite performer ever\". After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not better the performance of that song.<ref>Cross, p. 305</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe Nirvana episode of ''MTV Unplugged'' was first broadcast in December 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1717577/nirvana-unplugged-20-anniversary-behind-the-scenes/|title='Nirvana: Unplugged' Turns 20 -- Go Behind The Scenes Of The Performance That Changed Everything|date=November 15, 2013|work=mtv.com|accessdate=October 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030191941/http://www.mtv.com/news/1717577/nirvana-unplugged-20-anniversary-behind-the-scenes/|archive-date=October 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was 45 minutes long and omitted the songs \"Something in the Way\" and \"Oh, Me.\" After [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain was found dead]] in April 1994, MTV aired the episode repeatedly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDB103EF930A25752C1A962958260&scp=12&sq=Nirvana+unplugged&st=nyt|title=Pop Music; A Simple Song That Lives Beyond Time|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 13, 1994|accessdate=June 26, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207234101/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDB103EF930A25752C1A962958260&scp=12&sq=Nirvana+unplugged&st=nyt|archive-date=December 7, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> To meet demand for new Nirvana material and to counter [[Bootleg (music)|bootlegging]], in August 1994, DGC announced in a double album, ''[[Verse Chorus Verse (Nirvana album)|Verse Chorus Verse]]'', comprising live performances including the entire ''MTV Unplugged'' performance.

R. R. Tolkien]], Oxford academic and author of the [[fantasy]] books ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nThe Tolkien family originated in the [[East Prussia]]n town [[Kreuzburg, East Prussia|Kreuzburg]] near [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], where the Tolkien name is attested since the 16th century. The verified paternal line of J. R. R. Tolkien starts with Michel Tolkien, born around 1620 in Kreuzburg. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby [[Danzig]], and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s, and became the ancestors of the English family. The family first appears in English records in 1777. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Their German nephew Daniel Gottlieb Bergmann also joined them in London. Johann (John) Benjamin Tolkien, who died in London in 1819, was the 2nd great-grandfather of J. R. R. Tolkien.<ref name=\"Derdzi\u0144ski1\">Ryszard Derdzi\u0144ski, [https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/15041/Z%20Prus%20do%20Anglii.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Z Prus do Anglii.

R. R. Tolkien, was born in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa. The climate did not suit the young J. R. R. Tolkien and his mother took both her sons to visit her parents in [[Kings Heath]] in Birmingham. When her husband died in 1896 she decided to stay back in England with her sons. They moved to [[Sarehole]], a village then outside Birmingham, in 1896. As a child, J. R. R. Tolkien used to tell stories to his younger brother Hilary, making ogres out of the adult people in the village. Ronald nicknamed the flour-coated miller's son in the nearby Sarehole Mill ''The White Ogre''. A farmer who used to terrorise children intruding on his land was nicknamed as the ''Black Ogre''. He once chased Ronald for plucking mushrooms from his farm. Hilary wrote the stories, letters and reminiscences of past times in a notebook during his twilight years. The contents of the notebook were published as a book titled ''Black & White Ogre Country: The Lost Tales of Hilary Tolkien'' in 2009. In 1902, the family moved to 26 Oliver Road in [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]] and later they both joined [[St. Philip's School]] in Birmingham. However, they soon left the school and their mother started teaching them at home. In 1904, both brothers contracted [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]]. Owing to the poor condition of their house on Oliver Road, Hilary also contracted [[pneumonia]]. When their mother became ill with diabetes, Ronald was sent to live with his aunt Jane's fianc\u00e9 and future husband Edwin Neave. Hilary was sent to stay with his maternal grandparents, the Suffields. After the death of their mother they were raised by Fr Francis Morgan. Hilary later passed an entrance examination and joined [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] in 1905 where his elder brother also studied. Hilary left school in 1910 and later helped his aunt Jane Neave run Phoenix Farm in the village of [[Gedling]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Hilary, his brother, aunt Jane and members of the Brookes-Smith family made a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1911. In late September 1914, J. R. R. Tolkien stayed with his aunt and brother at the farm for a few days. In 1914 during [[World War I]], Hilary enlisted in the [[British Army]] with the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] as a [[bugler]] and was wounded in 1916. After his military service, Hilary returned to Gedling and, in 1922, bought an orchard and market garden near [[Evesham]], ancestral town of his mother's family. In 1923, J. R. R. Tolkien, along with his wife and children, went to stay with Hilary for a while. A few months before his death, he visited Hilary in Evesham. Hilary married Magdalen Matthews in 1928. They had three sons. The first, Gabriel, was born in 1931, the second, Julian, in 1935, and the third, Paul, in 1938.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M4qRVI6PDNWfugTUnICwBg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 57]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Duriez|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gvfl1RMKW-YC&pg=PA4&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5ZKRVIXkEcOHuAS08oCwCg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 4]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Atherton|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=klFlBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M4qRVI6PDNWfugTUnICwBg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 9]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AErAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yJORVJ-SEM_iuQSCnoGYDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=hilary&f=false p. 8]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=by0dzzQ6m8sC&pg=PA455#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 455]}}</ref><ref name=\"WO 2001\">{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/307760.display/ |title=Related to Tolkien |first=Sandra |last=Carter |work=[[Watford Observer]] |date=14 December 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |title=J.

R. R. Tolkien]], Oxford academic and author of the [[fantasy]] books ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nThe Tolkien family originated in the [[East Prussia]]n town [[Kreuzburg, East Prussia|Kreuzburg]] near [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], where the Tolkien name is attested since the 16th century. The verified paternal line of J. R. R. Tolkien starts with Michel Tolkien, born around 1620 in Kreuzburg. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby [[Danzig]], and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s, and became the ancestors of the English family. The family first appears in English records in 1777. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Their German nephew Daniel Gottlieb Bergmann also joined them in London. Johann (John) Benjamin Tolkien, who died in London in 1819, was the 2nd great-grandfather of J. R. R. Tolkien.<ref name=\"Derdzi\u0144ski1\">Ryszard Derdzi\u0144ski, [https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/15041/Z%20Prus%20do%20Anglii.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Z Prus do Anglii.

The Suffield family had a business in a building called Lamb House since 1812.

Both were orphans. The two fell in love, despite Bratt being Tolkien's senior by three years. Before the end of 1909 the relationship became known to Tolkien's guardian, Father Francis Xavier Morgan, who forbade Tolkien to see Bratt until he was 21.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-earth |first=John |last=Garth |year=2013 |page=12 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |isbn=978-0-54426-372-7 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=rMiUN8qeOBoC&lpg=PA366&dq=Tolkien%20and%20the%20Great%20War%20garth&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q=Francis%20Morgan&f=false}}</ref> With one exception, Tolkien obeyed this instruction to the letter while Father Morgan's guardianship lasted.

R. R. Tolkien, was born in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa. The climate did not suit the young J. R. R. Tolkien and his mother took both her sons to visit her parents in [[Kings Heath]] in Birmingham. When her husband died in 1896 she decided to stay back in England with her sons. They moved to [[Sarehole]], a village then outside Birmingham, in 1896. As a child, J. R. R. Tolkien used to tell stories to his younger brother Hilary, making ogres out of the adult people in the village. Ronald nicknamed the flour-coated miller's son in the nearby Sarehole Mill ''The White Ogre''. A farmer who used to terrorise children intruding on his land was nicknamed as the ''Black Ogre''. He once chased Ronald for plucking mushrooms from his farm. Hilary wrote the stories, letters and reminiscences of past times in a notebook during his twilight years. The contents of the notebook were published as a book titled ''Black & White Ogre Country: The Lost Tales of Hilary Tolkien'' in 2009. In 1902, the family moved to 26 Oliver Road in [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]] and later they both joined [[St. Philip's School]] in Birmingham. However, they soon left the school and their mother started teaching them at home. In 1904, both brothers contracted [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]]. Owing to the poor condition of their house on Oliver Road, Hilary also contracted [[pneumonia]]. When their mother became ill with diabetes, Ronald was sent to live with his aunt Jane's fianc\u00e9 and future husband Edwin Neave. Hilary was sent to stay with his maternal grandparents, the Suffields. After the death of their mother they were raised by Fr Francis Morgan. Hilary later passed an entrance examination and joined [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] in 1905 where his elder brother also studied. Hilary left school in 1910 and later helped his aunt Jane Neave run Phoenix Farm in the village of [[Gedling]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Hilary, his brother, aunt Jane and members of the Brookes-Smith family made a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1911. In late September 1914, J. R. R. Tolkien stayed with his aunt and brother at the farm for a few days. In 1914 during [[World War I]], Hilary enlisted in the [[British Army]] with the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] as a [[bugler]] and was wounded in 1916. After his military service, Hilary returned to Gedling and, in 1922, bought an orchard and market garden near [[Evesham]], ancestral town of his mother's family. In 1923, J. R. R. Tolkien, along with his wife and children, went to stay with Hilary for a while. A few months before his death, he visited Hilary in Evesham. Hilary married Magdalen Matthews in 1928. They had three sons. The first, Gabriel, was born in 1931, the second, Julian, in 1935, and the third, Paul, in 1938.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M4qRVI6PDNWfugTUnICwBg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 57]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Duriez|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gvfl1RMKW-YC&pg=PA4&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5ZKRVIXkEcOHuAS08oCwCg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 4]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Atherton|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=klFlBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M4qRVI6PDNWfugTUnICwBg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=hilary%20tolkien&f=false p. 9]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AErAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=hilary+tolkien&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yJORVJ-SEM_iuQSCnoGYDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=hilary&f=false p. 8]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=by0dzzQ6m8sC&pg=PA455#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 455]}}</ref><ref name=\"WO 2001\">{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/307760.display/ |title=Related to Tolkien |first=Sandra |last=Carter |work=[[Watford Observer]] |date=14 December 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |title=J.

He was educated at the [[Dragon School]], Oxford and [[The Oratory School]] in [[Caversham, Berkshire]] where in his final year he decided to become a priest. On the advice of the Archbishop he decided to go to college to study English and joined [[Exeter College, Oxford]] from where he received his B.A. degree in 1939. In November 1939, he went to the [[English College, Rome]] to train as a priest. Due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], the college was moved to [[Stonyhurst]] in [[Lancashire]] where John trained as a priest during the war. He was ordained as a priest at St John and Augustine Church in [[North Oxford]]. His first position was as a [[curate]] from 1946 to 1950 at the St Mary and St Benedict Church in [[Coventry]] where he taught weekly classes to 60 children and organized the building of church schools. From 1950 to 1957, he was a curate at the English Martyrs Church in [[Sparkhill]], [[Birmingham]]. Thereafter he moved to [[North Staffordshire]], where he was the chaplain of University College of North Staffordshire, now [[Keele University]] and at two grammar schools, [[St Joseph's College, Stoke-on-Trent|St Joseph's College]], [[Trent Vale]] and St Dominic's High School, [[Hartshill]]. He was parish priest at Knutton Roman Catholic Church from 1957 to 1966. In 1966, he became the parish priest at [[Our Lady of the Angels and St Peter in Chains Church, Stoke-on-Trent]]. He held the position until 1987 and there oversaw the building of a new school. He was chairman of governors at Bishop Bright School, chaplain to the North Staffordshire Catholic Teachers Association and area chaplain to the Young Christian Students. He moved back to Oxford in 1987, settling in [[Eynsham]] where he was the parish priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church until his retirement in 1994.

Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925.</ref>\n\nCronus was usually depicted with a [[harpe]], [[scythe]] or a [[sickle]], which was the instrument he used to [[castrate]] and depose Uranus, his father. In [[Athens]], on the twelfth day of the Attic month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]], a festival called [[Kronia]] was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a [[List of agricultural gods|patron of the harvest]]. Cronus was also identified in [[classical antiquity]] with the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].\n\n== Mythology ==\nIn an ancient myth recorded by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus's mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed [[Hecatoncheires]] and one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], in [[Tartarus]], so that they would not see the light. Gaia created [[harpe|a great stone sickle]] and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 154\u2013166].</ref>\n\n[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio Vasari]]: The Mutilation of Uranus by Saturn (Cronus)|233x233px]]\n\nOnly Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush.<ref> [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 167\u2013206.] .</ref> When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, [[castration|castrating]] him and casting his [[testicles]] into the sea. From the [[blood]] that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the [[Gigantes]], [[Erinyes]], and [[Meliae]] were produced.

He and his older sister [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the [[golden age|Golden Age]], as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.\n\n[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] of Cronus devouring one of his children]]\n\nCronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]] by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, [[Zeus]], was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children. See more about the rebellion of Kronos against Oaranus here:https://notionpress.com/read/terrific-terror-and-the-weakening-mist\n\nRhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in [[Crete]], and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the [[Omphalos]] Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.\n\nRhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on [[Mount Ida, Crete]]. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], while a company of [[Korybantes|Kouretes]], armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the [[nymph]] [[Adamanthea]], who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.\n\nOnce he had grown up, Zeus used an [[emetic]] given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of [[Mount Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1].</ref>\n\nAfter freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. In a vast war called the [[Titanomachy]], Zeus and his older brothers and older sisters, with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in [[Tartarus]]. However, Oceanus, Helios, Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy.  Gaia bore the monster [[Typhon]] to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans.\n\nAccounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In [[Homer]]ic and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of [[Elysium]] by Zeus. In another version,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Vergil |author=Vergil |title=[[Aeneid]] |chapter=Book&nbsp;VIII, pp&nbsp;323&nbsp;ff |chapter-url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.8.viii.html}}</ref> it is [[Latium]] to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus).\n\nOne other account referred by [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves, Robert, ''Hebrew Myths'' 21.4</ref> who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer [[Tzetzes]], it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote).\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'', [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]], 1596-1598]]\n\n=== Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus ===\n\nIn a Libyan account related by [[Diodorus Siculus]] (Book 3), Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans. Ammon, a king of [[Libya]], married Rhea (3.18.1).  However, Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus.  With Rhea's incitement, Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon, who fled to Crete (3.71.1-2). Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon's son Dionysus (3.71.3-3.73) who appointed Cronus' and Rhea's son, Zeus, as king of Egypt (3.73.4). Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Dionysus, Zeus inherited all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world (3.73.7-8).\n\n=== Sibylline Oracles ===\nCronus is mentioned in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', particularly in book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus's and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at [[Dodona]], Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to [[Phrygia]] to be raised in the care of three Cretans. Upon learning this, sixty of Titan's men then imprison Cronus and Rhea, causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them. This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children.\n\n=== Other accounts ===\nCronus was said to be the father of the wise centaur Chiron by the [[Oceanid]] [[Philyra (Oceanid)|Philyra]] who was later on, transformed into a linden tree.<ref>[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 1200</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7. 197</ref><ref name=\":0\">[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2.1235 citing [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]]</ref> The Titan chased the nymph and consorted with her in the shape of a stallion, hence the half-human, half-equine shape of their offspring;<ref>[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2. 1231 ff</ref><ref>[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 1. 554</ref> this was said to have taken place on Mount [[Pelion]].<ref>Callimachus, Hymn 4 to [[Delos]] 104 ff</ref>\n\nTwo other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been [[Dolops]]<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', Preface</ref> and Aphrus, the ancestor and [[eponym]] of the Aphroi, i.e. the native [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]].<ref>[[Suda]] s.v.

English ''[[:wikt:shear|shear]]''), motivated by Cronus's characteristic act of \"cutting the sky\" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus).\nThe Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is ''kar'', generally meaning \"to make, create\" (whence ''[[karma]]''), but Janda argues that the original meaning \"to cut\" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the [[Rigveda]] pertaining to [[Indra]]'s heroic \"cutting\", like that of Cronus resulting in creation:\n\n{{quote|quote=[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].104.10 ''{{IAST|\u0101rdayad v\u1e5btram ak\u1e5b\u1e47od uloka\u1e43}}''<br/>he hit [[Vrtra]] fatally, cutting [> creating] a free path.<br/>\n[[Mandala 6|RV 6]].47.4 ''{{IAST|var\u1e63m\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 divo ak\u1e5b\u1e47od}}''<br/>he cut [> created] the loftiness of the sky.}}\n\nThis may point to an older [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European mytheme]] reconstructed as ''{{PIE|*(s)kert wersmn diwos}}'' \"by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky\".<ref>Michael Janda, ''Die Musik nach dem Chaos'', Innsbruck, 2010, 54-56.</ref>\nThe myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the ''[[Song of Kumarbi]]'', where  [[Anu (god)|Anu]] (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi.

This version gives his alternate name as ''Elus'' or ''Ilus'', and states that in the 32nd year of his reign, he emasculated, slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon \"whom they afterwards called Uranus\". It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed [[Attica]] to his own daughter [[Athena]], and [[Egypt]] to [[Taautus]] the son of [[Misor]] and inventor of writing.<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea: ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' Book 1, Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n=== Roman mythology and later culture ===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\n\n[[File:ForumRomanum.jpg|thumb|right|4th-century Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the [[Roman Forum]].]]\nWhile the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. The [[Saturnalia]] was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one [[Temple of Saturn|temple to Saturn]] already existed in the archaic [[Roman Kingdom]].\n\nHis association with the \"Saturnian\" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of \"time\", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests\u2014not now confused with [[Chronos]], the unrelated embodiment of time in general. Nevertheless, among [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] scholars in Alexandria and during the [[Renaissance]], Cronus was conflated with the name of ''[[Chronos]]'', the personification of \"[[Father Time]]\",<ref name=\"perseus.tufts\" /> wielding the harvesting scythe.\n\nAs a result of Cronus's importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on [[Western culture]]. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in [[Latin]] ''Dies Saturni'' (\"Day of Saturn\"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''Saturday''.

He overthrew his father and ruled during the mythological [[Golden Age]], until he was overthrown by his own son [[Zeus]] and imprisoned in [[Tartarus]].

Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925.</ref>\n\nCronus was usually depicted with a [[harpe]], [[scythe]] or a [[sickle]], which was the instrument he used to [[castrate]] and depose Uranus, his father. In [[Athens]], on the twelfth day of the Attic month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]], a festival called [[Kronia]] was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a [[List of agricultural gods|patron of the harvest]]. Cronus was also identified in [[classical antiquity]] with the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].\n\n== Mythology ==\nIn an ancient myth recorded by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus's mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed [[Hecatoncheires]] and one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], in [[Tartarus]], so that they would not see the light. Gaia created [[harpe|a great stone sickle]] and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 154\u2013166].</ref>\n\n[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio Vasari]]: The Mutilation of Uranus by Saturn (Cronus)|233x233px]]\n\nOnly Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush.<ref> [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 167\u2013206.] .</ref> When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, [[castration|castrating]] him and casting his [[testicles]] into the sea. From the [[blood]] that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the [[Gigantes]], [[Erinyes]], and [[Meliae]] were produced. The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess [[Aphrodite]] emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons ''Titenes''<ref group=lower-alpha>\u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2; according to Hesiod meaning \"straining ones,\" the source of the word \"titan\", but this etymology is disputed.</ref> for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act.<ref group=lower-alpha>in an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan [[Ophion]] and in doing so he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes and set the dragon [[Campe]] to guard them. He and his older sister [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the [[golden age|Golden Age]], as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.\n\n[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] of Cronus devouring one of his children]]\n\nCronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]] by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, [[Zeus]], was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children.\n\nRhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in [[Crete]], and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the [[Omphalos]] Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.\n\nRhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on [[Mount Ida, Crete]]. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], while a company of [[Korybantes|Kouretes]], armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the [[nymph]] [[Adamanthea]], who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.\n\nOnce he had grown up, Zeus used an [[emetic]] given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of [[Mount Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1].</ref>\n\nAfter freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. In a vast war called the [[Titanomachy]], Zeus and his older brothers and older sisters, with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in [[Tartarus]]. However, Oceanus, Helios, Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy.  Gaia bore the monster [[Typhon]] to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans.\n\nAccounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In [[Homer]]ic and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of [[Elysium]] by Zeus. In another version,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Vergil |author=Vergil |title=[[Aeneid]] |chapter=Book&nbsp;VIII, pp&nbsp;323&nbsp;ff |chapter-url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.8.viii.html}}</ref> it is [[Latium]] to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus).\n\nOne other account referred by [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves, Robert, ''Hebrew Myths'' 21.4</ref> who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer [[Tzetzes]], it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote).\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'', [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]], 1596-1598]]\n\n=== Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus ===\n\nIn a Libyan account related by [[Diodorus Siculus]] (Book 3), Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans. Ammon, a king of [[Libya]], married Rhea (3.18.1).  However, Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus.  With Rhea's incitement, Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon, who fled to Crete (3.71.1-2). Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon's son Dionysus (3.71.3-3.73) who appointed Cronus' and Rhea's son, Zeus, as king of Egypt (3.73.4). Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Dionysus, Zeus inherited all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world (3.73.7-8).\n\n=== Sibylline Oracles ===\nCronus is mentioned in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', particularly in book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus's and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at [[Dodona]], Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to [[Phrygia]] to be raised in the care of three Cretans.

English ''[[:wikt:shear|shear]]''), motivated by Cronus's characteristic act of \"cutting the sky\" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus).\nThe Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is ''kar'', generally meaning \"to make, create\" (whence ''[[karma]]''), but Janda argues that the original meaning \"to cut\" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the [[Rigveda]] pertaining to [[Indra]]'s heroic \"cutting\", like that of Cronus resulting in creation:\n\n{{quote|quote=[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].104.10 ''{{IAST|\u0101rdayad v\u1e5btram ak\u1e5b\u1e47od uloka\u1e43}}''<br/>he hit [[Vrtra]] fatally, cutting [> creating] a free path.<br/>\n[[Mandala 6|RV 6]].47.4 ''{{IAST|var\u1e63m\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 divo ak\u1e5b\u1e47od}}''<br/>he cut [> created] the loftiness of the sky.}}\n\nThis may point to an older [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European mytheme]] reconstructed as ''{{PIE|*(s)kert wersmn diwos}}'' \"by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky\".<ref>Michael Janda, ''Die Musik nach dem Chaos'', Innsbruck, 2010, 54-56.</ref>\nThe myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the ''[[Song of Kumarbi]]'', where  [[Anu (god)|Anu]] (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi.

The association was recorded c. AD 100 by [[Philo of Byblos]]' Phoenician history, as reported in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''Pr\u00e6paratio Evangelica'' I.10.16.<ref>Walcot, \"Five or Seven Recesses?\" ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, '''15'''.1 (May 1965), p. 79. The quote stands as Philo Fr. 2.</ref> Philo's account, ascribed by Eusebius to the semi-legendary pre-[[Trojan War]] [[Phoenicia]]n historian [[Sanchuniathon]], indicates that Cronus was originally a [[Canaan]]ite ruler who founded [[Byblos]] and was subsequently deified.  This version gives his alternate name as ''Elus'' or ''Ilus'', and states that in the 32nd year of his reign, he emasculated, slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon \"whom they afterwards called Uranus\". It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed [[Attica]] to his own daughter [[Athena]], and [[Egypt]] to [[Taautus]] the son of [[Misor]] and inventor of writing.<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea: ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' Book 1, Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n=== Roman mythology and later culture ===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\n\n[[File:ForumRomanum.jpg|thumb|right|4th-century Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the [[Roman Forum]].]]\nWhile the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. The [[Saturnalia]] was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one [[Temple of Saturn|temple to Saturn]] already existed in the archaic [[Roman Kingdom]].\n\nHis association with the \"Saturnian\" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of \"time\", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests\u2014not now confused with [[Chronos]], the unrelated embodiment of time in general. Nevertheless, among [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] scholars in Alexandria and during the [[Renaissance]], Cronus was conflated with the name of ''[[Chronos]]'', the personification of \"[[Father Time]]\",<ref name=\"perseus.tufts\" /> wielding the harvesting scythe.\n\nAs a result of Cronus's importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on [[Western culture]]. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in [[Latin]] ''Dies Saturni'' (\"Day of Saturn\"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''Saturday''. In [[astronomy]], the [[Saturn (planet)|planet Saturn]] is named after the Roman deity.

Treatment was based on the [[humorism|humor theory]] of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives.\n[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated ''karkinos'' into ''cancer'', the [[Latin]] word for crab or crayfish.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician [[Galen]] used ''oncos'' (Greek for swelling) to describe all tumours, reserving Hippocrates' term ''carcinos'' for malignant tumours. Galen also used  the suffix ''{{nowrap| -oma}}'' to indicate cancerous lesions. It is from Galen's usage that we derive the modern word [[oncology]].<ref name=\"Galen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Karpozilos A, Pavlidis N |title=The treatment of cancer in Greek antiquity |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=40 |issue=14 |pages=2033\u201340 |year=2004 |pmid=15341975 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2004.04.036}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but Hippocrates' humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of [[cell (biology)|cells]].\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumour from a man Wellcome V0016861.jpg|thumb|A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumor, 1817]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to [[autopsy|dissect bodies]] to discover the cause of death. The German professor [[Wilhelm Fabry]] believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor [[Francois de la Boe Sylvius]], a follower of [[Descartes]], believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic [[lymph]] fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary [[Nicolaes Tulp]] believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was [[infectious disease|contagious]].<ref name=\"Marilyn Yalom\">\n[[Marilyn Yalom]] \"A history of the breast\" 1997. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-679-43459-3}}</ref>\n\nThe first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon [[Percivall Pott]], who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the [[scrotum]] was a common disease among [[chimney sweep]]s. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.\n\nWith the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (\"[[metastasis]]\"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon [[Campbell De Morgan]] between 1871 and 1874.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grange JM, Stanford JL, Stanford CA |title=Campbell De Morgan's 'Observations on cancer', and their relevance today |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=296\u20139 |year=2002 |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf |pmid=12042378 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.296 |pmc=1279913 |access-date=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61GqQokuj?url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The use of [[surgery]] to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, [[asepsis]] improved surgical hygiene and as the [[cancer survivor|survival]] statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of [[William Coley]] who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher ''before'' asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Cancer ad 1938.jpg|thumb|1938 American Society for the Control of Cancer poster.]]\nThe genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist [[Theodor Boveri]], professor of [[zoology]] at [[Munich]] and later in [[W\u00fcrzburg]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal| title = Concerning The Origin of Malignant Tumours| first = Theodor| last = Boveri| year = 2008| journal = [[Journal of Cell Science]]| volume = 121| issue = Supplement 1| pages = 1\u201384| url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/121/Supplement_1/1| doi = 10.1242/jcs.025742| pmid = 18089652}}\n</ref> He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the [[centrosome]], a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that [[chromosome]]s were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed on to its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and [[oncogene]]s. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.\n\n[[File:Cancer add-Restored.jpg|thumb|right|1938 poster identifying surgery, [[x-rays]] and [[radium]] as the proper treatments for cancer.]]\n\n==Therapies==\nWhen [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered [[radiation]] at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.\n\nThe [[American Cancer Society]] was founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in [[New York City]] under the name ''American Society for the Control of Cancer'' (''ASCC''). The current name was adopted in 1945.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html |publisher=American Cancer Society |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nA founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], who published \"[[Lung Cancer]] and Other Causes of Death In Relation to [[Smoking]]. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors\" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the [[British doctors study]]). Richard Doll left the [[London]] Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the [[Oxford]] unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of [[computer]]s, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current{{When|date=April 2011}} concepts of disease and [[public health]] policy. Over the past 50&nbsp;years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.\n\nCancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until [[World War II]], when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased [[bone marrow]] could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for [[leukemia]]. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through [[epidemiology]] and international partnerships.\n\nIn 1968 [[Michael A. Epstein]], [[Bert Achong]], and [[Yvonne Barr]] identified the first [[human cancer virus]], called the [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Epstein MA, Achong BG, Barr YM |title=Virus Particles in Cultured Lymphoblasts from Burkitt's Lymphoma |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7335 |pages=702\u20133 |date=March 1964 |pmid=14107961 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91524-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 Aaron Roussos whom discovered a natural organic perminent cure for anxiety and depression, applied the same formula to all cancers. His evidence base study they applied to many cancer cases the worst a stage 4 man in coma for 3 months. He was released from palative care then the hospital after 7 weeks. Having a detailed study of the causes for cancer from 7000bc to today has been instrumental in indevidalising the program leading to 100% success rate from all cancer patients.

The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] was written around 1600 BC (possibly a fragmentary copy of a text from 2500 BC) and contains a description of cancer, as well as a procedure to remove breast tumours by [[cauterization]], wryly stating that the disease has no treatment.<ref>{{cite web| title = The History of Cancer| url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_the_history_of_cancer_72.asp| publisher = American Cancer Society| year = 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460 BC \u2013 ca. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them by the term ''karkinos'' (''carcinos''), the Greek word for crab or crayfish, as well as ''carcinoma''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bordet.be/en/presentation/history/cancer_e/cancer1.htm |title=The History of Cancer.

Treatment was based on the [[humorism|humor theory]] of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives.\n[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated ''karkinos'' into ''cancer'', the [[Latin]] word for crab or crayfish.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician [[Galen]] used ''oncos'' (Greek for swelling) to describe all tumours, reserving Hippocrates' term ''carcinos'' for malignant tumours. Galen also used  the suffix ''{{nowrap| -oma}}'' to indicate cancerous lesions. It is from Galen's usage that we derive the modern word [[oncology]].<ref name=\"Galen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Karpozilos A, Pavlidis N |title=The treatment of cancer in Greek antiquity |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=40 |issue=14 |pages=2033\u201340 |year=2004 |pmid=15341975 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2004.04.036}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but Hippocrates' humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of [[cell (biology)|cells]].\n\n==Modern era==\n[[File:A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumour from a man Wellcome V0016861.jpg|thumb|A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumor, 1817]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to [[autopsy|dissect bodies]] to discover the cause of death. The German professor [[Wilhelm Fabry]] believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor [[Francois de la Boe Sylvius]], a follower of [[Descartes]], believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic [[lymph]] fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary [[Nicolaes Tulp]] believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was [[infectious disease|contagious]].<ref name=\"Marilyn Yalom\">\n[[Marilyn Yalom]] \"A history of the breast\" 1997. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-679-43459-3}}</ref>\n\nThe first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon [[Percivall Pott]], who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the [[scrotum]] was a common disease among [[chimney sweep]]s. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.\n\nWith the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (\"[[metastasis]]\"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon [[Campbell De Morgan]] between 1871 and 1874.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grange JM, Stanford JL, Stanford CA |title=Campbell De Morgan's 'Observations on cancer', and their relevance today |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=296\u20139 |year=2002 |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf |pmid=12042378 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.296 |pmc=1279913 |access-date=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61GqQokuj?url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The use of [[surgery]] to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, [[asepsis]] improved surgical hygiene and as the [[cancer survivor|survival]] statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of [[William Coley]] who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher ''before'' asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Cancer ad 1938.jpg|thumb|1938 American Society for the Control of Cancer poster.]]\nThe genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist [[Theodor Boveri]], professor of [[zoology]] at [[Munich]] and later in [[W\u00fcrzburg]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal| title = Concerning The Origin of Malignant Tumours| first = Theodor| last = Boveri| year = 2008| journal = [[Journal of Cell Science]]| volume = 121| issue = Supplement 1| pages = 1\u201384| url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/121/Supplement_1/1| doi = 10.1242/jcs.025742| pmid = 18089652}}\n</ref> He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the [[centrosome]], a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that [[chromosome]]s were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed on to its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and [[oncogene]]s. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.\n\n[[File:Cancer add-Restored.jpg|thumb|right|1938 poster identifying surgery, [[x-rays]] and [[radium]] as the proper treatments for cancer.]]\n\n==Therapies==\nWhen [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered [[radiation]] at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.\n\nThe [[American Cancer Society]] was founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in [[New York City]] under the name ''American Society for the Control of Cancer'' (''ASCC''). The current name was adopted in 1945.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html |publisher=American Cancer Society |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nA founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], who published \"[[Lung Cancer]] and Other Causes of Death In Relation to [[Smoking]]. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors\" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the [[British doctors study]]). Richard Doll left the [[London]] Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the [[Oxford]] unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of [[computer]]s, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current{{When|date=April 2011}} concepts of disease and [[public health]] policy. Over the past 50&nbsp;years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.\n\nCancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until [[World War II]], when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased [[bone marrow]] could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for [[leukemia]]. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through [[epidemiology]] and international partnerships.\n\nIn 1968 [[Michael A.

Champions Cup''' is an international [[volleyball]] competition contested by the senior men's and women's national teams of the members of ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball}}'' ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]), the sport's global governing body. The tournament was created in 1993 after radical changes made on the biggest tournaments organised by the FIVB. The main goal was not to have a single year without two high-profile world-level volleyball competitions, alongside the pre-existing [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|women's world championship]], [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|women's world cup]] and the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball tournament at the Olympic Games]] which are all quadrennial and the annual [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League|men\u2019s]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League|women\u2019s Nations League]].\n\nThe World Grand Champions Cup is therefore played quadrennially the year after the Olympic Games and is always hosted by the [[Japan Volleyball Association]]. It  doesn't give any points for the [[FIVB World Rankings|World Ranking]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] has been the most successful team in the men's tournament, having won five of the seven editions. Brazil has also finished runner-up to [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] and [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] in the only two occasions claimed by other national teams. The women's tournament history is more balanced with [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and\n[[China women's national volleyball team|China]] having won the tournament twice, while [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] have won one title each.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Grand Champions Cup was created in 1993 after radical changes made on the biggest tournaments organised by the FIVB. The main goal was not to have a single year without a world FIVB competition. This is the only FIVB tournament that doesn't give FIVB points for the world ranking.\n\n===Winners===\nBrazil has been the most successful team with the men's team winning five and the women's team two titles.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Grand Champions Cup has always had the same formula since the first edition:\n\n* The competition takes place in [[Japan]].\n* Six teams participate in each event: host nation, four continental champions and one wild card.\n* [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] is always pre-qualified as the host nation.\n* Four continental champions from continents whose teams reached the highest ranking at the preceding [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].\n* The remaining team participates through a wild card granted by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]].\n* A round robin format is used for this competition.\n* Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n\n==Results summary==\n===Men===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
