Most [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] stories agree he was an older half-brother of [[Paikea]] and 69 other sons, while traditions recorded from the [[Cook Islands]] sometimes state he was [[Uenuku#Other characters|Uanuku Rakeiora]]'s only son.\n\nIn the oral traditions of the Cook Islands, Ruatapu travels around central Polynesia; from the [[Society Islands]], to the Cook Islands, and lastly to [[Tonga]] before coming back to the Cook Islands to live out the rest of his days and eventually die at [[Aitutaki]]. Most traditions record him as a prominent ancestor, gaining three wives between the last two groups of islands.\n\n==Cook Island traditions==\nThe stories relating to Ruatapu's life are fairly consistent with each other.

For this he crafted the canoe ''Te Kareroaitai'' out of a [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tamanu tree]] before setting out to the ocean upon reaching adulthood. Eight or nine days later, he arrived at [[Rarotonga#Subdivisions|Avarua]] Harbour at [[Rarotonga]] and met local Chief Potikitaua of Avananui village who told him the island's ariki was Chief Tangiia. He decided to settle here, and found a wife out of Uanukukaiatia,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Uanukutapu, with whom he had a son with named Tamaiva.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/>\n\nFour years later, Ruatapu left Rarotonga alone in search of a new island, leaving Tamaiva to grow up and become the island's ariki.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/> After many days and nights at sea, Ruatapu arrived at [[Tongatapu]] where the first person he met was Tapotuki Tonga, who informed him that the island's ariki was Chief Kaukura. Ruatapu stayed with Tapotuki Tonga, growing fond of her, and ended up having another son with her named Moenau.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nWhile the child was still young, Ruatapu decided to leave again, but first instructing Tapotuki Tonga's father Rangiura to take Moenau back to Rarotonga to be with Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva, to share share chiefly authority.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/> Rangiura being another noted canoe voyager, constructed a new canoe for this voyage and named it ''Pouara''. On this trip, the canoe capsized on a reef. The spot where this happened was called ''Vaenga'', the place where they landed is today called ''Pouara'' after the canoe. A man named Anga brought them to Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva. Upon the two families meeting, Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva were jealous of Moenau and did not wish to take him in. They instructed that he should be taken to the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru islands]] ([[Atiu]], [[Mauke|Ma'uke]], and [[Mitiaro]]) where he could become ariki. After five days of rest and repairing the canoe ''Pouara'', Rangiura and Moenau set out to Ngaputoru. On this voyage they struck bad weather and Rangiura was killed on the reef of Ma'uke. Moenau survived and was taken in by the local people.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nOnce he had grown into a strong young man, Moenau married a native Ma'uke woman named Te Kaumarokura,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Te Raumarokura, with whom he had a son named Te Aukura (sometimes ''-arikiki Mauketau'' is added, meaning 'Ariki of Mauketau').<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/> Due to Moenau's greed in taking all the fishermans' catchments for himself, the people of Ma\u2018uke devised a plan to kill him. Two warriors named Taratekui and Taratekurapo were chosen to kill Moenau using a fine cord made out of coconut-fibre (''kaa natipui''). After luring him out of his house, they caught him by the testicles with the cord and overpowered him, killing him with spears before throwing the body into a cave in the [[Makatea (district)|Makatea]]. While the people of Ma'uke were joyed that he was gone, Te Kaumarokura grieved over her loss, and feared she would be killed along with their now four-year-old son Te Aukura. Instead, Taratekui and Taratekurapo pitied them, and would bring fish to them every week.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Return to the Cook Islands===\nAll this time, Ruatapu had been on Tongatapu waiting for Rangiura to return with news of a safe arrival to Rarotonga. Due to the amount of time that had passed, he feared the worst, and tracked down his eldest son Tamaiva to ask where Moenau and Rangiura were. Tamaiva, now an adult, told Ruatapu that he had indeed met Moenau long ago as a child, but sent him to Ngaputoru. This angered Ruatapu, who at once set out for Ma'uke Island where he found a group of children playing by the beach. One child was his grandson, Te Aukura, who told him that Moenau had been killed. Te Aukura brought Ruatapu to his mother Te Kaumarokura, who was with Taratekui and Taratekurapo. She told Ruatapu they were her relatives, not her husbands, and that they were looking after her and the child.\n\nAfter Ruatapu had fallen asleep in their house, the warriors confessed to Te Kaumarokura that they feared him - surely he must be a great ariki, or even an [[atua]], and begged her to not tell him what they did to his son, to which she agreed, so he could not avenge his son's death. The next morning, Ruatapu enquired about his son's death and whether he could take the child with him. Te Kaumarokura told him a half-truth; Moenau had 'fallen' into a cave at Makatea, and had not been slain. Te Aukura did not wish to go with him, which Ruatapu respected, saying that if he left the island, Moenau's name and lineage would be forgotten there.\n\nThree days after leaving the island, Ruatapu finally met a fisherman who told him the truth of Moenau's death, as every other person on the island had been afraid of him. Ruatapu, though, said it was too late to turn around and kill them, for he had already left in peace.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> Alternatively, Te Aukura had told him on their first meeting what had happened to Moenau, and so he killed a large number of the island's inhabitants by rolling the logs of coconut trees atop of them from a higher place.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/>\n\nThe next evening he arrived at Atiu Island and went ashore, meeting the ariki Chief Renga, who asked him to help improve a natural passage through a reef called Taunganui, and make it fit for canoes. Ruatapu agreed, but had to cut his time on Atiu short when he found there wasn't enough food for everybody on the island. Chief Renga gave him food and gifts for his next voyage; some coconuts, a [[Kuhl's lorikeet|kura]] bird, a moo bird, and the roots of the [[Gardenia taitensis|tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] which grows sweet-smelling flowers.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> He also renamed his then-canoe from ''Te Kareroakite Enuamanu'', to ''Tueumoana''.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/>\n[[File:Starr 070221-4646 Gardenia sp..jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|[[Gardenia taitensis|Tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] at the [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] Aquatic Center. A specific tree that Ruatapu planted, ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'', is said to still be the largest of its species in the Cook Islands.]]\nAfter three days of travel, Ruatapu found two large uninhabited islands sharing a lagoon, collectively naming the area [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuenua]] because of the large groups of [[Red-billed tropicbird|tavake]] that were nesting there. He spent four days resting on the island, freeing the birds he was given, planting some of the tiar\u00e9 maori roots and the coconut to grow a tree which he named ''Te Tuia Rongo'',<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/> or ''Tuiorongo'', and naming the planted tiar\u00e9 maori roots ''(Te) Aravaine''.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Settling at Aitutaki===\nNext, traveling west-north-west, he arrived at a [[Aitutaki#Minor islands of Aitutaki|lagoon with a number of small islands]] and one large island, where he passed through a small reef passage named Kopuaonu and stayed on Oaka Island, at the shingle spit called ''Te Okaokaanga-i-te niu-a Ruatapu''. The next morning he found and ate a large ''[[Hermit crab|unga]]'' slightly further inland, naming the spot ''Kaiunga''. Next he planted the last of his tiar\u00e9 maori root, naming it ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'' after his second wife Tapotuki Tonga,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or sometimes known as ''Te tiar\u00e9 a Ruatapu''. He then moved onto the mainland of this lagoon, naming the place where he landed ''Maitai'', and moving slightly further inland he named ''Paengamanuiri'' after erecting an altar for the worship of [[atua|'evil' spirits]], where the appellation of ''Vai-tiar\u00e9'' made out of tiar\u00e9 flowers may still be seen today,<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213\"/> and then moving even further in he built his marae called ''Aumatangi''. This was all very near to a small settlement called Vaitupa, on the island of [[Aitutaki|Ututakienuao Ru]], today called Aitutaki. The ariki was Chief Taruia.\n\nFinally he settled among the people of Vaitupa, taking Tutunoa as his wife, by whom he had four children. Two boys; Kirikava and Te Urutupui, a girl named Tongirau, and a boy named Touketa. When Kirikava had grown old enough, he asked his father to teach him fishing practices. So Ruatapu gathered the bark of an [[Hibiscus|au tree]] and treated it with ''kiriau'' - a process of leaving it in the sea for a few days before bringing it to land, to keep it from rotting for about a year. He called the people of Vaitupa to help make the nets, as they had never had nets on the island before. Together they completed a small net called a ''tuturua'', which Ruatapu gave to his son Te Urutupui. After completing a bigger net for Kirikava, the villagers were divided into two groups, one for each net.\n\nBoth nets caught great catches of fish each. Kirikava divided the big fish (and two turtles) amongst the men in his party, but forgetting to give some to his father, while Te Urutupui gave Ruatapu the finest fish of his catchment of small fish. By showing gratitude to his father in this action, he ensured his net would always catch lots of fish. The next time the nets were left and pulled out, the brothers did the same as before, Kirikava's actions only making Ruatapu angry for not following [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] traditions. Kirikava replied that because Ruatapu was an ariki, so too must he, and that since he was the master of his own net, he could decide what to do with it. This being the last straw, Ruatapu banished Kirikava from his house and disowned him, stating he would not be an ariki for very long. At this Kirikava left the home, and settled his own marae called Aputu and married Te Nonoioiva, with whom he had a son named Maevarangi. Te Urutupui also took Vainepuarangi as his own wife, both wives were brought to the island by one Ru. Tongirau married a man named Te Araroa, and had a child named Te Aunuio-ota, who Ruatapu would train in wrestling and spear-fighting.\n\nRuatapu grew older, and instructed Te Urutupui to take his wife to Manuenua where he could live as ariki. He gave them the canoe Tueumoana, and it took three days for them to arrive at the smaller island where Ruatapu had earlier planted the flowers and coconuts. They moved over to the bigger island and named it Te Auo Tepui.\n\nTwo years later, Rongovei arrived to Manuenua in his canoe, the ''Tanemaitai'', and became very good friends with Te Urutupui, who told him to go back to the island of his father and bring back a wife and rule as ariki. This he did, landing at a passage called Ruaikakau near the settlement of Reureutematao Te Erui, where he took Tiapara and Punanga-atua as his wives before visiting Ruatapu to deliver news of his son. They returned to Manuenua and lived on the smaller island.\n\n===Becoming Ariki===\nOne day, Ruatapu went up to the highest point of [[Aitutaki]] where he rested under an utu tree, out of anger towards his son Kirikava, in search of a new home. He rested under this tree at a spot which he called ''Teutumarama'', before venturing further. Kirikava ran to catch up with him upon finding out he was gone, and begged Ruatapu not to leave. Ruatapu told him to leave, threatening to kill him with his spear and axe if he did not. Kirikava replied: \u201cAll right, my father, if it pleases you to kill your son, do so. I won\u2019t try to stop you.\u201d to which Ruatapu broke down and wept. He asked him to sit down so they could talk to each other, and they arranged two lines of black stones as they resolved their differences, calling the spot ''Te Ruatoke''. Ruatapu instructed him to return home to Vaitupa where his brother and sister still lived, promising not to forget them if he became the ariki. This Kirikava did and Ruatapu continued on to a settlement called Anainga, where he found the people bringing food to the ariki, Chief Taruia. Ruatapu decided to take Taruia's place as ariki, and created a small model canoe called a kopae out of coconut leaves. He set it in the lagoon where one of Taruia's warriors caught it, and ran to show him, amazed and having never seen anything like it. Taruia said this was an ''akairo'' (sign) that another ariki was present on the island and that his people should find this ariki somewhere at a place called Te Upokoenua, where indeed Ruatapu was found sitting in the sand, and was brought back to Taruia, who insisted Ruatapu stay with him and accept food.\n\nSome days later Ruatapu suggested they dam a small creek named Vaireirei from running into the ocean, wasting fresh water. This was a contest of skill, which Ruatapu completed under two days, successfully damming the creek. A second challenge which Ruatapu suggested, was to see who could build a canoe the fastest before traveling to other islands. Taruia asked what purpose there would be in traveling, as all islands were about the same anyway, and no more exciting than Aitutaki. At this Ruatapu laughed, saying there were many bigger islands, and some with beautiful women of much lighter complexion - some almost white - and with a brighter hair tone, all of this sounded much better to Taruia than what his island already offered. Once again, Ruatapu proved to be the more skilled ariki, completing his canoe first and calling it ''Te Atua-apaipai''.\n\nRuatapu brought the canoe down to the lagoon, and said he'd venture out in the morning. Taruia asked him not to go as his own canoe was almost finished, and they could go together. Ruatapu wouldn't agree to this at first, saying he would go first and call back out to Taruia from Rarotonga. Afterwards, he said he would wait until the day after to give Taruia time to finish the canoe.\n\nOn the day they were ready, Ruatapu set out his canoe two hours ahead of Taruia, and intentionally capsized it knowing Taruia would find him in the water. This happened near a small island named Mainainara, and the exact spot where it happened was named ''Raukuruvaka''. It was not long before Taruia found him and Ruatapu pleaded for his help. Taruia laughed at him, telling him that he instead would wait in Rarotonga and call back out to Ruatapu, just as he said he would to Taruia. He laughed again before sailing away out of sight. Ruatapu quickly righted his canoe and headed back for Aitutaki, calling all the [[Mataiapo|mataipo]] together and telling the people that he did not know whether Taruia was alive. The people agreed that Ruatapu should become Aitutaki's new ariki.\n\nTaruia, having safely landed in Rarotonga, slowly began to realise what Ruatapu had done, and feared he had stolen the title of ariki from him. He gathered some strong men from amongst his new friends at Rarotonga and sailed back to reclaim his position. The people Aitutaki saw Taruia's war party heading back, and Ruatapu decided to engage them in a fight, so they battled at the Ruaikakau passage, in the water. Taruia and his people withdrew and traveled for three weeks to another island, [[Penrhyn atoll|M\u0101ngarongaro]], where Taruia's descendants still live today.\n\nRuatapu, now an old man with death closing in on him, sent for his son Kirikava to come live with him in the chief's house - Paepaeoronga - and become the new ariki upon his death. Soon, news came from Ruatapu's home village Taputapuatea that a new warrior named Tuotakura had become known amongst many islands as talented in martial arts skills such as wrestling and spear-fighting. He lived on the island of [[Tahiti]]. Since Kirikava had disobeyed his father when he was younger, he could not take on this warrior. However after much convincing, Ruatapu allowed for his people to build Kirikava a canoe to take him to Tahiti.\n\nIn a few days after arriving at Tahiti, he had watched other young warriors duel with Tuotakura, and knew he would be no match. Indeed, he proved to be no match in a contest of wrestling, and went home ashamed. This defeat, which Ruatapu could not correct himself as he was too old, depressed him so much that it sent him into bad health, and before long he had passed away, making Kirikava the new ariki of Aitutaki.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori traditions==\n[[File:Comb, Maori people, whalebone, collected during James Cook's second circumnavigation 1772-75 by Anders Sparrman - Etnografiska museet - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC00816.JPG|thumb|right|350x350px|A M\u0101ori whalebone comb at Etnografiska museet, collected by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] - so often, the denial of a sacred comb is the catalyst for Ruatapu's revenge.]]\nIn the M\u0101ori traditions of Ruatapu's life, he is always a son of Chief Uenuku, ariki of [[Hawaiki]], and is belittled by him for being his only son born of a slave wife, and therefore being unable to use a sacred comb in his hair. With the exception of [[Paikea]], Ruatapu kills Hawaiki's nobility aboard a canoe in every telling. The story is particularly well-known to tribes that originated in the [[Gisborne District]] such as [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]], [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]], and [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]], and especially Ng\u0101ti Porou's [[hap\u016b]] Ng\u0101ti Konohi.\n\nIn one telling of the legend, Ruatapu had been belittled by Uenuku for using the sacred comb of his elder brother, [[Paikea|Kahutiaterangi]]. As revenge, Ruatapu enticed most of Uenuku's children into his canoe, sailed them to the ocean, and then sank it in an event called ''Te Huripureiata''. Kahutiaterangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as Paikea. Meanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants. Paikea fled to high ground and was saved through the intervention of the goddess [[Moakuramanu]]. One version of the myth holds that Ruatapu drowned in the flood and that his bowels became the first jellyfish.<ref name=\"Craig1989\">{{cite book|author=R.D.

Ruatapu then went away and built his own large canoe that could hold 140 people. Once finished he announced that he would set off in it, and then killed everyone aboard with a spear, save for Paikea, who took to the ocean and was saved by the gods.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/ngai-tahu/page-1|title=Early history [of Ng\u0101i Tahu]|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn yet another telling says that Chief Uenuku made a canoe for the nobility and was preparing the hair of all 70 of his noble children for their first sail inside of it. Uenuku himself, combed, oiled, and tied the hair of every last one of them, except Ruatapu. When Ruatapu asked why his father had not treated his hair, Uenuku told him he could not because he was the only son of a slave woman, and his hair was not tapu like his brothers'. This put Ruatapu to shame, and so he refused to eat dinner that night, instead going down to the canoe and putting a hole in its bottom, before filling it with wood chips and hiding the canoe's bailer. In the morning when they launched the canoe, Ruatapu hid the hole with his heel. When they were far out at sea he released the hole and removed the chips. The water rushed in, and nobody could find the bailer as Ruatapu had hidden it on shore. Everybody drowned, except Paikea, who was saved through his mother's ancestor [[Tangaroa]] who summoned the whale. Ruatapu's last attempt at killing Paikea was to use an incantation to hurl waves at him. This backfired as Paikea was too far away now, and the waves just rolled back onto Ruatapu thus drowning him.<ref name=\"TeAo\">{{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao40TeA/c5.html|title=The Story of Paikea and Ruatapu|publisher=Te Puna M\u0101tauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ng\u0101ti Porou tradition===\nIn a tradition of Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutiaterangi ahead of him in status. Ruatapu lured Kahutiaterangi and a large number of young men of high birth into his canoe, and took them out to sea where he drowned them.  He called on the gods to destroy his enemies and threatened to return as the great waves of early summer,<ref name=\"Reedy1997\">{{cite book|author=Reedy, Anaru|date=1997|title=Ng\u0101 K\u014drero a Pita K\u0101piti: The Teachings of Pita K\u0101piti|location=Christchurch|publisher=Canterbury University Press|pp=83-85)}}</ref> shouting out to Kahutiaterangi that he would return to fight him: \"The great waves of the eighth month, they are me!

For this he crafted the canoe ''Te Kareroaitai'' out of a [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tamanu tree]] before setting out to the ocean upon reaching adulthood. Eight or nine days later, he arrived at [[Rarotonga#Subdivisions|Avarua]] Harbour at [[Rarotonga|Rarotonga]] and met local Chief Potikitaua of Avananui village who told him the island's ariki was Chief Tangiia. He decided to settle here, and found a wife out of Uanukukaiatia,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Uanukutapu, with whom he had a son with named Tamaiva.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nFour years later, Ruatapu left Rarotonga alone in search of a new island, leaving Tamaiva to grow up and become the island's ariki.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> After many days and nights at sea, Ruatapu arrived at [[Tongatapu|Tongatapu]] where the first person he met was Tapotuki Tonga, who informed him that the island's ariki was Chief Kaukura. Ruatapu stayed with Tapotuki Tonga, growing fond of her, and ended up having another son with her named Moenau.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nWhile the child was still young, Ruatapu decided to leave again, but first instructing Tapotuki Tonga's father Rangiura to take Moenau back to Rarotonga to be with Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva, to share share chiefly authority.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Rangiura being another noted canoe voyager, constructed a new canoe for this voyage and named it ''Pouara''. On this trip, the canoe capsized on a reef. The spot where this happened was called ''Vaenga'', the place where they landed is today called ''Pouara'' after the canoe. A man named Anga brought them to Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva. Upon the two families meeting, Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva were jealous of Moenau and did not wish to take him in. They instructed that he should be taken to the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru islands]] ([[Atiu]], [[Mauke|Ma'uke]], and [[Mitiaro]]) where he could become ariki. After five days of rest and repairing the canoe ''Pouara'', Rangiura and Moenau set out to Ngaputoru. On this voyage they struck bad weather and Rangiura was killed on the reef of Ma'uke. Moenau survived and was taken in by the local people.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nOnce he had grown into a strong young man, Moenau married a native Ma'uke woman named Te Kaumarokura,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Te Raumarokura, with whom he had a son named Te Aukura (sometimes ''-arikiki Mauketau'' is added, meaning 'Ariki of Mauketau').<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Due to Moenau's greed in taking all the fishermans' catchments for himself, the people of Ma\u2018uke devised a plan to kill him. Two warriors named Taratekui and Taratekurapo were chosen to kill Moenau using a fine cord made out of coconut-fibre (''kaa natipui''). After luring him out of his house, they caught him by the testicles with the cord and overpowered him, killing him with spears before throwing the body into a cave in the [[Makatea (district)|Makatea]]. While the people of Ma'uke were joyed that he was gone, Te Kaumarokura grieved over her loss, and feared she would be killed along with their now four year old son Te Aukura. Instead, Taratekui and Taratekurapo pitied them, and would bring fish to them every week.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Return to the Cook Islands===\nAll this time, Ruatapu had been on Tongatapu waiting for Rangiura to return with news of a safe arrival to Rarotonga. Due to the amount of time that had passed, he feared the worst, and tracked down his eldest son Tamaiva to ask where Moenau and Rangiura were. Tamaiva, now an adult, told Ruatapu that he had indeed met Moenau long ago as a child, but sent him to Ngaputoru. This angered Ruatapu, who at once set out for Ma'uke Island where he found a group of children playing by the beach. One child was his grandson, Te Aukura, who told him that Moenau had been killed. Te Aukura brought Ruatapu to his mother Te Kaumarokura, who was with Taratekui and Taratekurapo. She told Ruatapu they were her relatives, not her husbands, and that they were looking after her and the child.\n\nAfter Ruatapu had fallen asleep in their house, the warriors confessed to Te Kaumarokura that they feared him - surely he must be a great ariki, or even an [[atua]], and begged her to not tell him what they did to his son, to which she agreed, so he could not avenge his son's death. The next morning, Ruatapu enquired about his son's death and whether he could take the child with him. Te Kaumarokura told him a half-truth; Moenau had 'fallen' into a cave at Makatea, and had not been slain. Te Aukura did not wish to go with him, which Ruatapu respected, saying that if he left the island, Moenau's name and lineage would be forgotten there.\n\nThree days after leaving the island, Ruatapu finally met a fisherman who told him the truth of Moenau's death, as every other person on the island had been afraid of him. Ruatapu, though, said it was too late to turn around and kill them, for he had already left in peace.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> Alternatively, Te Aukura had told him on their first meeting what had happened to Moenau, and so he killed a large number of the island's inhabitants by rolling the logs of coconut trees atop of them from a higher place.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nThe next evening he arrived at Atiu Island and went ashore, meeting the ariki Chief Renga, who asked him to help improve a natural passage through a reef called Taunganui, and make it fit for canoes. Ruatapu agreed, but had to cut his time on Atiu short when he found there wasn't enough food for everybody on the island. Chief Renga gave him food and gifts for his next voyage; some coconuts, a [[Kuhl's lorikeet|kura]] bird, a moo bird, and the roots of the [[Gardenia taitensis|tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] which grows sweet-smelling flowers.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> He also renamed his then-canoe from ''Te Kareroakite Enuamanu'', to ''Tueumoana''.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n[[File:Starr 070221-4646 Gardenia sp..jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|[[Gardenia taitensis|Tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] at the [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] Aquatic Center. A specific tree that Ruatapu planted, ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'', is said to still be the largest of its species in the Cook Islands.]]\nAfter three days of travel, Ruatapu found two large uninhabited islands sharing a lagoon, collectively naming the area [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuenua]] because of the large groups of [[Red-billed tropicbird|tavake]] that were nesting there. He spent four days resting on the island, freeing the birds he was given, planting some of the tiar\u00e9 maori roots and the coconut to grow a tree which he named ''Te Tuia Rongo'',<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> or ''Tuiorongo'', and naming the planted tiar\u00e9 maori roots ''(Te) Aravaine''.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Settling at Aitutaki===\nNext, traveling west-north-west, he arrived at a [[Aitutaki#Minor islands of Aitutaki|lagoon with a number of small islands]] and one large island, where he passed through a small reef passage named Kopuaonu and stayed on Oaka Island, at the shingle spit called ''Te Okaokaanga-i-te niu-a Ruatapu''. The next morning he found and ate a large ''[[Hermit crab|unga]]'' slightly further inland, naming the spot ''Kaiunga''. Next he planted the last of his tiar\u00e9 maori root, naming it ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'' after his second wife Tapotuki Tonga,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or sometimes known as ''Te tiar\u00e9 a Ruatapu''. He then moved onto the mainland of this lagoon, naming the place where he landed ''Maitai'', and moving slightly further inland he named ''Paengamanuiri'' after erecting an altar for the worship of [[atua|'evil' spirits]], where the appellation of ''Vai-tiar\u00e9'' made out of tiar\u00e9 flowers may still be seen today,<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> and then moving even further in he built his marae called ''Aumatangi''. This was all very near to a small settlement called Vaitupa, on the island of [[Aitutaki|Ututakienuao Ru]], today called Aitutaki. The ariki was Chief Taruia.\n\nFinally he settled among the people of Vaitupa, taking Tutunoa as his wife, by whom he had four children. Two boys; Kirikava and Te Urutupui, a girl named Tongirau, and a boy named Touketa. When Kirikava had grown old enough, he asked his father to teach him fishing practices. So Ruatapu gathered the bark of an [[Hibiscus|au tree]] and treated it with ''kiriau'' - a process of leaving it in the sea for a few days before bringing it to land, to keep it from rotting for about a year. He called the people of Vaitupa to help make the nets, as they had never had nets on the island before. Together they completed a small net called a ''tuturua'', which Ruatapu gave to his son Te Urutupui. After completing a bigger net for Kirikava, the villagers were divided into two groups, one for each net.\n\nBoth nets caught great catches of fish each. Kirikava divided the big fish (and two turtles) amongst the men in his party, but forgetting to give some to his father, while Te Urutupui gave Ruatapu the finest fish of his catchment of small fish. By showing gratitude to his father in this action, he ensured his net would always catch lots of fish. The next time the nets were left and pulled out, the brothers did the same as before, Kirikava's actions only making Ruatapu angry for not following [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] traditions. Kirikava replied that because Ruatapu was an ariki, so too must he, and that since he was the master of his own net, he could decide what to do with it. This being the last straw, Ruatapu banished Kirikava from his house and disowned him, stating he would not be an ariki for very long. At this Kirikava left the home, and settled his own marae called Aputu and married Te Nonoioiva, with whom he had a son named Maevarangi. Te Urutupui also took Vainepuarangi as his own wife, both wives were brought to the island by one Ru. Tongirau married a man named Te Araroa, and had a child named Te Aunuio-ota, who Ruatapu would train in wrestling and spear-fighting.\n\nRuatapu grew older, and instructed Te Urutupui to take his wife to Manuenua where he could live as ariki. He gave them the canoe Tueumoana, and it took three days for them to arrive at the smaller island where Ruatapu had earlier planted the flowers and coconuts. They moved over to the bigger island and named it Te Auo Tepui.\n\nTwo years later, Rongovei arrived to Manuenua in his canoe, the ''Tanemaitai'', and became very good friends with Te Urutupui, who told him to go back to the island of his father and bring back a wife and rule as ariki. This he did, landing at a passage called Ruaikakau near the settlement of Reureutematao Te Erui, where he took Tiapara and Punanga-atua as his wives before visiting Ruatapu to deliver news of his son. They returned back to Manuenua and lived on the smaller island.\n\n===Becoming Ariki===\nOne day, Ruatapu went up to the highest point of [[Aitutaki]] where he rested under an utu tree, out of anger towards his son Kirikava, in search of a new home. He rested under this tree at a spot which he called ''Teutumarama'', before venturing further. Kirikava ran to catch up with him upon finding out he was gone, and begged Ruatapu not to leave. Ruatapu told him to leave, threatening to kill him with his spear and axe if he did not. Kirikava replied: \u201cAll right, my father, if it pleases you to kill your son, do so. I won\u2019t try to stop you.\u201d to which Ruatapu broke down and wept. He asked him to sit down so they could talk to each other, and they arranged two lines of black stones as they resolved their differences, calling the spot ''Te Ruatoke''. Ruatapu instructed him to return home to Vaitupa where his brother and sister still lived, promising not to forget them if he became the ariki. This Kirikava did and Ruatapu continued on to a settlement called Anainga, where he found the people bringing food to the ariki, Chief Taruia. Ruatapu decided to take Taruia's place as ariki, and created a small model canoe called a kopae out of coconut leaves. He set it in the lagoon where one of Taruia's warriors caught it, and ran to show him, amazed and having never seen anything like it. Taruia said this was an ''akairo'' (sign) that another ariki was present on the island and that his people should find this ariki somewhere at a place called Te Upokoenua, where indeed Ruatapu was found sitting in the sand, and was brought back to Taruia, who insisted Ruatapu stay with him and accept food.\n\nSome days later Ruatapu suggested they dam a small creek named Vaireirei from running into the ocean, wasting fresh water. This was a contest of skill, which Ruatapu completed under two days, successfully damming the creek. A second challenge which Ruatapu suggested, was to see who could build a canoe the fastest before traveling to other islands. Taruia asked what purpose there would be in traveling, as all islands were about the same anyway, and no more exciting than Aitutaki. At this Ruatapu laughed, saying there were many bigger islands, and some with beautiful women of much lighter complexion - some almost white - and with a brighter hair tone, all of this sounded much better to Taruia than what his island already offered. Once again, Ruatapu proved to be the more skilled ariki, completing his canoe first and calling it ''Te Atua-apaipai''.\n\nRuatapu brought the canoe down to the lagoon, and said he'd venture out in the morning. Taruia asked him not to go as his own canoe was almost finished, and they could go together. Ruatapu wouldn't agree to this at first, saying he would go first and call back out to Taruia from Rarotonga. Afterwards, he said he would wait until the day after to give Taruia time to finish the canoe.\n\nOn the day they were ready, Ruatapu set out his canoe two hours ahead of Taruia, and intentionally capsized it knowing Taruia would find him in the water. This happened near a small island named Mainainara, and the exact spot where it happened was named ''Raukuruvaka''. It was not long before Taruia found him and Ruatapu pleaded for his help. Taruia laughed at him, telling him that he instead would wait in Rarotonga and call back out to Ruatapu, just as he said he would to Taruia. He laughed again before sailing away out of sight. Ruatapu quickly righted his canoe and headed back for Aitutaki, calling all the [[Mataiapo|mataipo]] together and telling the people that he did not know whether Taruia was alive. The people agreed that Ruatapu should become Aitutaki's new ariki.\n\nTaruia, having safely landed in Rarotonga, slowly began to realise what Ruatapu had done, and feared he had stolen the title of ariki from him. He gathered some strong men from amongst his new friends at Rarotonga and sailed back to reclaim his position. The people Aitutaki saw Taruia's war party heading back, and Ruatapu decided to engage them in a fight, so they battled at the Ruaikakau passage, in the water. Taruia and his people withdrew and traveled for three weeks to another island, [[Penrhyn atoll|M\u0101ngarongaro]], where Taruia's descendants still live today.\n\nRuatapu, now an old man with death closing in on him, sent for his son Kirikava to come live with him in the chief's house - Paepaeoronga - and become the new ariki upon his death. Soon, news came from Ruatapu's home village Taputapuatea that a new warrior named Tuotakura had become known amongst many islands as talented in martial arts skills such as wrestling and spear-fighting. He lived on the island of [[Tahiti]]. Since Kirikava had disobeyed his father when he was younger, he could not take on this warrior. However after much convincing, Ruatapu allowed for his people to build Kirikava a canoe to take him to Tahiti.\n\nIn a few days after arriving at Tahiti, he had watched other young warriors duel with Tuotakura, and knew he would be no match. Indeed, he proved to be no match in a contest of wrestling, and went home ashamed. This defeat, which Ruatapu could not correct himself as he was too old, depressed him so much that it sent him into bad health, and before long he had passed away, making Kirikava the new ariki of Aitutaki.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori traditions==\n[[File:Comb, Maori people, whalebone, collected during James Cook's second circumnavigation 1772-75 by Anders Sparrman - Etnografiska museet - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC00816.JPG|thumb|right|350x350px|A M\u0101ori whalebone comb at Etnografiska museet, collected by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] - so often, the denial of a sacred comb is the catalyst for Ruatapu's revenge.]]\nIn the M\u0101ori traditions of Ruatapu's life, he is always a son of Chief Uenuku, ariki of [[Hawaiki]], and is belittled by him for being his only son born of a slave wife, and therefore being unable to use a sacred comb in his hair. With the exception of [[Paikea]], Ruatapu kills Hawaiki's nobility aboard a canoe in every telling. The story is particularly well-known to tribes that originated in the [[Gisborne District]] such as [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]], [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]], and [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]], and especially Ng\u0101ti Porou's [[hap\u016b]] Ng\u0101ti Konohi.\n\nIn one telling of the legend, Ruatapu had been belittled by Uenuku for using the sacred comb of his elder brother, [[Paikea|Kahutiaterangi]]. As revenge, Ruatapu enticed most of Uenuku's children into his canoe, sailed them to the ocean, and then sank it in an event called ''Te Huripureiata''. Kahutiaterangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as Paikea. Meanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants. Paikea fled to high ground and was saved through the intervention of the goddess [[Moakuramanu]]. One version of the myth holds that Ruatapu drowned in the flood and that his bowels became the first jellyfish.<ref name=\"Craig1989\">{{cite book|author=R.D.

Ruatapu then went away and built his own large canoe that could hold 140 people. Once finished he announced that he would set off in it, and then killed everyone aboard with a spear, save for Paikea, who took to the ocean and was saved by the gods.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/ngai-tahu/page-1|title=Early history [of Ng\u0101i Tahu]|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn yet another telling says that Chief Uenuku made a canoe for the nobility and was preparing the hair of all 70 of his noble children for their first sail inside of it. Uenuku himself, combed, oiled, and tied the hair of every last one of them, except Ruatapu. When Ruatapu asked why his father had not treated his hair, Uenuku told him he could not because he was the only son of a slave woman, and his hair was not tapu like his brothers'. This put Ruatapu to shame, and so he refused to eat dinner that night, instead going down to the canoe and putting a hole in its bottom, before filling it with wood chips and hiding the canoe's bailer. In the morning when they launched the canoe, Ruatapu hid the hole with his heel. When they were far out at sea he released the hole and removed the chips. The water rushed in, and nobody could find the bailer as Ruatapu had hidden it on shore. Everybody drowned, except Paikea, who was saved through his mother's ancestor [[Tangaroa]] who summoned the whale. Ruatapu's last attempt at killing Paikea was to use an incantation to hurl waves at him. This backfired as Paikea was too far away now, and the waves just rolled back onto Ruatapu thus drowning him.<ref name=\"TeAo\">{{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao40TeA/c5.html|title=The Story of Paikea and Ruatapu|publisher=Te Puna M\u0101tauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ng\u0101ti Porou tradition===\nIn a tradition of Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutiaterangi ahead of him in status. Ruatapu lured Kahutiaterangi and a large number of young men of high birth into his canoe, and took them out to sea where he drowned them.  He called on the gods to destroy his enemies and threatened to return as the great waves of early summer,<ref name=\"Reedy1997\">{{cite book|author=Reedy, Anaru|date=1997|title=Ng\u0101 K\u014drero a Pita K\u0101piti: The Teachings of Pita K\u0101piti|location=Christchurch|publisher=Canterbury University Press|pp=83-85)}}</ref> shouting out to Kahutiaterangi that he would return to fight him: \"The great waves of the eighth month, they are me!

Michael League explains that, in the early days of the original 10-piece band, if someone got an opportunity to earn more money than for the band's gig, \"...we'd get a substitute and if the substitute played well, then it felt like, 'Well, they learned the music and played great, what a waste for them to learn all that for one gig...' so we would kind of just keep them in the Rolodex, so to speak, and rotate them in and out. Then it became a thing where we started touring so much that guys couldn't do all the dates, or didn't want to, or whatever.\" When people came in, the differences in their playing would influence all those on the date. \"That would change the way that they played the music. And then even when that new person left, that memory of that new relationship with the music would remain. So really we just kept building on the personalities of the new people that would come in, brick by brick. ...in general, the guys understand what the band is\u2013 a rotating cast... But I don't really think of Snarky Puppy as a collective. It's just a large band and sometimes people aren't there. It doesn't feel like a revolving door, it doesn't feel anonymous at all. The guys who have played gigs with us the least have still played several hundred gigs. That's more than most people play with their own bands. So it's very much a tight, familial unit. Everyone feels very, very close and very essential, also.\"<ref>{{cite web

Michael League explains that, in the early days of the original 10-piece band, if someone got an opportunity to earn more money than for the band's gig, \"...we'd get a substitute and if the substitute played well, then it felt like, 'Well, they learned the music and played great, what a waste for them to learn all that for one gig...' so we would kind of just keep them in the Rolodex, so to speak, and rotate them in and out. Then it became a thing where we started touring so much that guys couldn't do all the dates, or didn't want to, or whatever.\" When people came in, the differences in their playing would influence all those on the date. \"That would change the way that they played the music. And then even when that new person left, that memory of that new relationship with the music would remain. So really we just kept building on the personalities of the new people that would come in, brick by brick. ...in general, the guys understand what the band is\u2013 a rotating cast... But I don't really think of Snarky Puppy as a collective. It's just a large band and sometimes people aren't there. It doesn't feel like a revolving door, it doesn't feel anonymous at all. The guys who have played gigs with us the least have still played several hundred gigs. That's more than most people play with their own bands. So it's very much a tight, familial unit. Everyone feels very, very close and very essential, also.\"<ref>{{cite web

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Donald Fagen: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Dolby's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break. The remnants of this transition can still be heard at the beginning of the full-length version of \"Airwaves\" used on other configurations of the album.\n\n===1982 First US release: Columbia

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Thomas Dolby: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Dolby's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

In 2015, Jenks began working for [[Epic Records]] as a sound engineer, leaving a year later to focus on his own career.\n\nJenks began producing for [[Young Nudy]] and [[Trippie Redd]] in 2016.<ref name=\"Vice\" /> He met Playboi Carti in February 2017, collaborating on the track \"[[Woke Up Like This]]\" and producing most tracks on his debut project.<ref name=vice /> Their song \"[[Magnolia (song)|Magnolia]]\" peaked at 29 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This kickstarted Jenks' producing career, producing songs for [[21 Savage]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Rich the Kid]], [[Lil Yachty]], [[Famous Dex]], [[Nav (rapper)|Nav]], [[Young Thug]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Jenks has also released a series of mixtapes called ''The Life of Pi'erre'' and has his own imprint, SossHouse, at Interscope Records.<ref name=massappeal>{{cite web|url=https://massappeal.com/pierre-bourne-took-over-sound-2017-interview/|title=Mass Appeal|website=Mass Appeal}}</ref>\nHe produced Travis Scott's single \"[[Watch (song)|Watch]]\" which features [[Kanye West]] and Lil Uzi Vert. He also produced Playboi Carti's album ''[[Die Lit]]''. He also helped produce for Kanye West's albums [[Ye (album)|''Ye'']] and ''[[Jesus Is King]]''.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, Pi\u2019erre Bourne & close collaborator [[Young Nudy]] dropped their collaborative mixtape titled \u201c[[Sli\u2019merre]]\u201d. The project, which consists of 12 songs, featured rising hip-hop stars [[DaBaby]] and [[Megan Thee Stallion]], along with Nudy's cousin and multi-platinum rapper [[21 Savage]] as well as fellow multi-platinum recording artist [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. All songs on the mixtape were produced by Pi\u2019erre, and hit #1 on [[Apple Music]]\u2019s US All Genres chart, and debuted at #167 on the [[Billboard 200]], later peaking at #63 in the following week. On March 25, 2020, Jenks debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 Producers chart, thanks to four production credits on the deluxe edition of [[Lil Uzi Vert]]'s sophomore album, [[Eternal Atake]].<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9342872/pierre-bourne-tops-hot-100-producers-chart-lil-uzi-vert-eternal-atake|title=Pi'erre Bourne Tops Hot 100 Producers Chart, Powered by Lil Uzi Vert's 'Eternal Atake'|website=Billboard}}</ref>\n\n== Artistry ==\nJenks is influenced by [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[J Dilla]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Kanye West]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/30/pierre-bourne-beat-construction-interview-magnolia|title=Meet Pi\u2019erre Bourne, The \u201cMagnolia\u201d Producer Who Always Trusts His Gut'|publisher=FADER}}</ref> Like West, Jenks wants to continue to work as a producer, while pursuing his own rap career.<ref name=fader />\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
