The sash around the waist may be worn in daily attire, but the sash from shoulder to hip is worn on ceremonial occasions only. Ceremonial sashes are also found in a V-shaped format, draping from both shoulders to the stomach like a large necklace.Or a [[graffiti]] tag.\n\n==Aristocratic and civilian use==\n[[File:Prince Louis of Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Nemours by Winterhalter.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours]] wearing a red sash (Legion of Honour) together with his ceremonial military uniform.

In [[France]] and [[Italy]], sashes, featuring the national flag [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]s and worn on the right shoulder, are used by public authorities and local officials, such as legislators, in public ceremonial events.\n\nSashes traditionally form part of formal military attire (compare the sword-belt known as a [[baldric]], and the [[cummerbund]]). Most of the European [[royal families]] wear sashes as a part of their royal (and/or military) [[regalia]]. Some [[order (distinction)|order]]s such as the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] include sashes as part of the seniormost grades' insignia. Likewise Italian military officers wear light blue sashes over the right shoulder on ceremonial occasions.\n\n==Military use==\n[[File:French Foreign Legion dsc06878.jpg|thumb|150px|The sashes of the [[French Foreign Legion]] are blue.]]\nSashes are a distinctive feature of some regiments of the modern French Army for parade dress.

US Generals continued to wear buff silk sashes in full dress until 1917. In the [[Confederate Army]], sash colour indicated the corps or status of the wearer.  For example: gold for cavalry, burgundy for infantry, black for chaplains, red for sergeants, green or blue for medics, and grey or cream for general officers. With the exception of the West Point Band Drum Major, today the West Point cadet officer is the only person in the US Army who wears a sword and sash, the sole guardian of the tradition.<ref>Fredrick Todd Col USAR Cadet Gray page 40</ref><ref>West Point Band</ref>\n\nThe modern [[British Army]] retains a scarlet sash for wear in certain orders of dress by sergeants and above serving in [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s, over the right shoulder to the left hip. A similar crimson silk net sash is worn around the waist by officers of the [[Foot Guards]] in scarlet full dress and officers of line infantry in dark blue \"Number 1\" dress. The same practice is followed in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies.\n\nThe present day armies of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] both make extensive use of waist-sashes for ceremonial wear. The colours vary widely according to regiment or branch and match those of the turbans where worn. Typically two or more colours are incorporated in the sash, in vertical stripes. One end hangs loose at the side and may have an ornamental fringe. The practice of wearing distinctive regimental sashes or cummerbunds goes back to the late nineteenth century.<ref>John Gaylor, \"Sons of John Company - the Indian and Pakistan Armies\", {{ISBN|0-946771-98-7}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to those detailed above, several other modern armies retain waist-sashes for wear by officers in ceremonial uniforms. These include the armies of Norway (crimson sashes), Sweden (yellow and blue), Greece (light blue and white), the Netherlands (orange), Portugal (crimson) and Spain (red and gold for generals, light blue for general staff and crimson for infantry officers).<ref>Rinaldo D'Ami, \"World Uniforms in Colour - the European Nations\", {{ISBN|0-85059-031-0}}</ref> The Spanish  [[Regulares]] (infantry descended from colonial regiments formerly recruited in [[Spanish Morocco]]) retain their historic waist-sashes for all ranks in colours that vary according to the unit.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Bueno, Ej\u00e9rcito Espa\u00f1ol, Uniformes Contempor\u00e1neos\",{{ISBN|84-7140-186-X}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1914 waist-sashes in distinctive national colours were worn as a peace-time mark of rank by officers of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies, amongst others. Japanese officers continued the practice in full dress uniform until 1940.<ref>Ritta Nakanishi, \"Japanese Military Uniforms 1930-1945, 1991 Dai Nippon Kaiga</ref>\n\nCross-belts resembling sashes are worn by Drum Majors in the Dutch, British and some Commonwealth armies. These carry scrolls bearing the names of battle honours.\n\n==Modern civilian and cultural use==\n[[File:Miss World 07 ZiLin Zhang.jpg|thumb|160px|Winner of a [[beauty pageant]] wearing two sashes]]\n[[File:President_Bouterse.JPG|thumb|160px|[[D\u00e9si Bouterse|President of Republic of Suriname]] wearing a ceremonial V-style sash]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], the sash has picked up a more ceremonial and less practical purpose. Sashes are used at higher education [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]], by [[high school]] homecoming parade nominees, in [[beauty pageant]]s, as well as by corporations to acknowledge high achievement.\n\nIn [[Canada]], hand-woven sashes (called ''[[Ceinture fl\u00e9ch\u00e9e|ceintures fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es]]'' and sometimes \"L'Assomption sash\" after a town in which they were mass-produced) were derived from [[Iroquois|Iroquoiuan]] carrying belts sometime in the 18th century. As a powerful multi-use tool this sash found use in the [[fur trade]] which brought it into the North West. In this period the weave got tighter and size expanded, with some examples more than four metres in length. Coloured thread was widely used. Today it is considered to be primarily a symbol of the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] Patriotes and the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], especially [[Northern Ireland]], the sash is a symbol of the [[Orange Order]]. Orange Order sashes were originally of the ceremonial shoulder-to-hip variety as worn by the British military. Over the 20th century the sash has been mostly replaced by V-shaped collarettes, which are still generally referred to as sashes. The item is celebrated in the song '[[The Sash my Father Wore]]'.\n\nSashes are also worn by Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and Beauty Pageant Participants.  Badges are sewn onto the sash, to indicate achievements of the Scout.\n\nSashes are part of the [[diplomatic uniform]] of many countries.\n\nMany modern schools of Chinese martial arts use sashes of various colors to denote rank as a reflection of the Japanese ranking system using belts.\n\nThe Japanese equivalent of a sash, ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', serves to hold a [[kimono]] or [[yukata]] together.\n\n== Honorific orders ==\nSashes are indicative of holding the class of [[Grand Cross]] or Grand Cordon in a [[chivalric order]] or an [[order of merit]]. The sash is usually worn from the right shoulder to the left hip. A few orders do the contrary, according to their traditional statute.\n\n[[File:William in uniform.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] wearing Garter Riband and Star.]]\n[[File:1720s Knight of the Garter sash.jpg|thumbnail|100px|1720s Garter sash.]]\n\n=== Orders with the sash worn on the left shoulder ===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2013}}\n\n'''Europe : '''\n* {{Flag|Denmark}} :  [[Order of the Elephant]]<ref>[http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Wedding+Danish+Crown+Prince+Frederik+Mary+_xhhu353Zsfl.jpg Photo], King [[Albert II of Belgium]], [[Queen Sofia of Spain]] and [[Queen Paola of Belgium]] wearing a sash of the order</ref>\n* {{Flag|Iceland}} :  [[Order of the Falcon]] <ref>[http://cdn.theroyalforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=39887&d=1094730612 Royal Swedish Family] during a State visit in Iceland</ref>\n* {{Flag|Kingdom of Serbia}} :  [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]]<ref>[http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/2010/06/les-invites-royaux-au-mariage-princier-premieres-photos/ \"Noblesse et Royaut\u00e9s\" blog], Victoria of Sweden's wedding, June 2010, [http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/16.jpg Prince Alexander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710004735/http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/16.jpg |date=2013-07-10 }} wearing it on left shoulder</ref>\n* {{Flag|United Kingdom}} :  [[Order of the Garter]] <!-- [http://madhattery.royalroundup.com/2009/10/iraq-memorial-service-hrh-the-princess-royal/] -->\n* {{Flag|United Kingdom}} ([[Scotland]]) :  [[Order of the Thistle]] <ref>[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v398/gigi_ho/drws/feb24_18.jpg Photo] of Princess Anne wearing the Thistle at King Harald V's 70th birthday in 02/2007</ref>\n\n'''Asia : '''\n* {{Flag|South Korea}} : [[Grand Order of Mugunghwa]]<ref>[http://home.earthlink.net/~dfifer/index.htm South Korea's honour System], click on \"Methods of Wear\"</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : [[Order of the Royal House of Chakri]] <ref>[http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chakri00.htm Royal Cabinet Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424035956/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chakri00.htm |date=2008-04-24 }}</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : [[Order of Chula Chom Klao]]  <ref>[http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chula01.htm Royal Cabinet Website]</ref><ref>State visit of Sweden in Thailand, 2003, [http://cdn.theroyalforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2984&d=1046237710 Gala dinner]</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) on left shoulder '''but''' Knight Grand Cross (First Class) : right shoulder, for :\n** [[Order of the White Elephant]] <ref>Royal Cabinet Website, [http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_WhiteEle00.htm Order of the White Elephant ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924134736/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_WhiteEle00.htm |date=2005-09-24 }}</ref>\n** [[Order of the Crown of Thailand]] <ref>Royal Cabinet Website, [http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Crown00.htm Order of the Crown of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717123459/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Crown00.htm |date=2007-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n'''Malaysia :'''  \n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80%\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#aaccff\" | {{Flagicon|Malaysia}}  Federation of [[Malaysia]]\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Decorations !! | Post-nominal !! colspan=2| Grade !! | Ribbon !!

The sash around the waist may be worn in daily attire, but the sash from shoulder to hip is worn on ceremonial occasions only. Ceremonial sashes are also found in a V-shaped format, draping from both shoulders to the stomach like a large necklace.\n\n==Aristocratic and civilian use==\n[[File:Prince Louis of Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Nemours by Winterhalter.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours]] wearing a red sash (Legion of Honour) together with his ceremonial military uniform. Date 1840s.]]\nIn [[Latin America]] and some countries of [[Africa]], a special [[presidential sash]] indicates a [[President (government title)|president]]'s authority. In [[France]] and [[Italy]], sashes, featuring the national flag [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]s and worn on the right shoulder, are used by public authorities and local officials, such as legislators, in public ceremonial events.\n\nSashes traditionally form part of formal military attire (compare the sword-belt known as a [[baldric]], and the [[cummerbund]]). Most of the European [[royal families]] wear sashes as a part of their royal (and/or military) [[regalia]]. Some [[order (distinction)|order]]s such as the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] include sashes as part of the seniormost grades' insignia. Likewise Italian military officers wear light blue sashes over the right shoulder on ceremonial occasions.\n\n==Military use==\n[[File:French Foreign Legion dsc06878.jpg|thumb|150px|The sashes of the [[French Foreign Legion]] are blue.]]\nSashes are a distinctive feature of some regiments of the modern French Army for parade dress. They are worn Algerian or zouave form the sash (\"ceinture de laine\") was four metres in length and forty centimetres in width. In the historic [[Army of Africa (France)|French Army of Africa]], sashes were worn around the waist in either blue for European or red for indigenous troops.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Jouineau, pages 45-63, \"The French Army in 1914\", {{ISBN|978-2-352-50104-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sashvanda.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Elaborately emboroidered sash from 1635-1642.]] \nAt the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) silk sashes in crimson were authorized for officers and red woolen sashes for non-commissioned officers of the regular [[US Army]] (''Army Regulations of 1861''). US Generals continued to wear buff silk sashes in full dress until 1917. In the [[Confederate Army]], sash colour indicated the corps or status of the wearer.  For example: gold for cavalry, burgundy for infantry, black for chaplains, red for sergeants, green or blue for medics, and grey or cream for general officers. With the exception of the West Point Band Drum Major, today the West Point cadet officer is the only person in the US Army who wears a sword and sash, the sole guardian of the tradition.<ref>Fredrick Todd Col USAR Cadet Gray page 40</ref><ref>West Point Band</ref>\n\nThe modern [[British Army]] retains a scarlet sash for wear in certain orders of dress by sergeants and above serving in [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s, over the right shoulder to the left hip. A similar crimson silk net sash is worn around the waist by officers of the [[Foot Guards]] in scarlet full dress and officers of line infantry in dark blue \"Number 1\" dress. The same practice is followed in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies.\n\nThe present day armies of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] both make extensive use of waist-sashes for ceremonial wear. The colours vary widely according to regiment or branch and match those of the turbans where worn. Typically two or more colours are incorporated in the sash, in vertical stripes. One end hangs loose at the side and may have an ornamental fringe. The practice of wearing distinctive regimental sashes or cummerbunds goes back to the late nineteenth century.<ref>John Gaylor, \"Sons of John Company - the Indian and Pakistan Armies\", {{ISBN|0-946771-98-7}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to those detailed above, several other modern armies retain waist-sashes for wear by officers in ceremonial uniforms. These include the armies of Norway (crimson sashes), Sweden (yellow and blue), Greece (light blue and white), the Netherlands (orange), Portugal (crimson) and Spain (red and gold for generals, light blue for general staff and crimson for infantry officers).<ref>Rinaldo D'Ami, \"World Uniforms in Colour - the European Nations\", {{ISBN|0-85059-031-0}}</ref> The Spanish  [[Regulares]] (infantry descended from colonial regiments formerly recruited in [[Spanish Morocco]]) retain their historic waist-sashes for all ranks in colours that vary according to the unit.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Bueno, Ej\u00e9rcito Espa\u00f1ol, Uniformes Contempor\u00e1neos\",{{ISBN|84-7140-186-X}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1914 waist-sashes in distinctive national colours were worn as a peace-time mark of rank by officers of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies, amongst others. Japanese officers continued the practice in full dress uniform until 1940.<ref>Ritta Nakanishi, \"Japanese Military Uniforms 1930-1945, 1991 Dai Nippon Kaiga</ref>\n\nCross-belts resembling sashes are worn by Drum Majors in the Dutch, British and some Commonwealth armies. These carry scrolls bearing the names of battle honours.\n\n==Modern civilian and cultural use==\n[[File:Miss World 07 ZiLin Zhang.jpg|thumb|160px|Winner of a [[beauty pageant]] wearing two sashes]]\n[[File:President_Bouterse.JPG|thumb|160px|[[D\u00e9si Bouterse|President of Republic of Suriname]] wearing a ceremonial V-style sash]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], the sash has picked up a more ceremonial and less practical purpose. Sashes are used at higher education [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]], by [[high school]] homecoming parade nominees, in [[beauty pageant]]s, as well as by corporations to acknowledge high achievement.\n\nIn [[Canada]], hand-woven sashes (called ''[[Ceinture fl\u00e9ch\u00e9e|ceintures fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es]]'' and sometimes \"L'Assomption sash\" after a town in which they were mass-produced) were derived from [[Iroquois|Iroquoiuan]] carrying belts sometime in the 18th century. As a powerful multi-use tool this sash found use in the [[fur trade]] which brought it into the North West. In this period the weave got tighter and size expanded, with some examples more than four metres in length. Coloured thread was widely used. Today it is considered to be primarily a symbol of the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] Patriotes and the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], especially [[Northern Ireland]], the sash is a symbol of the [[Orange Order]]. Orange Order sashes were originally of the ceremonial shoulder-to-hip variety as worn by the British military. Over the 20th century the sash has been mostly replaced by V-shaped collarettes, which are still generally referred to as sashes. The item is celebrated in the song '[[The Sash my Father Wore]]'.\n\nSashes are also worn by Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and Beauty Pageant Participants.  Badges are sewn onto the sash, to indicate achievements of the Scout.\n\nSashes are part of the [[diplomatic uniform]] of many countries.\n\nMany modern schools of Chinese martial arts use sashes of various colors to denote rank as a reflection of the Japanese ranking system using belts.\n\nThe Japanese equivalent of a sash, ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', serves to hold a [[kimono]] or [[yukata]] together.\n\n== Honorific orders ==\nSashes are indicative of holding the class of [[Grand Cross]] or Grand Cordon in a [[chivalric order]] or an [[order of merit]]. The sash is usually worn from the right shoulder to the left hip. A few orders do the contrary, according to their traditional statute.\n\n[[File:William in uniform.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] wearing Garter Riband and Star.]]\n[[File:1720s Knight of the Garter sash.jpg|thumbnail|100px|1720s Garter sash.]]\n\n=== Orders with the sash worn on the left shoulder ===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2013}}\n\n'''Europe : '''\n* {{Flag|Denmark}} :  [[Order of the Elephant]]<ref>[http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Wedding+Danish+Crown+Prince+Frederik+Mary+_xhhu353Zsfl.jpg Photo], King [[Albert II of Belgium]], [[Queen Sofia of Spain]] and [[Queen Paola of Belgium]] wearing a sash of the order</ref>\n* {{Flag|Iceland}} :  [[Order of the Falcon]] <ref>[http://cdn.theroyalforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=39887&d=1094730612 Royal Swedish Family] during a State visit in Iceland</ref>\n* {{Flag|Kingdom of Serbia}} :  [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]]<ref>[http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/2010/06/les-invites-royaux-au-mariage-princier-premieres-photos/ \"Noblesse et Royaut\u00e9s\" blog], Victoria of Sweden's wedding, June 2010, [http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/16.jpg Prince Alexander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710004735/http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/nr01/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/16.jpg |date=2013-07-10 }} wearing it on left shoulder</ref>\n* {{Flag|United Kingdom}} :  [[Order of the Garter]] <!-- [http://madhattery.royalroundup.com/2009/10/iraq-memorial-service-hrh-the-princess-royal/] -->\n* {{Flag|United Kingdom}} ([[Scotland]]) :  [[Order of the Thistle]] <ref>[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v398/gigi_ho/drws/feb24_18.jpg Photo] of Princess Anne wearing the Thistle at King Harald V's 70th birthday in 02/2007</ref>\n\n'''Asia : '''\n* {{Flag|South Korea}} : [[Grand Order of Mugunghwa]]<ref>[http://home.earthlink.net/~dfifer/index.htm South Korea's honour System], click on \"Methods of Wear\"</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : [[Order of the Royal House of Chakri]] <ref>[http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chakri00.htm Royal Cabinet Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424035956/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chakri00.htm |date=2008-04-24 }}</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : [[Order of Chula Chom Klao]]  <ref>[http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Chula01.htm Royal Cabinet Website]</ref><ref>State visit of Sweden in Thailand, 2003, [http://cdn.theroyalforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2984&d=1046237710 Gala dinner]</ref>\n* {{Flag|Thailand}} : Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) on left shoulder '''but''' Knight Grand Cross (First Class) : right shoulder, for :\n** [[Order of the White Elephant]] <ref>Royal Cabinet Website, [http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_WhiteEle00.htm Order of the White Elephant ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924134736/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_WhiteEle00.htm |date=2005-09-24 }}</ref>\n** [[Order of the Crown of Thailand]] <ref>Royal Cabinet Website, [http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Crown00.htm Order of the Crown of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717123459/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Crown00.htm |date=2007-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n'''Malaysia :'''  \n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80%\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#aaccff\" | {{Flagicon|Malaysia}}  Federation of [[Malaysia]]\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Decorations !! | Post-nominal !! colspan=2| Grade !! | Ribbon !!

Since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexing Crimea]] in 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] has administered Sevastopol as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]. Nevertheless, [[Ukraine]] and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a [[city with special status]] within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.\n\nSevastopol has a population of {{Crimea-census2014|393,304|punct=,}} concentrated mostly near the [[Sevastopol Bay]] and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a [[closed city]].\n\nAlthough relatively small at {{convert|864|km2}}, Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors [[Commonwealth of Independent States|from the former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, [[dolphin]]s have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''[[sebastos]]'', 'venerable') and the noun {{lang |grc|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} (''p\u00f3lis'') ('city'). {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} is the traditional Greek equivalent ([[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.\n\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]\") [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th{{citation needed| date= December 2012}} (or 4th) century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Cherson\u0113sos [[Taurica|Taurik\u0113]]'' (\"the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula\").\n\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''; the previously common spelling ''Sebastopol'' is still used by some publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.

The Greek city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesus]] existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.\n\n===Part of the Russian Empire===\n[[File:\"Soldier and Sailor\" Memorial to Heroic Defenders of Sevastopol.jpg|thumb|\"Soldier and Sailor\" Memorial to Heroic Defenders of Sevastopol]]\n[[File:2012-09-09 \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0432 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435 (1).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Monument to the Sunken Ships]], dedicated to ships destroyed during the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, designed by [[Amandus Adamson]]]]\nSevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://leksika.com.ua/19111014/ure/sevastopol | contribution = Sevastopol | title = The Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia | publisher = Leksika | place = [[Ukraine|UK]]| title-link = Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia }}</ref> (''White Cliff''),<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/ | contribution = Sevastopol | title = The Great Soviet Encyclopedia | publisher = Yandex | place = [[Russia|RU]]| title-link = Great Soviet Encyclopedia }}</ref> by Rear Admiral [[Thomas MacKenzie (Russian admiral)|Thomas MacKenzie]] (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native [[Scottish people|Scot]] in Russian service; soon after [[Russian Empire|Russia]] annexed the [[Crimean Khanate]].

In February 1784, [[Catherine the Great]] ordered [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigory Potemkin]] to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain [[Fyodor Ushakov]] who in 1788 was named commander of the [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and of the Black Sea squadron.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm|title=\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya) |trans-title=Foundation and development of Sevastopol | publisher = Sevastopol.info|date=28 May 2007| accessdate=26 April 2010|language=Russian}}</ref> It became an important [[naval base]] and later a commercial [[seaport]]. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\n\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]], and [[Ottoman Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[panorama]] of the siege originally was created by [[Franz Roubaud]]. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''\u2014and [[Karl-Ger\u00e4t|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]]. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"''Theoderichshafen''\" (in reference to [[Theoderic the Great]] and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic [[Goths]] until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City]] title a year later.\n\n===Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR===\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"[[closed city]]\".

The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\n\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha.

Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes.

[[Crimean Peninsula]] and a major [[Black Sea]] port. Since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexing Crimea]] in 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] has administered Sevastopol as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]. Nevertheless, [[Ukraine]] and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a [[city with special status]] within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.\n\nSevastopol has a population of {{Crimea-census2014|393,304|punct=,}} concentrated mostly near the [[Sevastopol Bay]] and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a [[closed city]].\n\nAlthough relatively small at {{convert|864|km2}}, Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors [[Commonwealth of Independent States|from the former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, [[dolphin]]s have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''[[sebastos]]'', 'venerable') and the noun {{lang |grc|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} (''p\u00f3lis'') ('city'). {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} is the traditional Greek equivalent ([[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.\n\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]\") [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th{{citation needed| date= December 2012}} (or 4th) century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Cherson\u0113sos [[Taurica|Taurik\u0113]]'' (\"the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula\").\n\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''; the previously common spelling ''Sebastopol'' is still used by some publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''. In English, the current spelling also has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|v|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|o\u028a|l}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|s|\u025b|v|\u0259|\u02c8|s|t|o\u028a|p|\u0259l}},<ref name=OED-US>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sevastopol|title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word |work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> whilst the former spelling has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|\u1d7b|\u02c8|b|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|\u0259l|,_|-|p|\u0252|l}}<ref name=OED-b>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> or {{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|b|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|o\u028a|l|,_|-|p|\u0252|l}}.<ref name=OED-US-b>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref>\n* {{Lang-uk|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c}}; {{Lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c}}, pronounced {{IPA-uk|sew\u0250\u02c8st\u0254pol\u02b2|}} in Ukrainian and {{IPA-ru |s\u02b2\u026av\u0250\u02c8stop\u0259l\u02b2|}}<ref name=OED>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Sevastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> in Russian.\n* {{lang-crh|Aqyar}}, pronounced {{IPA-tt|aq\u02c8jar|}}.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Crimea}}\n\n[[File:Sevastopol 04-14 img36 Chersonesus.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the ancient Greek theatre in [[Chersonesos Taurica]]]]\n\n{{Quote box |width=23em |align=left |bgcolor=#B0D4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=85% |quote=<poem>\nChersonesus founded in 6th century BC\nHellenic Colonies 6th century BC \u2013 480 BC\n[[Bosporan Kingdom]] 480 BC \u2013 107 BC\n[[Kingdom of Pontus]] 107 BC \u2013 63 BC\n[[Roman Republic]] 63 BC\u201327 BC\n[[Roman Empire]] 27 BC \u2013 330\n[[Byzantine Empire]] 330\u20131204\n[[Empire of Trebizond]] 1204\u20131461\n[[Principality of Theodoro]] 1461\u20131475\n[[Crimean Khanate]] 1475\u20131783 (Ottoman vassal from 1478 to 1774)\n[[Russian Empire]] 1783\u20131917\nFounded as Sevastopol in 1783\n[[Russian Republic]] 1917\n[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1917\u20131942\n[[Nazi Germany]] 1942\u20131944\n[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1944\u20131954\n[[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1954\u20131991\n[[Ukraine]] 1991\u20132014 (''de jure'' \u2013 present)\n[[Russia|Russian Federation]] 2014\u2013present\n</poem>\n}}\n\nIn the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesus]] existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned.

The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain [[Fyodor Ushakov]] who in 1788 was named commander of the [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and of the Black Sea squadron.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm|title=\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya) |trans-title=Foundation and development of Sevastopol | publisher = Sevastopol.info|date=28 May 2007| accessdate=26 April 2010|language=Russian}}</ref> It became an important [[naval base]] and later a commercial [[seaport]]. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\n\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]], and [[Ottoman Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[panorama]] of the siege originally was created by [[Franz Roubaud]]. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''\u2014and [[Karl-Ger\u00e4t|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]]. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"''Theoderichshafen''\" (in reference to [[Theoderic the Great]] and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic [[Goths]] until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City]] title a year later.\n\n===Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR===\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"[[closed city]]\". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.\n\nOn 29 October 1948, the Presidium of Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued a ''ukase'' (order) which confirmed the special status of the city.<ref name=myths/> Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], indicated that Sevastopol, [[Crimean Oblast]] was part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' 1976, Vol.23. pp 104).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/|title=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438|work=yandex.ru|access-date=3 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817005956/http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/|archive-date=17 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR.

The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long [[Bay of Sevastopol]]. This bay is a [[ria]], a river canyon drowned by [[Holocene]] sea-level rise, and the outlet of [[Chorna River (Crimea)|Chorna River]]. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of [[Balaklava]] (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\n\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\n\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of [[Crimean mountains]] are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\n\n===Climate===\nSevastopol has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa''),<ref name=\"koppen\">{{cite journal| last=Kottek | first=M.|author2=J.
