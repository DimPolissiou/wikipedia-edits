These colors are not a result of [[pigmentation]], but are an example of [[iridescence]] through [[structural coloration]]. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=P.

The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings.<ref name=Siddique_Morpho_coloration>{{cite journal |last1=Siddique |first1=R.

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. ''Morpho''s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.\n*The genus ''Morpho'' is palatable, but some species (such as ''[[Morpho amathonte|M. amathonte]]'') are very strong fliers; birds\u2014even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing\u2014find it very hard to catch them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Allen M. |year=1971 |title=Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators |journal=Oecologia |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013222 |doi=10.1007/bf00345212|pmid=28311247 }}</ref> The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]],<ref name=\"pinheiro\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinheiro |first1=Carlos E.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]]. More famous is [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], who was not wealthy.\n\nThe people along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in [[Brazil]] once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (''[[Morpho menelaus|M. menelaus]]'') by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured. The butterflies wobble in flight and are easy to catch.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Morpho didius Male Ventre MHNT.jpg|''M. didius'' \u2013 ventral side: Predatory birds aim their attack at the most prominent feature, the ocelli, missing the body entirely.\nFile:Bluemorphobutterfly.jpg|''[[Morpho peleides|M. peleides]]'', note the symmetric notches left by a bird beak\nFile:White Morpho wings closed.JPG|''[[Morpho polyphemus|M. polyphemus]]'', one of several \"white morpho\" species\nFile:Morpho rhetenor rhetenor MHNT dos.jpg|''[[Morpho rhetenor|M. rhetenor]]'' \u2013 this museum specimen is used for education, but thousands are killed for domestic displays, sold to tourists or in gift shops.\nFile:Morphobutterfly.jpg|''[[Morpho richardus|M. richardus]]'' sunning itself for warmth\nFile:Morpho hecuba hecuba MHNT dos.jpg|''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'', the largest morpho, with a wingspan of up to {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}}\nFile:MorphoherculesandMorphothamyrisSizecomparison.JPG|''M. hecuba'' size comparison with ''M. thamyris'' (''M. portis'')\nFile:Morpho butterfly with wings closed, Corcovado, Costa Rica, Dec 2014.jpg|The closed wings of this morpho butterfly are damaged, allowing some of the blue to show.\n</gallery>\n\n== Illustrations ==\n<gallery>\nFile:MorphoAchillesMerian.jpg|[[Maria Sibylla Merian]] ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium'' 1705\nFile:Cramer&Stoll-uitlandsche kapellen vol. 1- plate 027.jpg|[[Pieter Cramer]] and [[Caspar Stoll]] ''De Uitlandsche Kapellen'' 1775\u20131782\nFile:Cramer&Stoll-uitlandsche kapellen vol. 1- plate 028.jpg|Pieter Cramer and Caspar Stoll'' De Uitlandsche Kapellen'' 1775\u20131782\nFile:ShawNaturalists MiscellanyAchilles.jpg|[[George Shaw]] and [[Frederick Polydore Nodder]]''The Naturalist's Miscellany'' 1789\u20131813\nFile:Hubner1821SammlExotSchmett2Plate73.jpg| [[Jacob H\u00fcbner|H\u00fcbner]] ''Sammlung exotischer Schmetterlinge'' Augsburg [1806-1841]\nFile:LucasMorphomenelaus.jpg| [[Hippolyte Lucas]] ''Histoire Naturelle des Lepidopteres Exotiques'' Paris,1835.\nFile:NovaraExpZoologischeTheilLepidopteraAtlasTaf63.jpg|[[Baron Cajetan von Felder|Cajetan]] and [[Rudolf Felder]] ''Reise der \u00d6sterreichischen Fregatte Novara um die Erde in den Jahren 1857, 1858, 1859''\nFile:Biolcam.jpg|[[Frederick DuCane Godman]] and [[Osbert Salvin]] ''Biologia Centrali-Americana'' 1879\u20131915\nFile:SeitzFA2.jpg|[[Adalbert Seitz]] ''Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde'' 1860\u20131938\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregions]] (Neotropical)\n*[[Tropical Andes]]\n*''[[Arhopala]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1992 | title = Morfologia comparada da cabe\u00e7a das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae (Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 9 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 261\u2013271 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751992000200012| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1994 | title = Morfologia comparada do torax das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae (Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 691\u2013713 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751994000400014| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1994 | title = Morfologia comparada do abdome das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae(Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 737\u2013748 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751994000400016| doi-access = free }}\n*Blandin, P.

The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings.<ref name=Siddique_Morpho_coloration>{{cite journal |last1=Siddique |first1=R.

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. ''Morpho''s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.\n*The genus ''Morpho'' is palatable, but some species (such as ''[[Morpho amathonte|M. amathonte]]'') are very strong fliers; birds\u2014even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing\u2014find it very hard to catch them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Allen M. |year=1971 |title=Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators |journal=Oecologia |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013222 |doi=10.1007/bf00345212|pmid=28311247 }}</ref> The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]],<ref name=\"pinheiro\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinheiro |first1=Carlos E.

The iridescent wings are used in the manufacture of [[jewelry]] and as inlay in [[woodworking]]. Papered specimens are sold with the abdomen removed to prevent its oily contents from staining the wings. Significant quantities of live specimens are exported as pupae from several Neotropical countries for exhibition in butterfly houses. Unfortunately, due to their irregular flight pattern and size, their wings are frequently damaged when in captivity.\n\n== Host plants ==\n''Morpho'' larvae, variously according to species and region, feed on [[Leguminosae]], [[Gramineae]], [[Canellaceae]], [[Guttiferae]], [[Erythroxylaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Moraceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Sapindaceae]], [[Rhamnaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Musaceae]], [[Palmae]], [[Menispermaceae]], [[Tiliaceae]], [[Bignoniaceae]], and [[Menispermaceae]].\n\nAccording to Penz and DeVries<ref name=\"Penz, C.M. & P.J.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]]. More famous is [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], who was not wealthy.\n\nThe people along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in [[Brazil]] once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (''[[Morpho menelaus|M. menelaus]]'') by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured.

Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al.

When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.\n\nHis mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/hd_mati.htm Magdalena Dabrowski Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Source: Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954) | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 30 June 2010.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Henri + Am\u00e9lie Matisse Portrait 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Two greyscale photos where each photo is in the shape of an oval: Henri Matisse (left) and Am\u00e9lie Matisse (right)|Henri and Am\u00e9lie Matisse, 1898]]\n[[File:Reading henri matisse.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Woman Reading]]'' (''La Liseuse''), 1895, oil on board, 61.5 x 48 cm, [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]]]]\nMatisse was born in [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Northern France, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant.<ref>Spurling, Hilary (2000).

He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of [[appendicitis]].

Initially he painted [[still life]]s and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], and [[Antoine Watteau]], as well as by modern artists, such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and by [[Japanese art]]. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Spurling, Hilary.

Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\n\nIn 1907, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=Britannica>{{Britannica|369401}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangier]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name=\"The Moroccans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588|title=Henri Matisse.

One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]]s, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] with her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein, and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=19 October 2014 }}, Baltimore Museum of Art.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:\n\n<blockquote>\"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings\u2014and the C\u00e9zannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 84</ref>'</blockquote>\n\nAmong Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], the poets [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marie Laurencin]] (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 94-95</ref>\n\nHis friends organized and financed the ''Acad\u00e9mie Matisse'' in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists. It operated from 1907 until 1911. The initiative for the academy came from the Steins and the [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9#D\u00f4miers|D\u00f4miers]], with the involvement of [[Hans Purrmann]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], and [[Sarah Stein]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&pg=PA64&dq=Hans+Purrmann+and+Sarah+Stein,+students+of+matisse&hl=en&sa=X&ei=flmbVZOWE4uBUaXhvJAL&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France, 1900\u20131940'', Pelican History of Art Series, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 64], {{ISBN|0300099088}}</ref>\n\nMatisse spent seven months in [[Morocco]] from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings.

His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This \"[[return to order]]\" is characteristic of much post-[[World War I]] art, and can be compared with the [[neoclassicism]] of Picasso and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] as well as the return to traditionalism of [[Andr\u00e9 Derain|Derain]].\nMatisse's [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[odalisque]] paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.<ref>Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981). ''Paris in the Third Reich: A History of the German Occupation, 1940\u20131944''. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref> He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary. Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/> Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works.

Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chapel and museum===\n\nIn 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]], which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, [[chasubles]], and tabernacle door\u2014all planned using the cut-out method\u2014had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.<ref>{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 9] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 }}</ref><br />\n\nThis project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite him being an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henri Matisse: Modernist Against the Grain|year=2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035123|author=Catherine Bock-Weiss|page=147|quote=Natural enough, since he was surrounded by priests and nuns during his later illnesses and while working on the Venice Chapel, even though he remained a convinced atheist.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/arts/design/29jacques.html ''Sister Jacques-Marie Influence for Matisse's Rosary Chapel, Dies'', NY Times, 29 September 2005] Retrieved 27 July 2010</ref> They had met again in [[Vence]] and started the collaboration, a story related in her 1992 book ''Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence'' and in the 2003 documentary \"A Model for Matisse\".<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/030630_matisse.html French Professor Directs \"Model for Matisse\"], Carnegie Mellon Today, 30 June 2003.

Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al.

When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.\n\nHis mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/hd_mati.htm Magdalena Dabrowski Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Source: Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954) | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 30 June 2010.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Henri + Am\u00e9lie Matisse Portrait 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Two greyscale photos where each photo is in the shape of an oval: Henri Matisse (left) and Am\u00e9lie Matisse (right)|Henri and Am\u00e9lie Matisse, 1898]]\n[[File:Reading henri matisse.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Woman Reading]]'' (''La Liseuse''), 1895, oil on board, 61.5 x 48 cm, [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]]]]\nMatisse was born in [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Northern France, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant.<ref>Spurling, Hilary (2000).

In 1887, he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]] after gaining his qualification. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of [[appendicitis]].

Initially he painted [[still life]]s and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], and [[Antoine Watteau]], as well as by modern artists, such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and by [[Japanese art]]. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Spurling, Hilary.

Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\n\nIn 1907, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=Britannica>{{Britannica|369401}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangier]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name=\"The Moroccans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588|title=Henri Matisse.

One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]]s, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] with her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein, and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=19 October 2014 }}, Baltimore Museum of Art.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:\n\n<blockquote>\"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings\u2014and the C\u00e9zannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 84</ref>'</blockquote>\n\nAmong Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], the poets [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marie Laurencin]] (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 94-95</ref>\n\nHis friends organized and financed the ''Acad\u00e9mie Matisse'' in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists. It operated from 1907 until 1911. The initiative for the academy came from the Steins and the [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9#D\u00f4miers|D\u00f4miers]], with the involvement of [[Hans Purrmann]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], and [[Sarah Stein]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&pg=PA64&dq=Hans+Purrmann+and+Sarah+Stein,+students+of+matisse&hl=en&sa=X&ei=flmbVZOWE4uBUaXhvJAL&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France, 1900\u20131940'', Pelican History of Art Series, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 64], {{ISBN|0300099088}}</ref>\n\nMatisse spent seven months in [[Morocco]] from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings.

His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This \"[[return to order]]\" is characteristic of much post-[[World War I]] art, and can be compared with the [[neoclassicism]] of Picasso and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] as well as the return to traditionalism of [[Andr\u00e9 Derain|Derain]].\nMatisse's [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[odalisque]] paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.<ref>Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them.  Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981). ''Paris in the Third Reich: A History of the German Occupation, 1940\u20131944''. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref>  He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary.  Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/>  Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works.

Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chapel and museum===\n\nIn 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]], which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, [[chasubles]], and tabernacle door\u2014all planned using the cut-out method\u2014had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.<ref>{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 9] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 }}</ref><br />\n\nThis project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite his being an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henri Matisse: Modernist Against the Grain|year=2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035123|author=Catherine Bock-Weiss|page=147|quote=Natural enough, since he was surrounded by priests and nuns during his later illnesses and while working on the Venice Chapel, even though he remained a convinced atheist.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/arts/design/29jacques.html ''Sister Jacques-Marie Influence for Matisse's Rosary Chapel, Dies'', NY Times, 29 September 2005] Retrieved 27 July 2010</ref> They had met again in [[Vence]] and started the collaboration, a story related in her 1992 book ''Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence'' and in the 2003 documentary \"A Model for Matisse\".<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/030630_matisse.html French Professor Directs \"Model for Matisse\"], Carnegie Mellon Today, 30 June 2003.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile. After successful completion of sea trials the ship was transferred to her owners on the same day and immediately departed for London.<ref name=mar1>{{cite news |title=Trial Trips. |date=1 December 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=177 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nAs built, the ship was {{convert|465|ft|0|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]) and {{convert|59|ft|4|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], a [[mean]] [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|30|ft|4+1/2|in|m}}.<ref name=lloyds/> ''Waratah'' was assessed at {{GRT|9339}} and {{NRT|6004}} and had [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] of approximately 10,000.<ref name=lloyds/> The vessel had a steel hull, and two sets of [[quadruple-expansion steam engine]]s, with cylinders of {{convert|23|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|32+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|46+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|67|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter with a {{convert|48|in|cm|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]], that provided a combined 1,003 [[nominal horsepower|nhp]] and drove two screw propellers, and moved the ship at up to {{convert|13+1/2|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=lloyds/> ''Waratah'' had a cellular [[double bottom]] built along her entire length, and the hull was divided into eight [[watertight compartment]]s, which it was claimed rendered her \"practically immune from any danger of sinking.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69965453 |title=S.S.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\".\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThe sighting by the ''Clan MacIntyre'' was the final confirmed sighting of the ''Waratah'', there were however several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the vicinity of the steamer and the lights vanished. The mate of the ''Harlow'' thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year). The captain agreed and did not even enter the events in the log \u2013 only when he learnt of the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' did he think the events significant.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}} Reportedly the ''Harlow'' was {{convert|180|mi|km}} from Durban.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189442/the_new_york_times/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 1909 |page=6 |title=Saw Steamer Blow Up. |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 September 1909 |title=The Loss of the Waratah. |page=12 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189605/the_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible sighting, which was not disclosed to the Inquiry at the time, was by Edward Joe Conquer, a [[Cape Mounted Riflemen|Cape Mounted Rifleman]] who on 28 July 1909, was posted to carry out military exercises on the banks of the mouth of the [[Xora River]] along with Signaller H.Adshead. He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears only started to grow, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

Further attempts to locate the ''Waratah'' took place in 1983, 1989, 1991, 1995 and 1997.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''.

The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the Chief Officer of the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThe sighting by the ''Clan MacIntyre'' was the final confirmed sighting of the ''Waratah'', there were however several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

Fears only started to grow, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

As punishment, he must stay in the house except as sent by his mother to help their elderly neighbor Miss Volker whom, upon Jack's arrival, boils her hands in water and bites off the blisters, which results in Jack getting a nosebleed. Aside from that, Miss Volker also writes obituaries for the town newspaper. She notices that elderly, \"original Norvelters\" are dying away relatively fast. Later, a [[Hells Angel]] gang member is hit by a [[Concrete mixer|cement truck]] near the Norvelt pants factory after crazily dancing a three-mile stretch from a [[Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania|Mt. Pleasant]] bar. This ends up causing the rest of the Hells Angel gang to cause mayhem in the town, lighting unoccupied houses on fire and stealing the most expensive casket from Mr. Huffer's funeral parlor for their fallen brother.\n\nLater, Jack's dad acquires a [[Piper J-3 Cub]], and assigns Jack to dig an underground [[bomb shelter]] as his dad builds a runway for the plane. Around this time, Jack has a red [[Plymouth Valiant#1960\u20131962|Plymouth Valiant]] promised to him from Miss Volker as a birthday present after he had been driving it as Miss Volkers chauffeur. As Jack thinks about the strange rate of deaths in original Norvelters, he realizes that [[Thin Mints (Girl Scout Cookie)|thin mint]] Girl Scout cookies given out to the original Norvelters through the Community Center may have something to do with it because many of those people rely on it, along with his mom's  homemade casseroles, for food. Soon, Miss Volker is placed under [[house arrest]] when the police find chocolates, gifted to her by her one-way lover Mr. Spizz, poisoned with [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] (to kill rodents) in her basement and accuse her of feeding them to the old Norvelters. Later, Jack gets a call from Mr. Spizz, who was supervising Miss Volkers house arrest, to come down to her house. When Jack gets there, Miss Volker says that Mr. Spizz had admitted to secretly poisoning the Original Norvelters to try to get her to marry him, and that he had stolen Jack's car to get a six-hour headstart on the county police.\n\nThe book concludes with Jack being picked up in his dad's J-3 and doing some \"bombing runs\" with paint-filled balloons on the Viking drive-in theater, during which he decides it isn't that fun and asks to be let down back on the ball field. Finally, an inset paragraph (styled after the \"In this day in history\" section Miss Volker employed Jack to type along with the obits in the Norvelt news) talks about Jack being ungrounded.\n\n==Themes==\nIn the book ''Dead End In Norvelt'', people use power to control others.

Norvelt was a [[New Deal]] town built by the US government to house poor families and named after [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], described by Miss Volker as 'the greatest American woman who has ever lived'.\"<ref name=lacey/>\n\n==Level==\nAnother Irish reviewer suggested that \"every Elder will be able to relate to Jack's character\" and recommended the book for readers age 9 to 13.<ref name=krazykesh/> The ''Guardian'' Prize judges recommended it for ages 12 and up.<ref name=2012longlist/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Children's literature |Biography }} <!-- delete \"bar\" when there are about two ordinary See also -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ALSC2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/2012-alsc-book-and-media-award-winners|title=2012 ALSC book and media award winners |publisher=[[Association for Library Service to Children]]|accessdate=2012-01-24}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"O'Dell Award\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hbook.com/2012/01/blogs/read-roger/2012-scott-odell-award-for-historical-fiction/|title=2012 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction|author=Roger Sutton |date=January 17, 2012|work=[[The Horn Book Magazine|The Horn Book]] |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n<ref name=flood>Alison Flood.
