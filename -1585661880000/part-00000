[[Pornography|Pornographic]] films present [[sexual fantasies]] and usually include erotically stimulating material such as [[nudity in film|nudity]] ([[Softcore pornography|softcore]]) and [[sexual intercourse]] ([[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]]). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit [[Sex in film|sexuality]], and focuses more on arousal than [[storytelling]], but the distinction is highly subjective.\n\n[https://yespornpleasexxx.com/ Pornographic films] are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional [[film stock]] in various formats, [[Home video|video for home viewing]], [[DVD]]s, [[Internet pornography|Internet download]], [[cable TV]], in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and [[pay-per-view]] on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing [[adult theater]]s. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on [[free-to-air]] television.\n\nFilms with [[wikt:risqu\u00e9|risqu\u00e9]] content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of [[Film producer|producers]] began to specialize in their production. However, various groups within society considered such depictions [[immoral]], labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under [[obscenity law]]s, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, but could only be distributed by [[Underground press|underground channels]]. Because the viewing of such films carried a [[social stigma]], they were viewed at [[brothel]]s, [[adult movie theater]]s, [[stag party|stag parties]], at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nOnly in the 1970s, during the [[Golden Age of Porn]], were pornographic films semi-legitimized; and by the 1980s, pornography on [[home video]] achieved wider distribution. The rise of the [[Internet]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s similarly changed the way pornographic films were distributed, complicating [[censorship]] regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Pierre Woodman at work in Australia.png|thumb|350px|right|Staff and actors at a pornographic film set in Australia]]\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] or [[hardcore pornography]].

Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the [[Niche market|market]] to which each subgenre appeals.

It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\").

[[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the [[Path\u00e9]] brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find,<ref>Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: ''Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf\u00e4nge der \u00f6sterreichischen Kinematografie''. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-901932-04-6}}.</ref> though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female [[nudity in film]].\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''[[Black and White and Blue]]'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of [[Buenos Aires]] and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is '''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge'''\" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The [[Argentinian]] ''[[El Satario]]'', whose original title could have been ''El S\u00e1tiro'' (''The Satyr''), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-6671-2010-12-05.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: radar|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |date=December 2001 |title=Film Facts |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=978-0-8230-7943-8 |page=256}}</ref>\n\n===1920s\u20131940s suppression===\nPornographic movies were widespread in the [[silent movie]] era of the 1920s, and were often shown in [[brothel]]s. Soon illegal, [[stag films]], or [[erotic films|blue films]], as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.<ref name=history>{{cite video |people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=7 March 2006 |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |medium=DVD |location=Port Washington, NY |publisher=Koch Vision |accessdate=21 October 2006 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time inc |accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n===1950s: home movies ===\nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, [[Harrison Marks]] produced films which were considered risqu\u00e9, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8&nbsp;mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/glamour-new.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1960s: Europe and United States===\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, [[Lasse Braun]] was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] movies which he sold to [[Reuben Sturman]], who distributed them to 60,000 American [[peep show]] booths.<ref>Eric Schlosser, ''Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market'' (Houghton Mifflin Books, 2004), p. 143.</ref> Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director [[Doris Wishman]] began producing a series of eight [[pornographic]] films, or [[nudist]] films without sex scenes, including ''[[Hideout in the Sun]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053908/|title=Hideout in the Sun|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1960), ''[[Nude on the Moon]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056293/|title=Nude on the Moon|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961) and ''[[Diary of a Nudist]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054809/|title=Diary of a Nudist|date=27 December 1961|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961). She also produced a series of [[sexploitation]] films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated [[sexual intercourse]]. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in [[Massachusetts]] allegedly for being [[pornography|pornographic]]. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene,<ref>''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31|title=Film International - Thinking Film Since 1973|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film ''[[Language of Love]]'' (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex [[educational film]], which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the [[Netherlands]], also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, [[child pornography]] and [[bestiality]] porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the [[United States]], producers of pornographic films formed the [[Adult Film Association of America]] in 1969, after the release of ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], to fight against [[censorship]], and to defend the industry against [[obscenity]] charges.<ref name=\"afw0187\">\"10th Annual Erotic Awards,\" ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7</ref>\n\n===1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States ===\nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. However, mainstream theatres would normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of [[adult theater]]s in the [[United States]] and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in [[sex shop]]s that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as ''[[Bordellet]]'' (1972), the [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] (1970\u20131976) and the [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] (1973\u20131978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early ''Bedside''-films included hardcore pornographic scenes.

These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. [[William Rotsler]] expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision.

California]]'' (1973). The case established that [[obscenity]] was not legally protected, but the case also established the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to [[indecency]] (which may or may not be legal).\n\n===1980s: new technology and new legal cases===\nWith the arrival of the home [[video cassette recorder]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like [[Traci Lords]], [[Seka (actress)|Seka]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] and directors such as [[Gregory Dark]]. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. However, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This was the end of the age of big-budget productions; the mainstreaming of pornography had begun. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were now being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.<ref name=history/><ref name=time/> One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the [[camcorder]] spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe year 1987 saw an important legal case in the U.S. when the ''[[de facto]]'' result of [[California v. Freeman]] was the legalization of [[hardcore pornography]]. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.<ref>bluefilm</ref>\n\n===1990s: DVD and the Internet age===\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on [[DVD]]. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format ([[videotape]]) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the [[Internet]] further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos would be ordered from an adult bookstore, or through mail-order; but, with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including [[paysite]]s, [[video hosting service]]s, and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, it was in the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\n[[File:Kim Kardashian West 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|American television personality [[Kim Kardashian]] rose to fame following the release of the pornographic film ''[[Kim Kardashian, Superstar]]'' in 2007, in which she had [[sexual intercourse]] with American singer [[Ray J]].]]\n\n[[Viv Thomas]], [[Paul Thomas (pornographic actor)|Paul Thomas]], [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]], [[Antonio Adamo]], and [[Rocco Siffredi]] were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film production company [[Zentropa]] became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic films, starting with ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced ''[[Idioterne]]'' (1998), directed by [[Lars von Trier]], which won many international awards and was nominated for a [[Golden Palm]] in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). ''Idioterne'' started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'', which starred pornstar [[Rocco Siffredi]].\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel [[Kanal K\u00f8benhavn]] started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the [[Copenhagen]] area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of [[Innocent Pictures]], a company started by Zentropa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|title=Kanal K\u00f8benhavn - Erotik og Kontakt|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228194319/http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|archivedate=28 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. More recently, the Internet has served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, webcams and webcam recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n=== 2000s: competition and contraction ===\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by [[streaming media]] delivery over the [[Internet]], competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.<ref name=theroux-guardian-jun2012/>\n\n==Pornographic film industry==\n{{see also|Sex industry}}\n\n===Economics===\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion<ref name=2013Industry>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=After rough 2013, porn studios look for a better year \u2013 \"Globally, porn is a $97 billion industry, according to Kassia Wosick, assistant professor of sociology at New Mexico State University.

Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the [[sexualization]] of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of [[feminist pornography]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/22/porn-women \"'Porn made for women, by women\"] May, Catalina.

Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013</ref> In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of [[physical attractiveness]].\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\n===Legal status===\n{{Main|List of pornography laws by region}}\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=394&invol=557|title=STANLEY v. GEORGIA|work=Findlaw|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on [[prostitution]] charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]''. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely ''portraying'' a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.<ref name=\"cbsnews2003\"/><ref>But see news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209182130/http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=Webmaster Ray Guhn Arrested in Florida |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |website=xbiz.com }}</ref> The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\n:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm |title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 43: Public Indecency |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Texas Legislature}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-71 |title=18 USC Chapter 71 - OBSCENITY &#124; Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure &#124; U.S. Code &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is personal possession in the home [[Stanley v. Georgia]].\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] affirmed in [[Miller v. California]] that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n# whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n# whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the [[Muslim world]] and [[China]], but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n=== Health issues ===\nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of [[condom]]s, with an accompanying risk of [[sexually transmitted disease]] among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of [[HIV]] infection which led to the deaths through [[AIDS]] of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basten |first1=Fred |last2=Holmes |first2=Laurie |last3=Holmes |first3=John C. |title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades.

[[Pornography|Pornographic]] films present [[sexual fantasies]] and usually include erotically stimulating material such as [[nudity in film|nudity]] ([[Softcore pornography|softcore]]) and [[sexual intercourse]] ([[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]]). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit [[Sex in film|sexuality]], and focuses more on arousal than [[storytelling]], but the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional [[film stock]] in various formats, [[Home video|video for home viewing]], [[DVD]]s, [[Internet pornography|Internet download]], [[cable TV]], in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and [[pay-per-view]] on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing [[adult theater]]s. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on [[free-to-air]] television.\n\nFilms with [[wikt:risqu\u00e9|risqu\u00e9]] content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of [[Film producer|producers]] began to specialize in their production. However, various groups within society considered such depictions [[immoral]], labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under [[obscenity law]]s, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, but could only be distributed by [[Underground press|underground channels]]. Because the viewing of such films carried a [[social stigma]], they were viewed at [[brothel]]s, [[adult movie theater]]s, [[stag party|stag parties]], at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nOnly in the 1970s, during the [[Golden Age of Porn]], were pornographic films semi-legitimized; and by the 1980s, pornography on [[home video]] achieved wider distribution. The rise of the [[Internet]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s similarly changed the way pornographic films were distributed, complicating [[censorship]] regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Pierre Woodman at work in Australia.png|thumb|350px|right|Staff and actors at a pornographic film set in Australia]]\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] or [[hardcore pornography]].

Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the [[Niche market|market]] to which each subgenre appeals.

[[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the [[Path\u00e9]] brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find,<ref>Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: ''Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf\u00e4nge der \u00f6sterreichischen Kinematografie''. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-901932-04-6}}.</ref> though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female [[nudity in film]].\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''[[Black and White and Blue]]'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of [[Buenos Aires]] and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is '''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge'''\" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The [[Argentinian]] ''[[El Satario]]'', whose original title could have been ''El S\u00e1tiro'' (''The Satyr''), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-6671-2010-12-05.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: radar|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |date=December 2001 |title=Film Facts |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=978-0-8230-7943-8 |page=256}}</ref>\n\n===1920s\u20131940s suppression===\nPornographic movies were widespread in the [[silent movie]] era of the 1920s, and were often shown in [[brothel]]s. Soon illegal, [[stag films]], or [[erotic films|blue films]], as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.<ref name=history>{{cite video |people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=7 March 2006 |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |medium=DVD |location=Port Washington, NY |publisher=Koch Vision |accessdate=21 October 2006 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time inc |accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n===1950s: home movies ===\nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, [[Harrison Marks]] produced films which were considered risqu\u00e9, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8&nbsp;mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/glamour-new.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1960s: Europe and United States===\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, [[Lasse Braun]] was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] movies which he sold to [[Reuben Sturman]], who distributed them to 60,000 American [[peep show]] booths.<ref>Eric Schlosser, ''Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market'' (Houghton Mifflin Books, 2004), p. 143.</ref> Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director [[Doris Wishman]] began producing a series of eight [[pornographic]] films, or [[nudist]] films without sex scenes, including ''[[Hideout in the Sun]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053908/|title=Hideout in the Sun|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1960), ''[[Nude on the Moon]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056293/|title=Nude on the Moon|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961) and ''[[Diary of a Nudist]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054809/|title=Diary of a Nudist|date=27 December 1961|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961). She also produced a series of [[sexploitation]] films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated [[sexual intercourse]]. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in [[Massachusetts]] allegedly for being [[pornography|pornographic]]. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene,<ref>''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31|title=Film International - Thinking Film Since 1973|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film ''[[Language of Love]]'' (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex [[educational film]], which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the [[Netherlands]], also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, [[child pornography]] and [[bestiality]] porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the [[United States]], producers of pornographic films formed the [[Adult Film Association of America]] in 1969, after the release of ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], to fight against [[censorship]], and to defend the industry against [[obscenity]] charges.<ref name=\"afw0187\">\"10th Annual Erotic Awards,\" ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7</ref>\n\n===1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States ===\nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. However, mainstream theatres would normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of [[adult theater]]s in the [[United States]] and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in [[sex shop]]s that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as ''[[Bordellet]]'' (1972), the [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] (1970\u20131976) and the [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] (1973\u20131978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early ''Bedside''-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.dk/solgtebilletter.php|title=Scope > Flest solgte billetter|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> and all remain favourites on [[home video]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekkofilm.dk/?allowbreak=false&id=472 |title=Sengekant (inkl. en uges skiferie) |language=Danish |work=Ekko.dk |accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]] was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. [[William Rotsler]] expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision. Nothing can stop this.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Eric |date=Fall 2005 |title=Dirty Little Secrets: Scholars, Archivists, and Dirty Movies |journal=The Moving Image |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=79\u2013105 |doi=10.1353/mov.2005.0034}}</ref> In Britain, however, ''Deep Throat'' was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.<ref name=time/><ref>{{cite news |last=Hattenstone |first=Simon |date=11 June 2005 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1504240,00.html |title=After 33 years, Deep Throat, the film that shocked the US, gets its first British showing |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5410268.stm |title=Porn film on 'landmark 100' list |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=28 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nOne important court case in the U.S. was ''[[Miller v. California]]'' (1973). The case established that [[obscenity]] was not legally protected, but the case also established the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to [[indecency]] (which may or may not be legal).\n\n===1980s: new technology and new legal cases===\nWith the arrival of the home [[video cassette recorder]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like [[Traci Lords]], [[Seka (actress)|Seka]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] and directors such as [[Gregory Dark]]. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. However, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This was the end of the age of big-budget productions; the mainstreaming of pornography had begun. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were now being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.<ref name=history/><ref name=time/> One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the [[camcorder]] spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe year 1987 saw an important legal case in the U.S. when the ''[[de facto]]'' result of [[California v. Freeman]] was the legalization of [[hardcore pornography]]. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.<ref>bluefilm</ref>\n\n===1990s: DVD and the Internet age===\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on [[DVD]]. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format ([[videotape]]) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the [[Internet]] further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos would be ordered from an adult bookstore, or through mail-order; but, with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including [[paysite]]s, [[video hosting service]]s, and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, it was in the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\n[[File:Kim Kardashian West 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|American television personality [[Kim Kardashian]] rose to fame following the release of the pornographic film ''[[Kim Kardashian, Superstar]]'' in 2007, in which she had [[sexual intercourse]] with American singer [[Ray J]].]]\n\n[[Viv Thomas]], [[Paul Thomas (pornographic actor)|Paul Thomas]], [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]], [[Antonio Adamo]], and [[Rocco Siffredi]] were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film production company [[Zentropa]] became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic films, starting with ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced ''[[Idioterne]]'' (1998), directed by [[Lars von Trier]], which won many international awards and was nominated for a [[Golden Palm]] in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). ''Idioterne'' started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'', which starred pornstar [[Rocco Siffredi]].\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel [[Kanal K\u00f8benhavn]] started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the [[Copenhagen]] area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of [[Innocent Pictures]], a company started by Zentropa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|title=Kanal K\u00f8benhavn - Erotik og Kontakt|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228194319/http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|archivedate=28 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. More recently, the Internet has served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, webcams and webcam recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n=== 2000s: competition and contraction ===\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by [[streaming media]] delivery over the [[Internet]], competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.<ref name=theroux-guardian-jun2012/>\n\n==Pornographic film industry==\n{{see also|Sex industry}}\n\n===Economics===\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion<ref name=2013Industry>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=After rough 2013, porn studios look for a better year \u2013 \"Globally, porn is a $97 billion industry, according to Kassia Wosick, assistant professor of sociology at New Mexico State University.

Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the [[sexualization]] of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of [[feminist pornography]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/22/porn-women \"'Porn made for women, by women\"] May, Catalina. The Guardian, 22 March 2011.

Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013</ref> In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of [[physical attractiveness]].\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\n===Legal status===\n{{Main|List of pornography laws by region}}\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=394&invol=557|title=STANLEY v. GEORGIA|work=Findlaw|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on [[prostitution]] charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]''. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely ''portraying'' a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.<ref name=\"cbsnews2003\"/><ref>But see news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209182130/http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=Webmaster Ray Guhn Arrested in Florida |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |website=xbiz.com }}</ref> The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\n:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm |title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 43: Public Indecency |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Texas Legislature}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-71 |title=18 USC Chapter 71 - OBSCENITY &#124; Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure &#124; U.S. Code &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is personal possession in the home [[Stanley v. Georgia]].\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] affirmed in [[Miller v. California]] that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n# whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n# whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the [[Muslim world]] and [[China]], but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n=== Health issues ===\nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of [[condom]]s, with an accompanying risk of [[sexually transmitted disease]] among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of [[HIV]] infection which led to the deaths through [[AIDS]] of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basten |first1=Fred |last2=Holmes |first2=Laurie |last3=Holmes |first3=John C. |title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades.

It's Alive was formed by ex-LAZY members [[Per Aldeheim]] and Kim Bj\u00f6rkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \"Martin White\". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in [[Cyprus]]. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of [[Megarock Records]] offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the ''[[Metal Forces]]'' magazine.\n\nThe decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer [[Denniz PoP]]'s label [[Cheiron Studios|Cheiron Records]], a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] affiliate. After recording their second album ''[[Earthquake Visions]]'', they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. ''Earthquake Visions'' eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.\n\n===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===\n\"I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years\u2013day and night\u2013in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on\". \u2013 Max Martin, 19 March 2001.<ref>Chu, Jeff (19 March 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064227/http://maxmartinfansite.com/Time-Top%20of%20the%20Pops.htm \"Top of the Pops\"].

They both worked on [[Ace of Base]]'s second album, ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]'' (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by [[3T]], [[Army of Lovers]] and [[Leila K]].

[[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of \"[[Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)]]\" (1996), co-written with [[Herbie Crichlow]], a single which quickly went [[Platinum single|platinum]] and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the singles \"[[As Long as You Love Me (Backstreet Boys song)|As Long As You Love Me]]\" (1997) and \"[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]\" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8 million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully.<ref>As of late May 2016, Martin was not known to have possessed any knowledge of the illegal activities of [[Lou Pearlman]], who then managed the Backstreet Boys.</ref> Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Robyn]]'s hits \"[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]\" and \"[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]\" which ended up on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 10.<ref name=Ostroff/>\n\nIn 1998, [[Cheiron Productions]] worked on albums by [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[Jessica Folcker]]. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and [[Dr. Alban]], and her debut album ''Jessica'' became an instant hit with singles like \"Tell Me What You Like\" and \"How Will I Know Who You Are\" which both sold [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer [[Rami Yacoub]], who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with [[Bryan Adams]] during this time, \"Cloud Number Nine\" and \"Before The Night Is Over\".\n\n===Backstreet Boys===\nMartin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'' (1999), including all the singles. \"[[I Want It That Way]]\", a hit song Martin co-wrote with [[Andreas Carlsson]] and co-produced with [[Kristian Lundin]], became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today.

When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on [[Stockholm Records]], [[Lisa Miskovsky]] wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys' hit single \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky's own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's third album ''[[Black & Blue (Backstreet Boys album)|Black & Blue]]'' (2000). In the first week of release, \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. ''Black & Blue'', containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6 million units in its first week in America. Martin again received [[ASCAP]]'s award \"Songwriter of the Year\" both in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Songwriters Behind 'NSYNC, Backstreet Boys Hits Win Big At ASCAP Pop Awards | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443980/20010523/backstreet_boys.jhtml |date=23 May 2001 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member [[Brian Littrell]] invited Martin to collaborate on their single \"[[In A World Like This]]\". The single peaked at ''No.6'' in the ''[[Oricon Singles Chart|Oricon]]'' chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the ''Never Gone'' songs \"Climbing the Walls\", \"[[Just Want You to Know]]\", \"Siberia\" and \"[[I Still...]]\". Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys' earlier work.\n\n===Westlife===\nMartin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote [[Westlife]]'s song \"I Need You\" for the first Westlife album ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song \"[[You Make Me Feel (Westlife song)|You Make Me Feel]]\" for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000). Max Martin, [[Rami Yacoub]], and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife's hits, \"[[When You're Looking Like That]]\", for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000).\n\n===Britney Spears===\nIn 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced [[Britney Spears|Spears]]' hit \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" for her debut album of the [[...Baby One More Time (album)|same title]].<ref>Fully titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\", the selection was so titled because Martin, in one of his by-then rare failures in command of English, had mistaken \"hit\" for American slang that supposedly meant \"ring\" or \"call\", both references to [[telephone]] conversations.</ref> (The single had originally been offered to both the [[Backstreet Boys]], who had turned it down, and [[TLC (music)|TLC]], who had passed because they were \"taking time off\".)<ref name=\"tlcindependent\">{{cite news| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023| title = Rock&Pop: Story of the song '...Baby One More Time'| accessdate = 19 May 2007| publisher = Findarticles.com|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021053000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref> The single remained Spears's best-selling single to date, and on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\", it was ranked at number 7. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single \"[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]\". By 1999, the album ''...Baby One More Time'' had sold over 15 million copies in the U.S., certifying [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond Status]]. Also, within a year of its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' had become the best-selling [[Compact disc|LP]] by a teenager in history, selling over 30 million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award \"Songwriter of the Year\" in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.\n\nMartin worked on Spears's first three studio albums\u20141999's ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]],'' mentioned above, 2000's ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],'' and 2001's ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]''\u2014all three of which were made in the style of [[Teen pop|teen-oriented pop]]. In this period he co-wrote and co-produced the singles \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" (2000), \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" (2000), \"[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]\" (2000), \"[[Overprotected]]\" (2001), and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" (2002). However, when Spears recorded her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), she decided to move away from that genre. The duo ended up parting ways, and Martin had no input on that album nor on her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled, \"If U Seek Amy\", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Different from Martin's previous tracks for Spears, \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" is an electro-pop dance song, in which even the lyrics shows a different, more dance-oriented direction from Spears's and Martin's previous work.\n\nIn July 2009, Spears stated, on her Twitter account, that she was in the recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden with Martin.<ref>[http://www.britneyspears.com/2009/07/a-tweet-from-britney-15.phpp A Tweet from Britney]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. britneyspears.com (12 July 2009)</ref> Later, on 29 September 2009, it was announced that Martin had worked with Spears on her upcoming compilation album. Martin produced \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", the song debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nMartin was the executive producer (along with [[Dr. Luke]]) of Spears's seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). During a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' Spears stated that Martin \"gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don't want musically. His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds, which I love\". She added: \"There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Britney Spears On Her New Album, Her Favorite Music and Working With will.i.am|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-on-her-new-album-her-favorite-music-and-working-with-will-i-am-20110317|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|magazine=RollingStone.com}}</ref> In January 2011, \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\" was released as the lead single of Spears's new album; the song later debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Spears's second single to debut at No. 1 and her fourth overall.

As well as co-producing \"Hold It Against Me\" and \"Till the World Ends\", Martin co-produced the songs \"Inside Out\", \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", \"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"[[Criminal (Britney Spears song)|Criminal]]\", and \"Up n' Down\". In May 2011, it was announced that \"I Wanna Go\" would serve as the third single from ''Femme Fatale.''<ref name=confirm>{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |title=Britney Confirms 'I Wanna Go' As Next Single |publisher=Britney.com |author=BRITannica |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204859/http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}</ref> On 5 August 2011, Spears launched a poll on her [[Facebook]] page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"[[Inside Out (Britney Spears song)|Inside Out]]\" or \"[[(Drop Dead) Beautiful]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668729/will-drop-dead-beautiful-be-britney-spears-next-single.jhtml|title=Will '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' Be Britney Spears' Next Single?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}</ref> After the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single, marking the first time Martin had produced four singles of a Spears album; he had produced the first three singles from ''Oops!... I Did It Again.''\n\nMartin did not contribute to Spears's eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]''.\n\n===C\u00e9line Dion===\nIn late 1999 [[C\u00e9line Dion]] released \"[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]\", a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her [[greatest hits]] album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]].'' The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.\nIn 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion's album ''[[One Heart]].'' One of them, called \"[[Faith (Celine Dion song)|Faith]]\", was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\n===Producer role for Cheiron===\nThe traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!\u2026 I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:\n{{cquote|I want to be part of every note, every single moment going on in the studio. I want nothing forgotten, I want nothing missed. I'm a perfectionist. The producer should decide what kind of music is being made, what it's going to sound like\u2013all of it, the why, when and how.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |title=Practicing the Fine Art of Production |publisher=maxmartinfansite.com |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064309/http://maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 }}</ref> \u2013 LA Times, 6/05/00}}\n\n===Startup of Maratone===\nDespite the success, [[Cheiron Studios]] was closed down in 2000. The reason behind the decision to close it down was, according to the press release on their homepage, that the heart and soul of the studio had been lost with the death of [[Denniz PoP]]. Another reason for closing the studio down was for the people at Cheiron Studios to be able to do more experimental music work without the weight of the now famous name Cheiron upon their shoulders.\n\nMax Martin and Tom Talomaa started a new production company together named [[Maratone]] in January 2001 and moved into the famous [[Cosmos Studios]] that had housed the production team Kai Erixon and [[Kent (Gillstr\u00f6m) Isaacs]] whom had been very successful at the Swedish pop/hiphop-arena with numerous gold/platinum-selling artists. Also, [[David Kreuger]] and [[Per Magnusson]] started A Side Productions and [[Kristian Lundin]] started the production company [[The Location]] and the publishing company [[Location Songs]] together with Jake Schulze and [[Andreas Carlsson]] (both also members of Cheiron's production team) at the same location as Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for [[Britney Spears]]'s third album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, [[Arn\u00fe\u00f3r Birgisson|Arnthor]] and young sensation [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], but Rami, Alexandra and Arnthor have all moved on since then. Following the work with [[Celine Dion]] on the album ''[[One Heart]]'' in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005. More recently 2009 has seen a string of hits from the studio including the hits \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" from Kelly Clarkson and \"3\" from Britney Spears.\n\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn 2004, former [[American Idol]] winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and [[Luke Gottwald|Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]] on songs for her second studio album ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]].'' They decided to create songs that were rockier than had been anticipated by the fans, as can be heard on the hit singles \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" (2004) and \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\" (2005). \"Since U Been Gone\" became a huge hit, and it remained one of the biggest hits of Clarkson's career, and one of the biggest hits of 2005. The next single, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 while the single \"Since U Been Gone\" was still on the charts. In 2009, he also co-wrote Clarkson's single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", which established the record for the highest ''Billboard'' Hot 100 jump to No. 1, jumping from No. 97 in its second week on the chart.\n\n===Marion Raven===\nIn 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer [[Marion Raven]] for the release of her debut album, titled ''[[Here I Am (Marion Raven album)|Here I Am]],'' on what might be his first mainstream Rock work, writing the song \"[[Break You]]\" and co-writing with Raven many songs, including \"[[End of Me (Marion Raven song)|End of Me]]\", \"Here I Am\", \"Little By Little\", \"In Spite of Me\", and \"Six Feet Under\". \"End of Me\" and \"Break You\" were big hits in [[Asia]] and Norway. In 2007 \"Break You\" was included again in Raven's North American and European debut album called ''[[Set Me Free (Marion Raven album)|Set Me Free]].'' The American singer Megan McCauley also recorded \"Break You\" in 2006, but the song was not included on any of McCauley's albums.\n\n===The Veronicas===\nIn 2005, Max Martin wrote the first single-song for [[pop punk]] duo [[The Veronicas]], \"[[4ever (The Veronicas song)|4ever]]\", with Lukasz \"[[Dr. Luke]]\" Gottwald for their debut studio album ''[[The Secret Life Of... (album)|The Secret Life Of...]]'' (2005). Also he wrote \"[[Everything I'm Not]]\", the second single-song of The Veronicas, the same year, again with Gottwald, [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], [[Jessica Origliasso]] and [[Lisa Origliasso]] for the same album ''The Secret Life Of....''\n\n===Pink===\nMartin co-wrote and produced three songs on [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s platinum-selling fourth album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'', including two of its most successful singles, \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\" (2006) and \"[[Who Knew]]\" (2006). \"[['Cuz I Can (Pink song)|Cuz I Can]]\" (2007) was released as the seventh single in the Australian market. Martin also collaborated with Pink for her fifth studio album, ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\" (2008), plus the tracks \"[[Please Don't Leave Me]]\" (2009), \"[[I Don't Believe You]]\" (2009), \"It's All Your Fault\" and \"Boring\". Martin and Pink wrote \"[[Whataya Want From Me]]\" during sessions for ''Funhouse'', but ultimately the song was recorded and released as a single by [[Adam Lambert]] to success. Pink's version would appear on her next effort, ''[[Greatest Hits... So Far!!! (Pink album)|Greatest Hits... So Far!!!]]'' (2010). Martin also co-wrote the hits \"[[Raise Your Glass]]\" and \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" for the collection. For her sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), he co-wrote the song \"Slut Like You\". Martin again collaborated with Pink with \"[[Just like Fire]]\" (2016) from the ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' movie soundtrack. For her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), he co-wrote \"[[Revenge (Pink song)|Revenge]]\", \"[[Whatever You Want (Pink song)|Whatever You Want]]\", \"For Now\", and \"Secrets\". In 2019 for her eighth studio album, ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), he co-wrote \"(Hey Why) Miss You Sometime\".\n\n===Usher===\nIn 2010, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Usher (singer)|Usher]]'s song \"[[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts and top-ten on the main Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430708/Usher/chart?f=378|title=Usher \u2013 Chart history|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref> Working together again, Martin co-wrote and co-produced on Usher's seventh studio album \"[[Looking 4 Myself]]\" in 2012 making the [[dance-pop]] song \"[[Scream (Usher song)|Scream]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Alongside the aforementioned trio and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], Max Martin co-wrote the track and the song lived up to its hoped-for success becoming her major breakthrough into the US market, charting at number 6, whilst also topping the charts in the United Kingdom for two weeks. It charted in the top 50 most bought tracks in the US for 2012 and was the 8th best selling song in the same year within the United Kingdom with a sales figure of 749,000 in that year alone.<ref>Lane, Dan.

As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had \"public music education to thank for everything\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moser |first=Whet |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/swedish-pop-mafia-music-world-influence-73966 |title=Swedish Pop Mafia \u2013 Pacific Standard: The Science of Society |publisher=Psmag.com |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Other alumni of the program include [[Andreas Carlsson]], [[Rami Yacoub]], and [[Anders Bagge]].\n\nAs a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a [[Glam metal|glam-style]] metal band called [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive was formed by ex-LAZY members [[Per Aldeheim]] and Kim Bj\u00f6rkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \"Martin White\". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in [[Cyprus]]. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of [[Megarock Records]] offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the ''[[Metal Forces]]'' magazine.\n\nThe decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer [[Denniz PoP]]'s label [[Cheiron Studios|Cheiron Records]], a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] affiliate. After recording their second album ''[[Earthquake Visions]]'', they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. ''Earthquake Visions'' eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.\n\n===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===\n\"I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years\u2013day and night\u2013in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on\". \u2013 Max Martin, 19 March 2001.<ref>Chu, Jeff (19 March 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064227/http://maxmartinfansite.com/Time-Top%20of%20the%20Pops.htm \"Top of the Pops\"]. ''Time'', vol. 157 no. 11</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Martin was hired by [[Cheiron Studios]] and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the [[Rednex]] song \"[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex Song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" in 1994. They both worked on [[Ace of Base]]'s second album, ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]'' (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by [[3T]], [[Army of Lovers]] and [[Leila K]]. To date, ''The Bridge'' has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States.<ref name=\"Ace of Base's USA Certifications\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum Search Results: Ace of Base|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151657/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> When Martin eventually left his band [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in late 1995, he was replaced by [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]].\n\nIn 1995, the Cheiron Studios was hired by [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] to work on Backstreet Boys' self-titled debut album ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996). [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of \"[[Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)]]\" (1996), co-written with [[Herbie Crichlow]], a single which quickly went [[Platinum single|platinum]] and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the singles \"[[As Long as You Love Me (Backstreet Boys song)|As Long As You Love Me]]\" (1997) and \"[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]\" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8 million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully.<ref>As of late May 2016, Martin was not known to have possessed any knowledge of the illegal activities of [[Lou Pearlman]], who then managed the Backstreet Boys.</ref> Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Robyn]]'s hits \"[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]\" and \"[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]\" which ended up on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 10.<ref name=Ostroff/>\n\nIn 1998, [[Cheiron Productions]] worked on albums by [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[Jessica Folcker]]. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and [[Dr. Alban]], and her debut album ''Jessica'' became an instant hit with singles like \"Tell Me What You Like\" and \"How Will I Know Who You Are\" which both sold [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer [[Rami Yacoub]], who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with [[Bryan Adams]] during this time, \"Cloud Number Nine\" and \"Before The Night Is Over\".\n\n===Backstreet Boys===\nMartin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'' (1999), including all the singles. \"[[I Want It That Way]]\", a hit song Martin co-wrote with [[Andreas Carlsson]] and co-produced with [[Kristian Lundin]], became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today. (\"I Want It That Way\" was voted No. 10 in the [[MTV]]/[[Rolling Stone]] list of the \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\".<ref name=\"mtvrollinstones100best\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2000/nov/19/mtv_rolling_stone/\n |title        = MTV, Rolling Stone list top 100 pop songs\n |accessdate   = 20 February 2007\n |archive-url  = https://www.webcitation.org/66fZB4WXF?url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2000/nov/19/mtv_rolling_stone/\n |archive-date = 4 April 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>)\nA VH1 special, 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s, ranked the song at number 3, making it the highest ranked boy-band single and pop song. ''Millennium'' sold over 1.1 million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by [[NSYNC|NSYNC's]] 2000 album ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''), and was the best-selling album in the world. When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on [[Stockholm Records]], [[Lisa Miskovsky]] wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys' hit single \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky's own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's third album ''[[Black & Blue (Backstreet Boys album)|Black & Blue]]'' (2000). In the first week of release, \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. ''Black & Blue'', containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6 million units in its first week in America. Martin again received [[ASCAP]]'s award \"Songwriter of the Year\" both in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Songwriters Behind 'NSYNC, Backstreet Boys Hits Win Big At ASCAP Pop Awards | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443980/20010523/backstreet_boys.jhtml |date=23 May 2001 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member [[Brian Littrell]] invited Martin to collaborate on their single \"[[In A World Like This]]\". The single peaked at ''No.6'' in the ''[[Oricon Singles Chart|Oricon]]'' chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the ''Never Gone'' songs \"Climbing the Walls\", \"[[Just Want You to Know]]\", \"Siberia\" and \"[[I Still...]]\". Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys' earlier work.\n\n===Westlife===\nMartin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote [[Westlife]]'s song \"I Need You\" for the first Westlife album ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song \"[[You Make Me Feel (Westlife song)|You Make Me Feel]]\" for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000). Max Martin, [[Rami Yacoub]], and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife's hits, \"[[When You're Looking Like That]]\", for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000).\n\n===Britney Spears===\nIn 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced [[Britney Spears|Spears]]' hit \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" for her debut album of the [[...Baby One More Time (album)|same title]].<ref>Fully titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\", the selection was so titled because Martin, in one of his by-then rare failures in command of English, had mistaken \"hit\" for American slang that supposedly meant \"ring\" or \"call\", both references to [[telephone]] conversations.</ref> (The single had originally been offered to both the [[Backstreet Boys]], who had turned it down, and [[TLC (music)|TLC]], who had passed because they were \"taking time off\".)<ref name=\"tlcindependent\">{{cite news| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023| title = Rock&Pop: Story of the song '...Baby One More Time'| accessdate = 19 May 2007| publisher = Findarticles.com|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021053000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref> The single remained Spears's best-selling single to date, and on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\", it was ranked at number 7. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single \"[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]\". By 1999, the album ''...Baby One More Time'' had sold over 15 million copies in the U.S., certifying [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond Status]]. Also, within a year of its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' had become the best-selling [[Compact disc|LP]] by a teenager in history, selling over 30 million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award \"Songwriter of the Year\" in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.\n\nMartin worked on Spears's first three studio albums\u20141999's ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]],'' mentioned above, 2000's ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],'' and 2001's ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]''\u2014all three of which were made in the style of [[Teen pop|teen-oriented pop]]. In this period he co-wrote and co-produced the singles \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" (2000), \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" (2000), \"[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]\" (2000), \"[[Overprotected]]\" (2001), and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" (2002). However, when Spears recorded her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), she decided to move away from that genre. The duo ended up parting ways, and Martin had no input on that album nor on her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled, \"If U Seek Amy\", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Different from Martin's previous tracks for Spears, \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" is an electro-pop dance song, in which even the lyrics shows a different, more dance-oriented direction from Spears's and Martin's previous work.\n\nIn July 2009, Spears stated, on her Twitter account, that she was in the recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden with Martin.<ref>[http://www.britneyspears.com/2009/07/a-tweet-from-britney-15.phpp A Tweet from Britney]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. britneyspears.com (12 July 2009)</ref> Later, on 29 September 2009, it was announced that Martin had worked with Spears on her upcoming compilation album. Martin produced \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", the song debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nMartin was the executive producer (along with [[Dr. Luke]]) of Spears's seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). During a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' Spears stated that Martin \"gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don't want musically. His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds, which I love\". She added: \"There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Britney Spears On Her New Album, Her Favorite Music and Working With will.i.am|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-on-her-new-album-her-favorite-music-and-working-with-will-i-am-20110317|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|magazine=RollingStone.com}}</ref> In January 2011, \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\" was released as the lead single of Spears's new album; the song later debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Spears's second single to debut at No. 1 and her fourth overall. Martin also co-produced the album's second single, \"[[Till the World Ends]]\", which peaked at No. 3. As well as co-producing \"Hold It Against Me\" and \"Till the World Ends\", Martin co-produced the songs \"Inside Out\", \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", \"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"[[Criminal (Britney Spears song)|Criminal]]\", and \"Up n' Down\". In May 2011, it was announced that \"I Wanna Go\" would serve as the third single from ''Femme Fatale.''<ref name=confirm>{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |title=Britney Confirms 'I Wanna Go' As Next Single |publisher=Britney.com |author=BRITannica |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204859/http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}</ref> On 5 August 2011, Spears launched a poll on her [[Facebook]] page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"[[Inside Out (Britney Spears song)|Inside Out]]\" or \"[[(Drop Dead) Beautiful]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668729/will-drop-dead-beautiful-be-britney-spears-next-single.jhtml|title=Will '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' Be Britney Spears' Next Single?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}</ref> After the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single, marking the first time Martin had produced four singles of a Spears album; he had produced the first three singles from ''Oops!... I Did It Again.''\n\nMartin did not contribute to Spears's eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]''.\n\n===C\u00e9line Dion===\nIn late 1999 [[C\u00e9line Dion]] released \"[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]\", a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her [[greatest hits]] album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]].'' The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.\nIn 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion's album ''[[One Heart]].'' One of them, called \"[[Faith (Celine Dion song)|Faith]]\", was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\n===Producer role for Cheiron===\nThe traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!\u2026 I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:\n{{cquote|I want to be part of every note, every single moment going on in the studio. I want nothing forgotten, I want nothing missed. I'm a perfectionist. The producer should decide what kind of music is being made, what it's going to sound like\u2013all of it, the why, when and how.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |title=Practicing the Fine Art of Production |publisher=maxmartinfansite.com |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064309/http://maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 }}</ref> \u2013 LA Times, 6/05/00}}\n\n===Startup of Maratone===\nDespite the success, [[Cheiron Studios]] was closed down in 2000. The reason behind the decision to close it down was, according to the press release on their homepage, that the heart and soul of the studio had been lost with the death of [[Denniz PoP]]. Another reason for closing the studio down was for the people at Cheiron Studios to be able to do more experimental music work without the weight of the now famous name Cheiron upon their shoulders.\n\nMax Martin and Tom Talomaa started a new production company together named [[Maratone]] in January 2001 and moved into the famous [[Cosmos Studios]] that had housed the production team Kai Erixon and [[Kent (Gillstr\u00f6m) Isaacs]] whom had been very successful at the Swedish pop/hiphop-arena with numerous gold/platinum-selling artists. Also, [[David Kreuger]] and [[Per Magnusson]] started A Side Productions and [[Kristian Lundin]] started the production company [[The Location]] and the publishing company [[Location Songs]] together with Jake Schulze and [[Andreas Carlsson]] (both also members of Cheiron's production team) at the same location as Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for [[Britney Spears]]'s third album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, [[Arn\u00fe\u00f3r Birgisson|Arnthor]] and young sensation [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], but Rami, Alexandra and Arnthor have all moved on since then. Following the work with [[Celine Dion]] on the album ''[[One Heart]]'' in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005. More recently 2009 has seen a string of hits from the studio including the hits \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" from Kelly Clarkson and \"3\" from Britney Spears.\n\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn 2004, former [[American Idol]] winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and [[Luke Gottwald|Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]] on songs for her second studio album ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]].'' They decided to create songs that were rockier than had been anticipated by the fans, as can be heard on the hit singles \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" (2004) and \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\" (2005). \"Since U Been Gone\" became a huge hit, and it remained one of the biggest hits of Clarkson's career, and one of the biggest hits of 2005. The next single, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 while the single \"Since U Been Gone\" was still on the charts. In 2009, he also co-wrote Clarkson's single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", which established the record for the highest ''Billboard'' Hot 100 jump to No. 1, jumping from No. 97 in its second week on the chart.\n\n===Marion Raven===\nIn 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer [[Marion Raven]] for the release of her debut album, titled ''[[Here I Am (Marion Raven album)|Here I Am]],'' on what might be his first mainstream Rock work, writing the song \"[[Break You]]\" and co-writing with Raven many songs, including \"[[End of Me (Marion Raven song)|End of Me]]\", \"Here I Am\", \"Little By Little\", \"In Spite of Me\", and \"Six Feet Under\". \"End of Me\" and \"Break You\" were big hits in [[Asia]] and Norway. In 2007 \"Break You\" was included again in Raven's North American and European debut album called ''[[Set Me Free (Marion Raven album)|Set Me Free]].''

Until 1994, there was no single television network operating on mainland Tanzania. The only station of the United Republic was [[TVZ|Television Zanzibar]] (TVZ), which was established in the early 1970s.  Whereas other African countries had decided to establish television shortly before or soon after independence Mwalimu [[Julius Kambarage Nyerere]]\u2019s cabinet resisted the introduction of television at all, insisting that the medium was too expensive and that Tanzania\u2019s radio coverage was yet too imperfect. Moreover, it was argued that such an expansion would merely serve the upper and wealthy strata of the population as an entertainment medium. On the contrary, television proponents claimed that the medium could be an effective instrument in the national development process since it produced social awareness among the people. As a consequence acceptance of and participation in various development programmes could be ensured. But in June 1974, President [[Julius Nyerere]] settled the matter by saying: \"When we have a satellite that would make it possible to cover the whole country I will go for television ... and not until then.\u201c As a result, the schemes of many institutions, such as [[UNESCO]], Swedish Telecommunications Administration (Swedtel), [[Nippon Electric Corporation]], or the British Marconi Company, were simply archived. In addition, the importation of TV sets was banned by law in 1974. Despite this, after the launch of many private TV stations, the government decided in 2001 to award a TV channel to TBC.\n\n==Programming==\nProgramming includes news and entertainment. TBC operates its television programs through 3 television profiles namely TBC 1, TBC 2 and newly established Tanzania Safari Channel (A wildlife channel).
