They won the 1966 [[Melody Maker]] Beat Contest, winning a one-year record contract, but had to record songs chosen for them, rather than their own material, and neither of their singles, \"Heart Trouble\" / \"Up And Down\" and \"Supermarket Full of Cans\" / \"Don't Ask Me To Mend Your Broken Heart\", sold well.\n\nThe Eyes moved from [[Decca Records|Decca]] to [[Mercury Records]] and recorded their first album ''Crossroads of Time'' in 1968, which was produced by [[Lou Reizner]]. The album included two tracks written by [[Graham Bond]] \"Crossroads of Time\" and \"Love is the Law\", who was a major influence on Ryan.<ref name=\"TRObit\">{{cite web|last1=Needs|first1=Kris|title=Obituary: Phil Ryan|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-05-04/obituary-phil-ryan|publisher=Team Rock|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> and who also wrote the album sleeve notes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crossroads of Time: Remastered & Expanded Edition - Eyes Of Blue|url=http://shop.cherryred.co.uk/esoteric-exd.asp?id=5239|publisher=Cherry Red Records|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>  Despite poor sales, the album was \"acknowledged as a major influence on the nascent [[Yes (band)|Yes]]\"<ref name=\"TRObit\" />   Reizner then used The Eyes as the backing band for American singer-songwriter [[Buzzy Linhart]]'s album ''Buzzy''.<ref>The Tapestry of Delights, Vernon Joynson \u2013 {{ISBN|1-899855-15-7}}</ref> They collaborated with [[Quincy Jones]] on the score of the movie ''[[Toy Grabbers]]'', some tracks of which appear on their second album ''In Fields of Ardath'' (1969) and they also appeared in the movie ''[[Connecting Rooms]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p17392/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography of Eyes of Blue by Bruce Eder] Retrieved 7 February 2010</ref>\n\nThrough producer Lou Reizner, Ryan began getting work as an arranger, and wrote the string arrangements on [[Caetano Veloso]]'s third self-titled album called either his ''[[Caetano Veloso (1971 album)|1971 album]]'' or ''A Little More Blue''.\n\nThe Eyes of Blue's third and final album, ''Bluebell Wood'', was released under the pseudonym Big Sleep, and the band broke up shortly afterwards.\n\nIn 1970 Ryan and Weathers joined [[Pete Brown & Piblokto!]] playing on one single, \"Flying Hero Sandwich\" / \"My Last Band\". When bassist Steve Glover broke his wrist, he was replaced by Michael \"Will\" Youatt,<ref name=\"CDNotes\">Sleeve notes by [[Michael Heatley]] to CD reissue of Black Hole Star/Tales From The Blue Cocoons</ref> and when Piblokto disbanded Ryan and Youatt, together with Clive John, who had just left [[Man (band)|Man]], formed the first incarnation of Iorworth Pritchard and the Neutrons.\n\n==Man==\nIn April 1972 Ryan and Youatt joined Man, Clive John re-joining at the same time.<ref>[http://www.nmw.com/artists/man~biography NME Biography of Man] Retrieved 1 February 2010</ref> The band recorded ''[[Be Good to Yourself at Least Once a Day]]'' which received good reviews.  A party on 19 December 1972, with [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]] and others, was issued as ''[[Christmas at the Patti]]'', a double 10\" album, which topped the \"budget\" album chart.  Man then recorded the double album ''[[Back into the Future]]'', half in the studio, and half live at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]].<ref>{{cite book| first= Vernon| last= Joynson| year= 2006| title= The Tapestry of Delights Revisited \u2013 Man| edition= 1st| publisher= Borderline productions| location= Telford| isbn= 1-899855-15-7| pages= 531\u2013532}}</ref> The album initially sold well, rising to No 23,<ref name=\"Chartstats\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Chart Stats for Man Albums] Retrieved 17 March 2009</ref> and was tipped to be album that would make the band, but pressing was restricted by a lack of plastic during the [[1973 oil crisis]].\n\n==Neutrons==\nRyan and Youatt left Man in 1973 to re-form the Neutrons. [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], head of [[A&R]] at United Artists put the duo in  [[Rockfield Studios]] where they began recording the first Neutrons album, ''Black Hole Star''. To record the album, Ryan and Youatt assembled several friends and former bandmates, including drummers [[John Weathers|John \"Pugwash\" Weathers]] (then with [[Gentle Giant]]) and [[Dave Charles]]; guitarists Martin Wallace and Ray \"Taff\" Williams, who had been in Eyes of Blue and Piblokto!, violinist Stuart Gordon (ex [[Incredible String Band]]) and vocalist Caromay Dixon.<ref name=\"dprp\">[http://www.dprp.net/forgotten/neutrons/index.html Dutch Progressive Rock Pages on Neutrons written by Nigel Camilleri] Retrieved 7 February 2010</ref>\n\nThe initial recordings were made at Rockfield Studios - \"Snow Covered Eyes\" and \"Living In The World Today\". The rest of the album was recorded in April 1974 at [[Chipping Norton Recording Studios]].  Released in September 1974 ''Black Hole Star'' featured Neutrons' logo, designed by [[Rick Griffin]], whilst the track \"Mermaid And Chips\" features the lyrics of Pete Brown.  The album spawned one single \"Dance of the Psychedelic Lounge Lizard\"/\"Suzy and the Wonder Boy\", The A-side being dedicated to [[Graham Bond]], whilst the B side was not on the album, although it features [[Dave Edmunds]] on slide guitar.<ref name=\"CDNotes\"/>\n\nThe second album ''Tales From The Blue Cocoons'' was released in April 1975.  The performers were similar to the first album, except Weathers was replaced by Stuart Halliday and Stuart Gordon did not play.\n\nRyan and Youatt were having musical differences, so, unlike the first album, none of the tracks on the second were jointly written by the pair, whilst the uncredited \"Welsh R Blunt\" dates from when Ryan was in Piblokto! and had also been played, but not recorded, by Man.\n\nNeutrons toured to promote the album, but Taff Williams left shortly after the start of the tour, so former [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]] guitarist Richard Treece stood in, but Neutrons had disbanded by July 1975.\n\n==Man again==\nRyan played on Clive John's solo album ''You Always Know Where You Stand With a Buzzard'', and briefly started a solo project ''Road of Cobras'', before rejoining [[Man (band)|Man]] in September 1975, along with bassist [[John McKenzie (musician)|John McKenzie]].  One of the ''Road of Cobras'' tracks \"Something is Happening\" ended up on the next Man album ''[[The Welsh Connection]]''<ref name=\"dprp\"/> which reached No 40 in the UK Album Chart.<ref name=\"Chartstats\"/> Towards the end of the US tour to promote the album, Man's manager, Barrie Marshall, announced that he would be discontinuing his role as the band's manager, and adopting all rights to the name Man. On the farewell tour of Europe, differences arose amongst the band who agreed to call it a day. The MCA record deal was for 3 albums, but MCA eventually agreed to a live farewell album, ''[[All's Well That Ends Well (Man album)|All's Well That Ends Well]]'' recorded at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] on 11\u201313 December, although the final gig was in Slough on 16 December 1976.\n\n==Pete Brown==\nAfter Man's breakup, Ryan started working with [[Pete Brown]] again and also toured with [[Gallagher and Lyle]], including a 1978 BBC \"In Concert\" session,<ref>Mannerisms II \"Man & roots/offshoots Information Booklet\" by Michael Mycock, P19</ref>\n\nRyan moved to Denmark in 1980, where he met and married the writer and director Bolette Bernild.<ref name =\"Guardianobit\">{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Pete|title=Phil Ryan obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/30/phil-ryan-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> In the 1980s he wrote the score for the BBC Play For To Day, ''Red Shift''. Although now living in Denmark, Ryan continued a productive songwriting partnership with Pete Brown, producing two Ryan/Brown albums, ''Ardours of the Lost Rake'' and ''Coals to Jerusalem''. They began touring in 1993, and a compilation of the two albums was issued on CD as ''The Land That Cream Forgot''.\nRyan worked as a musical director and composer for many of the top Danish Theaters, eventually becoming house composer for Comedievogen and the B&U department of Denmarks Radio (TV).

[[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], head of [[A&R]] at United Artists put the duo in  [[Rockfield Studios]] where they began recording the first Neutrons album, ''Black Hole Star''. To record the album, Ryan and Youatt assembled several friends and former bandmates, including drummers [[John Weathers|John \"Pugwash\" Weathers]] (then with [[Gentle Giant]]) and [[Dave Charles]]; guitarists Martin Wallace and Ray \"Taff\" Williams, who had been in Eyes of Blue and Piblokto!, violinist Stuart Gordon (ex [[Incredible String Band]]) and vocalist Caromay Dixon.<ref name=\"dprp\">[http://www.dprp.net/forgotten/neutrons/index.html Dutch Progressive Rock Pages on Neutrons written by Nigel Camilleri] Retrieved 7 February 2010</ref>\n\nThe initial recordings were made at Rockfield Studios - \"Snow Covered Eyes\" and \"Living In The World Today\". The rest of the album was recorded in April 1974 at [[Chipping Norton Recording Studios]].  Released in September 1974 ''Black Hole Star'' featured Neutrons' logo, designed by [[Rick Griffin]], whilst the track \"Mermaid And Chips\" features the lyrics of Pete Brown.  The album spawned one single \"Dance of the Psychedelic Lounge Lizard\"/\"Suzy and the Wonder Boy\", The A-side being dedicated to [[Graham Bond]], whilst the B side was not on the album, although it features [[Dave Edmunds]] on slide guitar.<ref name=\"CDNotes\"/>\n\nThe second album ''Tales From The Blue Cocoons'' was released in April 1975.  The performers were similar to the first album, except Weathers was replaced by Stuart Halliday and Stuart Gordon did not play.\n\nRyan and Youatt were having musical differences, so, unlike the first album, none of the tracks on the second were jointly written by the pair, whilst the uncredited \"Welsh R Blunt\" dates from when Ryan was in Piblokto! and had also been played, but not recorded, by Man.\n\nNeutrons toured to promote the album, but Taff Williams left shortly after the start of the tour, so former [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]] guitarist Richard Treece stood in, but Neutrons had disbanded by July 1975.\n\n==Man Again==\nRyan played on Clive John's solo album ''You Always Know Where You Stand With a Buzzard'', and briefly started a solo project ''Road of Cobras'', before rejoining [[Man (band)|Man]] in September 1975, along with bassist [[John McKenzie (musician)|John McKenzie]].  One of the ''Road of Cobras'' tracks \"Something is Happening\" ended up on the next Man album ''[[The Welsh Connection]]''<ref name=\"dprp\"/> which reached No 40 in the UK Album Chart.<ref name=\"Chartstats\"/> Towards the end of the US tour to promote the album, Man's manager, Barrie Marshall, announced that he would be discontinuing his role as the band's manager, and adopting all rights to the name Man. On the farewell tour of Europe, differences arose amongst the band who agreed to call it a day. The MCA record deal was for 3 albums, but MCA eventually agreed to a live farewell album, ''[[All's Well That Ends Well (Man album)|All's Well That Ends Well]]'' recorded at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] on 11\u201313 December, although the final gig was in Slough on 16 December 1976.\n\n==Pete Brown==\nAfter Man's breakup, Ryan started working with [[Pete Brown]] again and also toured with [[Gallagher and Lyle]], including a 1978 BBC \"In Concert\" session,<ref>Mannerisms II \"Man & roots/offshoots Information Booklet\" by Michael Mycock, P19</ref>\n\nRyan moved to Denmark in 1980, where he met and married the writer and director Bolette Bernild.<ref name =\"Guardianobit\">{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Pete|title=Phil Ryan obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/30/phil-ryan-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> In the 1980s he wrote the score for the BBC Play For To Day, ''Red Shift''. Although now living in Denmark, Ryan continued a productive songwriting partnership with Pete Brown, producing two Ryan/Brown albums, ''Ardours of the Lost Rake'' and ''Coals to Jerusalem''. They began touring in 1993, and a compilation of the two albums was issued on CD as ''The Land That Cream Forgot''.\nRyan worked as a musical director and composer for many of the top Danish Theaters, eventually becoming house composer for Comedievogen and the B&U department of Denmarks Radio (TV).

The author brings together multigenerational knowledge and practices to \"counter the idea that [[aborigine| aboriginal]] [[innovation]] is primitive and exists isolated from [[technology]]. \" TEK is the acronym for \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\".\n\n==Many definitions==\n===Binary definition===\nAccording to the ''Cambridge International Dictionary of English'', the concept of low-tech is simply defined as a technique that is not recent, or using old [[material]]s <ref name=\"dico\"/>. Companies that are considered ''low-tech'' have a simple operation. The less sophisticated an object, the more low-tech.  They are sometimes even assimilated to [[archaic]] methods. This definition does not take into account the [[ecological]] or [[social]] aspect, as it is only based on a simplistic definition of low-tech philosophy. The low-techs would then be seen as a \"step backwards\", and not as possible [[innovation]].\n\nAlso, with this definition, the \"[[high-tech]]\" (ex: the [[telegraph]]) of a certain era becomes the \"low-tech\" of the one after (ex: compared to the [[telephone]]).\n\n===Technocriticists===\n{{main|Technocriticism}}\nLow-tech is sometimes described as an \"anti [[high-tech]]\" movement, as a deliberate renunciation of a complicated and expensive [[technology]]. This kind of protest [[Social_movement|movement]] criticizes any disproportionate [[technology]]: a comparison with the [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddic]] or [[Technocriticism| technocritical]] [[Social_movement|movement]]s, which appeared since the [[Industrial Revolution]], is then possible. This critical part of the ''low-tech'' movement can be called \"no-tech\", see for instance \"[https://www.notechmagazine.com/2016/07/no-tech-reader-7.html No-tech magazine]\".\n\n===Recently: a wider and more balanced approach===\nA second, more nuanced definition of low-tech may appear. This definition takes into account the [[philosophy| philosophical]], [[eco-friendly|environmental]] and [[social]] aspects. Low-tech are no longer restricted to old [[technique]]s, but also extended to new, future-oriented techniques, more [[eco-friendly |ecological]] and intended to recreate [[social]] bounds. A low-tech innovation is then possible <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nContrary to the first definition, this one is much more [[optimistic]] and has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/positive#Adjective positive] connotation. It would then oppose the [[planned obsolescence]] of objects (often \u201c[[high-tech]]\u201d) and question the [[consumer society]], as well as the [[materialist]] principles underneath. With this definition, the concept of ''low-tech'' thus implies that anyone could make objects using their intelligence, and share their [[know-how]] to popularize their creations. A low-tech must therefore be [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accessible#Adjective accessible] to all, and could therefore help in reduction of [[Economic_inequality| inequalities]] <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nFurthermore, some reduce the definition of low-tech to meet basic needs (eating, drinking, housing, heating ...), which disqualifies many technologies from the definition of low-techs, but this definition does not is not always accepted <ref name=\"GrimaudTastevin2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimaud|first1=Emmanuel|last2=Tastevin|first2=Yann Philippe|last3=Vidal|first3=Denis|journal=Techniques & culture|language=french|issue=67|year=2017|title=Low-tech ?

The author brings together multigenerational knowledge and practices to \"counter the idea that [[aborigine| aboriginal]] [[innovation]] is primitive and exists isolated from [[technology]]. \" TEK is the acronym for \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\".\n\n==Many definitions==\n===Binary definition===\nAccording to the ''Cambridge International Dictionary of English'', the concept of low-tech is simply defined as a technique that is not recent, or using old [[material]]s <ref name=\"dico\"/>. Companies that are considered ''low-tech'' have a simple operation. The less sophisticated an object, the more low-tech.  They are sometimes even assimilated to [[archaic]] methods. This definition does not take into account the [[ecological]] or [[social]] aspect, as it is only based on a simplistic definition of low-tech philosophy. The low-techs would then be seen as a \"step backwards\", and not as possible [[innovation]].\n\nAlso, with this definition, the \"[[high-tech]]\" (ex: the [[telegraph]]) of a certain era becomes the \"low-tech\" of the one after (ex: compared to the [[telephone]]).\n\n===Technocriticists===\n{{main|Technocriticism}}\nLow-tech is sometimes described as an \"anti [[high-tech]]\" movement, as a deliberate renunciation of a complicated and expensive [[technology]]. This kind of protest [[Social_movement|movement]] criticizes any disproportionate [[technology]]: a comparison with the [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddic]] or [[Technocriticism| technocritical]] [[Social_movement|movement]]s, which appeared since the [[Industrial Revolution]], is then possible. This critical part of the ''low-tech'' movement can be called \"no-tech\", see for instance \"[https://www.notechmagazine.com/2016/07/no-tech-reader-7.html No-tech magazine]\".\n\n===Recently: a wider and more balanced approach===\nA second, more nuanced definition of low-tech may appear. This definition takes into account the [[philosophy| philosophical]], [[eco-friendly|environmental]] and [[social]] aspects. Low-tech are no longer restricted to old [[technique]]s, but also extended to new, future-oriented techniques, more [[eco-friendly |ecological]] and intended to recreate [[social]] bounds. A low-tech innovation is then possible <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nContrary to the first definition, this one is much more [[optimistic]] and has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/positive#Adjective positive] connotation. It would then oppose the [[planned obsolescence]] of objects (often \u201c[[high-tech]]\u201d) and question the [[consumer society]], as well as the [[materialist]] principles underneath. With this definition, the concept of ''low-tech'' thus implies that anyone could make objects using their intelligence, and share their [[know-how]] to popularize their creations. A low-tech must therefore be [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accessible#Adjective accessible] to all, and could therefore help in reduction of [[Economic_inequality| inequalities]] <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nFurthermore, some reduce the definition of low-tech to meet basic needs (eating, drinking, housing, heating ...), which disqualifies many technologies from the definition of low-techs, but this definition does not is not always accepted <ref name=\"GrimaudTastevin2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimaud|first1=Emmanuel|last2=Tastevin|first2=Yann Philippe|last3=Vidal|first3=Denis|journal=Techniques & culture|language=french|issue=67|year=2017|title=Low-tech ?

Nowhere near as insensible to Hip-hop/R&B as dark proggers tend to be, but note that very few female artists crack his top 10s, which in 2018 was really missing the action.

Nowhere near as insensible to Hip-hop/R&B as dark proggers tend to be, but note that very few female artists crack his top 10s, which in 2018 was really missing the action.
