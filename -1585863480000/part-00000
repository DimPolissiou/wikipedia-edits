[[Delmer Daves]] directed the movie, which stars [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] and [[Dorothy McGuire]] as the middle-aged lovers, and [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Sandra Dee]] as their respective children.

The inn was previously Bart's elegant family mansion in an exclusive resort, but as his family fortunes have dwindled, the Hunters are forced to rent rooms to paying guests. Bart receives a reservation request from an old acquaintance, Ken Jorgenson ([[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]]), who was a lowly [[lifeguard]] on the island twenty years ago, but is now a successful research [[chemist]] and millionaire. Ken wants to bring his wife and daughter to the island for the summer. Bart suggests that Ken is just coming to lord his new wealth over Bart, who is no longer rich. Bart wants to refuse the reservation, but Sylvia insists that he accept because they badly need the money, even going so far as to move themselves into the small guest house so their own master bedroom suite can be rented to Ken and his family.\n\nKen arrives with his wife Helen ([[Constance Ford]]) and teenage daughter Molly ([[Sandra Dee]]). Helen and Ken have an unhappy marriage, sleep in separate bedrooms, and frequently argue, including over proper behavior standards for their daughter. Helen is a prude who disapproves of Molly's developing figure and healthy interest in boys, particularly Johnny Hunter, who is also attracted to Molly. Ken is much more relaxed and permissive, and tells his daughter that her natural desires are not shameful. Helen also tries, unsuccessfully, to put on airs and impress the upper class residents of the island, while Ken is not interested in pretense and is even happy to talk with older people who remember him from when he worked as a lifeguard.\n\nAs it turns out, Ken and Sylvia were lovers twenty years ago, when they were teenagers. It soon becomes apparent that they still love each other and have missed each other for many years, and that Ken returned to Pine Island in hopes of seeing Sylvia again. They had broken up because Ken was a poor college student, while Bart was the son of a rich established family, so Sylvia married Bart, and Ken, after seeing Sylvia's wedding announcement in the newspaper, married Helen. Both marriages were unhappy but Ken and Sylvia stayed in them because of their love for their respective children, Molly and Johnny. Ken and Sylvia find themselves drawn to each other again and begin secretly meeting every night. They are soon spotted by the island's night watchman, who informs Helen. Helen initially keeps quiet, on her mother's advice, planning to catch them in the act in order to ensure a large divorce settlement.\n\nKen goes on a business trip for a weekend, during which time Molly and Johnny, with Ken's permission, go sailing around the island. Their boat capsizes in rough water, stranding them on the beach overnight. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] rescues them the next day, but Helen is suspicious that the teenagers were intimate on the beach although they deny it. Helen sends for a doctor to forcibly examine Molly to make sure she is still a virgin, finding she is. Horrified, Molly runs away and sees Johnny, who threatens to kill Helen if she hurts Molly ever again. Helen contacts law enforcement and then in a fit of anger reveals Sylvia and Ken's affair in front of Bart, Ken, Sylvia and Johnny. Bart reveals he's long known about Sylvia's love for Ken and offers to forgive her, but she cannot go back. The Hunters and Jorgensons each go through an acrimonious public divorce, and Molly and Johnny are sent to boarding schools several states apart. Molly and Johnny are angry at Ken and Sylvia and stop speaking to them, becoming increasingly dependent on each other for emotional support despite Helen's constant interference and criticism of Molly's morals.\n\nKen and Sylvia eventually marry and move into a beach house. They talk Molly and Johnny into visiting them there, to which the teenagers agree largely because it will give them a chance to be together away from Helen, who is unable to prevent the visit due to a court order. During their visit, Molly and Johnny secretly consummate their love. Ken and Sylvia suspect that the teenagers are sleeping together and are concerned about the possible ill effects, but in view of their own past teenage history, feel they cannot order Molly and Johnny to stop loving each other. Soon after, Molly discovers she is pregnant, and she and Johnny run away together planning to get married. They seek Bart's blessing, but he is about to be admitted to the veterans' hospital due to ulcers from his drinking, and drunkenly tries to talk them out of marriage, later calling Helen to let her know what happened. The local [[justice of the peace]] sees they are under legal age to marry, and turns them down. In desperation, Molly and Johnny go to the house of Ken and Sylvia, who are supportive. In the end, a happy Johnny and Molly, just married, return to Pine Island for their honeymoon.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as Ken Jorgenson\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Sylvia Hunter\n* [[Sandra Dee]] as Molly Jorgenson\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Bart Hunter\n* [[Troy Donahue]] as Johnny Hunter\n* [[Constance Ford]] as Helen Jorgenson\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Mrs. Emily Hamilton Hamble\n* Jack Richardson as Claude Andrews\n* Martin Eric as Todd Harper\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and around the [[Monterey Peninsula]].<ref name=\"new\" /> Sloan Wilson wrote the first screenplay, which covered the 22-year span of the novel. Delmer Daves focused the new draft on one year. Daves said:\n<blockquote style=\"font-size:100%\">I have two kids who are just about the same age of these two in ''A Summer Place'' and I know how difficult communication between generations can be. And while this may sound corny, it can be assisted by love and understanding. Amid some rather tempestuous social activities, this is what we are trying to demonstrate. That there are two affairs may sound sensational, but that's not the point. We have received the approval of the Johnstone office, because the intent of the picture is a moral one. Frankness and impatience will help pull the cork on a situation blocked by intolerance. What we are trying to do is dramatise that pulling of the cork.<ref name=\"new\">'A Summer Place' on the California Coast, by Paine Knickerbocker, San Francisco. ''The New York Times'' (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 05 Apr 1959: X7.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome exterior and interior scenes involving Ken and Sylvia's beach house were filmed at [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Frank Lloyd Wright's]] [[List of Frank Lloyd Wright works|Clinton Walker House]], built in 1948. In the film, Sylvia tells Molly that Wright designed the house, ostensibly located on the East Coast near the movie's \"Pine Island\" location (since Molly and Johnny drive from Pine Island to the house after being sent away by the justice of the peace). In reality, Walker House is located on the beach side of Scenic Road on [[Monterey Bay]] in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]. The real house has only one level, although in the movie, the house is depicted as if it has a lower level at the same level as the beach. Additional scenes were filmed at the Honeymoon Cottage located at Mission Ranch in Carmel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-15/travel/9609150155_1_cottages-barn-tennis-courts |title= Eastwood Style: Clint's Resort Will Make Your Days (and Nights) California Carefree|publisher= Chicago Tribune|date= 5 Sep 1996|author=Susanne Hopkins|access-date= 30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe movie became popular after its release but had a mixed critical reception.

In 1960, the Percy Faith version reached Number One on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for nine consecutive weeks, a record at that time.<ref name=bronson /> The theme has been covered in instrumental or vocal versions by numerous other artists, including [[The Lettermen]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Julie London]], [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Joanie Sommers]] and [[The Ventures]], and has been featured in many other films and television programs.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 1971 film ''[[The Omega Man]]'', the lead character Robert Neville played by [[Charlton Heston]], listens to the film soundtrack main theme in his car on an [[8-track tape]] cartridge during the pre-credit opening sequence.\n\nThe lyrics of the song \"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" from the musical Grease are in part specifically about the events in this movie. \n\nThe film is part of a plot point in the [[Barry Levinson]] 1982 film ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]].''

[[Delmer Daves]] directed the movie, which stars [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] and [[Dorothy McGuire]] as the middle-aged lovers, and [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Sandra Dee]] as their respective children. The film contains a [[Theme from A Summer Place|memorable instrumental theme]] composed by [[Max Steiner]], which spent nine weeks at #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in 1960.<ref name=bronson>{{cite book |last=Bronson |first=Fred |date=1 October 2003 |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&pg=PT75#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Billboard Books |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2 |page=75}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAlcoholic Bart Hunter ([[Arthur Kennedy]]), his long-suffering wife Sylvia ([[Dorothy McGuire]]), and their teenage son Johnny ([[Troy Donahue]]) operate a crumbling inn on Pine Island off the [[Maine]] coast. The inn was previously Bart's elegant family mansion in an exclusive resort, but as his family fortunes have dwindled, the Hunters are forced to rent rooms to paying guests. Bart receives a reservation request from an old acquaintance, Ken Jorgenson ([[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]]), who was a lowly [[lifeguard]] on the island twenty years ago, but is now a successful research [[chemist]] and millionaire. Ken wants to bring his wife and daughter to the island for the summer. Bart suggests that Ken is just coming to lord his new wealth over Bart, who is no longer rich. Bart wants to refuse the reservation, but Sylvia insists that he accept because they badly need the money, even going so far as to move themselves into the small guest house so their own master bedroom suite can be rented to Ken and his family.\n\nKen arrives with his wife Helen ([[Constance Ford]]) and teenage daughter Molly ([[Sandra Dee]]). Helen and Ken have an unhappy marriage, sleep in separate bedrooms, and frequently argue, including over proper behavior standards for their daughter. Helen is a prude who disapproves of Molly's developing figure and healthy interest in boys, particularly Johnny Hunter, who is also attracted to Molly. Ken is much more relaxed and permissive, and tells his daughter that her natural desires are not shameful. Helen also tries, unsuccessfully, to put on airs and impress the upper class residents of the island, while Ken is not interested in pretense and is even happy to talk with older people who remember him from when he worked as a lifeguard.\n\nAs it turns out, Ken and Sylvia were lovers twenty years ago, when they were teenagers. It soon becomes apparent that they still love each other and have missed each other for many years, and that Ken returned to Pine Island in hopes of seeing Sylvia again. They had broken up because Ken was a poor college student, while Bart was the son of a rich established family, so Sylvia married Bart, and Ken, after seeing Sylvia's wedding announcement in the newspaper, married Helen. Both marriages were unhappy but Ken and Sylvia stayed in them because of their love for their respective children, Molly and Johnny. Ken and Sylvia find themselves drawn to each other again and begin secretly meeting every night. They are soon spotted by the island's night watchman, who informs Helen. Helen initially keeps quiet, on her mother's advice, planning to catch them in the act in order to ensure a large divorce settlement.\n\nKen goes on a business trip for a weekend, during which time Molly and Johnny, with Ken's permission, go sailing around the island. Their boat capsizes in rough water, stranding them on the beach overnight. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] rescues them the next day, but Helen is suspicious that the teenagers were intimate on the beach although they deny it. Helen sends for a doctor to forcibly examine Molly to make sure she is still a virgin, finding she is. Horrified, Molly runs away and sees Johnny, who threatens to kill Helen if she hurts Molly ever again. Helen contacts law enforcement and then in a fit of anger reveals Sylvia and Ken's affair in front of Bart, Ken, Sylvia and Johnny. Bart reveals he's long known about Sylvia's love for Ken and offers to forgive her, but she cannot go back. The Hunters and Jorgensons each go through an acrimonious public divorce, and Molly and Johnny are sent to boarding schools several states apart. Molly and Johnny are angry at Ken and Sylvia and stop speaking to them, becoming increasingly dependent on each other for emotional support despite Helen's constant interference and criticism of Molly's morals.\n\nKen and Sylvia eventually marry and move into a beach house. They talk Molly and Johnny into visiting them there, to which the teenagers agree largely because it will give them a chance to be together away from Helen, who is unable to prevent the visit due to a court order. During their visit, Molly and Johnny secretly consummate their love. Ken and Sylvia suspect that the teenagers are sleeping together and are concerned about the possible ill effects, but in view of their own past teenage history, feel they cannot order Molly and Johnny to stop loving each other. Soon after, Molly discovers she is pregnant, and she and Johnny run away together planning to get married. They seek Bart's blessing, but he is about to be admitted to the veterans' hospital due to ulcers from his drinking, and drunkenly tries to talk them out of marriage, later calling Helen to let her know what happened. The local [[justice of the peace]] sees they are under legal age to marry, and turns them down. In desperation, Molly and Johnny go to the house of Ken and Sylvia, who are supportive. In the end, a happy Johnny and Molly, just married, return to Pine Island for their honeymoon.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as Ken Jorgenson\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Sylvia Hunter\n* [[Sandra Dee]] as Molly Jorgenson\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Bart Hunter\n* [[Troy Donahue]] as Johnny Hunter\n* [[Constance Ford]] as Helen Jorgenson\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Mrs. Emily Hamilton Hamble\n* Jack Richardson as Claude Andrews\n* Martin Eric as Todd Harper\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and around the [[Monterey Peninsula]].<ref name=\"new\" /> Sloan Wilson wrote the first screenplay, which covered the 22-year span of the novel. Delmer Daves focused the new draft on one year. Daves said:\n<blockquote style=\"font-size:100%\">I have two kids who are just about the same age of these two in ''A Summer Place'' and I know how difficult communication between generations can be. And while this may sound corny, it can be assisted by love and understanding. Amid some rather tempestuous social activities, this is what we are trying to demonstrate. That there are two affairs may sound sensational, but that's not the point. We have received the approval of the Johnstone office, because the intent of the picture is a moral one. Frankness and impatience will help pull the cork on a situation blocked by intolerance.

In the film, Sylvia tells Molly that Wright designed the house, ostensibly located on the East Coast near the movie's \"Pine Island\" location (since Molly and Johnny drive from Pine Island to the house after being sent away by the justice of the peace). In reality, Walker House is located on the beach side of Scenic Road on [[Monterey Bay]] in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]. The real house has only one level, although in the movie, the house is depicted as if it has a lower level at the same level as the beach.

When he falls into a coma during minor surgery to remove a nonmalignant mole on his neck, Julie learns from his doctor, Dr. Timmy Spector, that another surgeon nicked his artery, necessitating a [[blood transfusion]] to which he had a rare allergic reaction. The following day, Julie is told Richard has overcome the reaction, but his liver has sustained serious damage requiring immediate treatment. In quick succession, all his organs begin to fail.\n\nWhile trying to comfort Julie, family friend Cal Whiting reveals his girlfriend Miranda has confessed to having had a lengthy affair with Richard. Distressed by the news, Julie seeks advice from her egocentric mother but finds herself unable to discuss her husband's infidelity. She decides to confront Miranda and asks her what future she anticipated having with her husband. Miranda confesses she and Richard are deeply in love and have discussed marriage, although thus far she has been unable to make such a permanent commitment.\n\nJulie begins to unravel emotionally. She visits Cal, whose attempted seduction of her fails due to [[impotence]]. At the hospital, she tells the unconscious Richard she will never divorce him and vows to ruin his reputation. Timmy invites her to his apartment for drinks and admits he was aware of Richard's affair not only with Miranda, but with other women as well, and kept them secret out of a sense of loyalty to his friend. Stunned and confused, Julie lashes out at Timmy, then seduces him, and he succumbs to her advances.\n\nAt home later that evening, Julie finds a black book in Richard's desk and realizes it contains coded data about his numerous extramarital affairs, many of them with her friends. She gives it to Cal, who then shows it to Miranda to prove she was just one of Richard's many conquests. The following day, Richard goes into cardiac arrest, and Julie realizes she wants him to survive despite his betrayal of her. When Timmy reports her husband has died, a grieving Julie takes her sons for a walk in Central Park to contemplate their future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Julie Messinger \n* [[James Coco]] as Dr. Timmy Spector \n* [[Jennifer O'Neill]] as Miranda Graham \n* [[Ken Howard]] as Cal Whiting \n* [[Nina Foch]] as Mrs. Wallman \n* [[Laurence Luckinbill]] as Richard Messinger \n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Marcy Berns \n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Bernard Kalman \n* [[Sam Levene]] as Uncle Eddie \n* [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] as Barney Halsted \n* [[James Beard]] as Dr. Mahler\n* [[Rita Gam]] as Doria \n* [[Elaine Joyce]] as Marian Spector \n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mrs. Gold \n* [[Virginia Vestoff]] as Emily Lapham\n* Oscar Grossman as the doorman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThrough his son [[Erik Lee Preminger|Erik]], who was working as his story editor, producer [[Otto Preminger]] heard about a manuscript by [[Lois Gould]] that was rumored to be a hot property. He negotiated with the author and purchased the film rights for $200,000 in February 1970, three months before the book was published.<ref>Fujiwara, Chris, ''The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger''. New York: Macmillan Publishers 2009. {{ISBN|0-86547-995-X}}, p. 385</ref>\n\nThe novel, narrated in [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] mode by Julie Messinger, proved to be difficult to adapt for the screen. [[Joan Micklin Silver]] initially tackled the project, but Preminger found her to be too much of a [[Feminism|feminist]] who was more psychologically attuned to the character than he thought was necessary. He then hired [[Joan Didion]] and [[John Gregory Dunne]] and worked with them for several months. Finally, in early 1971, [[Elaine May]], his original choice for screenwriter, became available. May worked on the script for ten weeks, although Preminger found it difficult to adjust to her method of writing. The two would meet for a story conference, then May would disappear and remain incommunicado for two weeks or so, finally emerging with a substantial part of the screenplay completed. Preminger would give her notes and she would disappear again, and this routine continued until the script was finished. Not wanting her name attached to work started by others, May insisted she did not want screen credit and used the pseudonym [[Esther Dale]], the name of a Hollywood character actress, instead of her own. Preminger later used May's involvement in the film to help promote it, a move the screenwriter resented, as she felt he was \"more honorable than that.\"<ref>''The World and Its Double'', pp. 385-86</ref>\n\nPreminger and leading lady [[Dyan Cannon]] clashed throughout filming. She was constantly late, one of the director's pet peeves, and the two disagreed about everything about her character, from how she should be portrayed to how she should be dressed. Uncomfortable with the director's perception of Julie, the actress frequently tried to incorporate some of her own vision into her interpretation, resulting in loud on-set arguments that left Cannon feeling alone, self-conscious, and very vulnerable. Upon the film's completion, the two vowed never to work with each other again.<ref>''The World and Its Double'', pp. 388-95</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film earned mixed reviews at the time of its release, with some feeling it was better than the failed films Preminger did between 1965\u201370. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film \"a hard, unsentimental, deeply cynical comedy\" and \"Preminger's best film in a long time, probably since ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' in 1959.\" He added, \"There are funny lines in the movie, but they are rarely allowed to be merely funny; they are also intended to hurt. People hurt and insult one another because, we sense, attack is the best form of defense inside this carnivorous society. Some of the dialog is in appallingly bad taste, and some of the critics have blamed the bad taste on Preminger, but it would have taken a lesser director to leave it out. The vulgarity belongs there because the movie is as tough as the people it's about.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720117/REVIEWS/201170301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said, \"The whole notion is so outrageously [[melodrama]]tic that Preminger was probably right in choosing to play it for comedy . . . On second thought, ''Such Good Friends'' might have worked better the other way. Preminger is usually funnier \u2014 remember ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]''? \u2014 when he's trying to be serious.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877585,00.html ''Time'' review]</ref>\n\nTony Mastroianni of the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' called it \"one of those sick-funny films that asks you to laugh at tragedy and gets away with it.\" He continued, \"It undoubtedly will offend many and for a number of reasons. It has a brand of caustic wit that somehow surmounts situations that are a blend of soap opera maudlin and ribald coarseness. The picture takes on such institutions as marriage, medicine and friendship and treats them all pretty roughly. What succeeds is a barrage of bright, witty, trenchant lines written by Elaine May operating under the pseudonym of Esther Dale. Director Otto Preminger, whose recent films looked as though they were directed by an ax murderer, does a better job this time out. There are still scenes that are all surface, some that are just crudely done. But in others, notably those involving large groups of people, he works out an interplay of parts that results in fascinating moments of counterpoint.\"<ref>[http://www.clevelandmemory.org/mastroianni/tm546.shtml ''Cleveland Press'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out London]]'' observed, \"Sadly, Preminger seems unsure whether to take May's characters at face value or to feel for them. As a result, the cardboard emotions of Cannon . . . and Coco . . . are too often taken for real, and the script's brilliantly witty [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] are shunted too quickly out of sight.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/75555/Such_Good_Friends.html ''Time Out London'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film one star, saying it \"aimed at being contemporary but turned out contemptible.

When he falls into a coma during minor surgery to remove a nonmalignant mole on his neck, Julie learns from his doctor, Dr. Timmy Spector, that another surgeon nicked his artery, necessitating a [[blood transfusion]] to which he had a rare allergic reaction. The following day, Julie is told Richard has overcome the reaction, but his liver has sustained serious damage requiring immediate treatment. In quick succession, all his organs begin to fail.\n\nWhile trying to comfort Julie, family friend Cal Whiting reveals his girlfriend Miranda has confessed to having had a lengthy affair with Richard. Distressed by the news, Julie seeks advice from her egocentric mother but finds herself unable to discuss her husband's infidelity. She decides to confront Miranda and asks her what future she anticipated having with her husband. Miranda confesses she and Richard are deeply in love and have discussed marriage, although thus far she has been unable to make such a permanent commitment.\n\nJulie begins to unravel emotionally. She visits Cal, whose attempted seduction of her fails due to [[impotence]]. At the hospital, she tells the unconscious Richard she will never divorce him and vows to ruin his reputation. Timmy invites her to his apartment for drinks and admits he was aware of Richard's affair not only with Miranda, but with other women as well, and kept them secret out of a sense of loyalty to his friend. Stunned and confused, Julie lashes out at Timmy, then seduces him, and he succumbs to her advances.\n\nAt home later that evening, Julie finds a black book in Richard's desk and realizes it contains coded data about his numerous extramarital affairs, many of them with her friends. She gives it to Cal, who then shows it to Miranda to prove she was just one of Richard's many conquests. The following day, Richard goes into cardiac arrest, and Julie realizes she wants him to survive despite his betrayal of her. When Timmy reports her husband has died, a grieving Julie takes her sons for a walk in Central Park to contemplate their future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Julie Messinger \n* [[James Coco]] as Dr. Timmy Spector \n* [[Jennifer O'Neill]] as Miranda Graham \n* [[Ken Howard]] as Cal Whiting \n* [[Nina Foch]] as Mrs. Wallman \n* [[Laurence Luckinbill]] as Richard Messinger \n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Marcy Berns \n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Bernard Kalman \n* [[Sam Levene]] as Uncle Eddie \n* [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] as Barney Halsted \n* [[James Beard]] as Dr. Mahler\n* [[Rita Gam]] as Doria \n* [[Elaine Joyce]] as Marian Spector \n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mrs. Gold \n* [[Virginia Vestoff]] as Emily Lapham\n* Oscar Grossman as the doorman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThrough his son [[Erik Lee Preminger|Erik]], who was working as his story editor, producer [[Otto Preminger]] heard about a manuscript by [[Lois Gould]] that was rumored to be a hot property. He negotiated with the author and purchased the film rights for $200,000 in February 1970, three months before the book was published.<ref>Fujiwara, Chris, ''The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger''. New York: Macmillan Publishers 2009. {{ISBN|0-86547-995-X}}, p. 385</ref>\n\nThe novel, narrated in [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] mode by Julie Messinger, proved to be difficult to adapt for the screen. [[Joan Micklin Silver]] initially tackled the project, but Preminger found her to be too much of a [[Feminism|feminist]] who was more psychologically attuned to the character than he thought was necessary. He then hired [[Joan Didion]] and [[John Gregory Dunne]] and worked with them for several months. Finally, in early 1971, [[Elaine May]], his original choice for screenwriter, became available. May worked on the script for ten weeks, although Preminger found it difficult to adjust to her method of writing. The two would meet for a story conference, then May would disappear and remain incommunicado for two weeks or so, finally emerging with a substantial part of the screenplay completed. Preminger would give her notes and she would disappear again, and this routine continued until the script was finished. Not wanting her name attached to work started by others, May insisted she did not want screen credit and used the pseudonym [[Esther Dale]], the name of a Hollywood character actress, instead of her own. Preminger later used May's involvement in the film to help promote it, a move the screenwriter resented, as she felt he was \"more honorable than that.\"<ref>''The World and Its Double'', pp. 385-86</ref>\n\nPreminger and leading lady [[Dyan Cannon]] clashed throughout filming. She was constantly late, one of the director's pet peeves, and the two disagreed about everything about her character, from how she should be portrayed to how she should be dressed. Uncomfortable with the director's perception of Julie, the actress frequently tried to incorporate some of her own vision into her interpretation, resulting in loud on-set arguments that left Cannon feeling alone, self-conscious, and very vulnerable. Upon the film's completion, the two vowed never to work with each other again.<ref>''The World and Its Double'', pp. 388-95</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film earned mixed reviews at the time of its release, with some feeling it was better than the failed films Preminger did between 1965-70. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film \"a hard, unsentimental, deeply cynical comedy\" and \"Preminger's best film in a long time, probably since ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' in 1959.\" He added, \"There are funny lines in the movie, but they are rarely allowed to be merely funny; they are also intended to hurt. People hurt and insult one another because, we sense, attack is the best form of defense inside this carnivorous society. Some of the dialog is in appallingly bad taste, and some of the critics have blamed the bad taste on Preminger, but it would have taken a lesser director to leave it out. The vulgarity belongs there because the movie is as tough as the people it's about.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720117/REVIEWS/201170301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said, \"The whole notion is so outrageously [[melodrama]]tic that Preminger was probably right in choosing to play it for comedy . . . On second thought, ''Such Good Friends'' might have worked better the other way. Preminger is usually funnier \u2014 remember ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]''? \u2014 when he's trying to be serious.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877585,00.html ''Time'' review]</ref>\n\nTony Mastroianni of the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' called it \"one of those sick-funny films that asks you to laugh at tragedy and gets away with it.\" He continued, \"It undoubtedly will offend many and for a number of reasons. It has a brand of caustic wit that somehow surmounts situations that are a blend of soap opera maudlin and ribald coarseness. The picture takes on such institutions as marriage, medicine and friendship and treats them all pretty roughly. What succeeds is a barrage of bright, witty, trenchant lines written by Elaine May operating under the pseudonym of Esther Dale. Director Otto Preminger, whose recent films looked as though they were directed by an ax murderer, does a better job this time out. There are still scenes that are all surface, some that are just crudely done. But in others, notably those involving large groups of people, he works out an interplay of parts that results in fascinating moments of counterpoint.\"<ref>[http://www.clevelandmemory.org/mastroianni/tm546.shtml ''Cleveland Press'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out London]]'' observed, \"Sadly, Preminger seems unsure whether to take May's characters at face value or to feel for them. As a result, the cardboard emotions of Cannon . . . and Coco . . . are too often taken for real, and the script's brilliantly witty [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] are shunted too quickly out of sight.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/75555/Such_Good_Friends.html ''Time Out London'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film one star, saying it \"aimed at being contemporary but turned out contemptible. It does, however, provide a look at a tough-skinned New York lifestyle that Big Apple resident Preminger well understood.\"<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/good-friends/review/119355 ''TV Guide'' review]</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nCannon was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]].

The film's plot follows a group of adults, responsible for a prank gone wrong on [[April Fool's Day]], who are invited to a reunion at their defunct high school, where a masked killer awaits inside.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school outcast Marty Rantzen is seduced by popular girl Carol in the women's locker room. This is revealed as a prank as several students appear and mock Marty's naked body. Led by troublemaker Skip, the students physically abuse Marty before the coach intervenes. Later, two of the students feign remorse and offer Marty marijuana laced with something to make him sick. Skip messes with Marty's science project, accidentally setting off a chain of events that ends with Marty being doused with [[nitric acid]], disfiguring him.\n\nTen years later Carol meets Skip and the others at their high school reunion.

Skip is hanged by a noose but escapes.\n\nThe jester chases Carol throughout the school, and in her panic she accidentally kills Skip with an axe to the face. Finally the jester kills Carol with a javelin in the locker room where the initial prank took place. Removing his mask, the jester is revealed as Marty, who revels in his revenge before he hallucinates and gets attacked by the spirits of the people he just slaughtered and passes out. \n\nAfter the massacre, Marty wakes up in the hospital. A doctor remarks that Marty's [[skin grafting]] has been a success.

It stars [[Albert Finney]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Karen Allen]], [[Peter Weller]] and [[Dana Hill]]. Set in [[Marin County, California]], the film follows George (Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Keaton), whose deteriorating marriage, separation and love affairs devastate their four children. The title of the film alludes to the move of \"[[Hearts (card game)#Shooting the moon|shooting the moon]]\" in the card game [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\nGoldman began writing the script in 1971, deriving inspiration from his encounters with [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional couples]]. He spent several years trying to secure a major film studio to produce it before taking it to [[20th Century Fox]]. Parker learned of the script as he was developing ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), and he later worked with Goldman to rewrite it. After an unsuccessful pre-production development at Fox, Parker moved the project to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which provided a budget of $12 million. [[Principal photography]] lasted 62 days, in the period from January to April 1981, on location in Marin County.\n\n''Shoot the Moon'' premiered on February 19, 1982 to mostly positive reviews, but was deemed a [[box office bomb|box-office failure]], having grossed only $9.2 million in North America. It later competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]], and received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] (Finney) and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress \u2013 Drama]] (Keaton).\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Marin County, California]], writer George Dunlap and his wife Faith are an unhappy couple who live with their daughters Sherry, Jill, Marianne and Molly in a farmhouse that George has refurbished.  George is preparing to attend an awards banquet in his honor, when he receives a phone call from Sandy, a single mother with whom he has begun an affair.  Sherry, the oldest of the four children, picks up the phone and listens in on the conversation.  \n\nAfter the kids leave for school the next morning, Faith expresses her suspicions of the affair, prompting George to leave and move into his beach house.  Sherry refuses to speak to George, while her sisters visit George on weekends.  Jill, Marianne and Molly also meet Sandy, who harbors cynicism towards them and views them as a distraction in her sexual affair with George.\n\nFaith falls into depression, but is elated when she begins a relationship with Frank Henderson, a contractor she has hired to build a tennis court on the grove of the farmhouse.  One day, George visits the farmhouse, aggressively requesting to Faith that he be able to give Sherry her birthday present, a typewriter.  George grows frustrated upon meeting Frank and seeing the construction work being done to the yard.  George returns to the home later that night, again demanding that he be able to give Sherry her present.  When Faith refuses to let him in, George breaks the door apart, pushes her out of the house, and blocks the entrance door with a chair. After Sherry refuses the gift, George spanks her repeatedly.  The other children try to fight him off, but George does not relent until after Sherry threatens him with a pair of scissors.  After letting herself back into the house, Faith comforts a sobbing Sherry, and George leaves ashamed.\n\nGeorge and Faith go to court to begin the first stage of their divorce proceedings, which involves joint custody of the children.  After the court hearing, Faith tells George that her father has been hospitalized.  At the hospital, they both downplay the disintegration of their marriage, but Faith's father senses that they are lying, and dies shortly thereafter. \n\nAfter the funeral, George finds Faith having dinner at a restaurant and joins her.  They have a heated, passionate exchange, arguing about their relationship before getting drunk. They go to a hotel room where Faith and the children are staying, and have sex.  After Sherry enters Faith's bedroom and finds them lying in bed, Faith asks George to leave.\n\nWhen the tennis court is completed, Faith and Frank throw an outdoor party at the farmhouse.  Sherry scorns her mother for having sex with George and Frank before running away.  She runs to George's beach house where she sees her father playing a game of [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] with Sandy and her son.  George looks out the window and sees Sherry sitting on a pier.  He goes to comfort her and as they reconcile, he gives Sherry the typewriter.\n\nGeorge returns Sherry to the farmhouse, where Faith invites him to visit the tennis court and meet Frank's friends.  Under a seemingly friendly facade, George praises Frank for his work on the tennis court.  He then goes into his car and crashes into the court repeatedly until it is demolished.

It stars [[Albert Finney]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Karen Allen]], [[Peter Weller]] and [[Dana Hill]]. Set in [[Marin County, California]], the film follows George (Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Keaton), whose deteriorating marriage, separation and love affairs devastate their four children. The title of the film alludes to the move of \"[[Hearts (card game)#Shooting the moon|shooting the moon]]\" in the card game [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\nGoldman began writing the script in 1971, deriving inspiration from his encounters with [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional couples]]. He spent several years trying to secure a major film studio to produce it before taking it to [[20th Century Fox]]. Parker learned of the script as he was developing ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), and he later worked with Goldman to rewrite it. After an unsuccessful pre-production development at Fox, Parker moved the project to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which provided a budget of $12 million. [[Principal photography]] lasted 62 days, in the period from January to April 1981, on location in Marin County.\n\n''Shoot the Moon'' premiered on February 19, 1982 to mostly positive reviews, but was deemed a [[box office bomb|box-office failure]], having grossed only $9.2 million in North America. It later competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]], and received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] (Finney) and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress \u2013 Drama]] (Keaton).\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Marin County, California]], writer George Dunlap and his wife Faith are an unhappy couple who live with their daughters Sherry, Jill, Marianne and Molly in a farmhouse that George has refurbished.  George is preparing to attend an awards banquet in his honor, when he receives a phone call from Sandy, a single mother with whom he has begun an affair.  Sherry, the oldest of the four children, picks up the phone and listens in on the conversation.  \n\nAfter the kids leave for school the next morning, Faith expresses her suspicions of the affair, prompting George to leave and move into his beach house.  Sherry refuses to speak to George, while her sisters visit George on weekends.  Jill, Marianne and Molly also meet Sandy, who harbors cynicism towards them and views them as a distraction in her sexual affair with George.\n\nFaith falls into depression, but is elated when she begins a relationship with Frank Henderson, a contractor she has hired to build a tennis court on the grove of the farmhouse.  One day, George visits the farmhouse, aggressively requesting to Faith that he be able to give Sherry her birthday present, a typewriter.  George grows frustrated upon meeting Frank and seeing the construction work being done to the yard.  George returns to the home later that night, again demanding that he be able to give Sherry her present.  When Faith refuses to let him in, George breaks the door apart, pushes her out of the house, and blocks the entrance door with a chair. After Sherry refuses the gift, George spanks her repeatedly.  The other children try to fight him off, but George does not relent until after Sherry threatens him with a pair of scissors.  After letting herself back into the house, Faith comforts a sobbing Sherry, and George leaves ashamed.\n\nGeorge and Faith go to court to begin the first stage of their divorce proceedings, which involves joint custody of the children.  After the court hearing, Faith tells George that her father has been hospitalized.  At the hospital, they both downplay the disintegration of their marriage, but Faith\u2019s father senses that they are lying, and dies shortly thereafter. \n\nAfter the funeral, George finds Faith having dinner at a restaurant and joins her.  They have a heated, passionate exchange, arguing about their relationship before getting drunk. They go to a hotel room where Faith and the children are staying, and have sex.  After Sherry enters Faith's bedroom and finds them lying in bed, Faith asks George to leave.\n\nWhen the tennis court is completed, Faith and Frank throw an outdoor party at the farmhouse.  Sherry scorns her mother for having sex with George and Frank before running away.  She runs to George's beach house where she sees her father playing a game of [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] with Sandy and her son.  George looks out the window and sees Sherry sitting on a pier.  He goes to comfort her and as they reconcile, he gives Sherry the typewriter.\n\nGeorge returns Sherry to the farmhouse, where Faith invites him to visit the tennis court and meet Frank's friends.  Under a seemingly friendly facade, George praises Frank for his work on the tennis court.  He then goes into his car and crashes into the court repeatedly until it is demolished.  Enraged, Frank pulls George out of the car and beats him relentlessly before walking away.  As the children try to comfort their father, George reaches out his hand and calls out for Faith.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Albert Finney]] as George Dunlap \n*[[Diane Keaton]] as Faith Dunlap\n*[[Karen Allen]] as Sandy\n*[[Peter Weller]] as Frank Henderson\n*[[Dana Hill]] as Sherry Dunlap\n*[[Viveka Davis]] as Jill Dunlap\n*[[Tracey Gold]] as Marianne Dunlap\n*[[Tina Yothers]] as Molly Dunlap\n*[[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as French DeVoe\n*[[Leora Dana]] as Charlotte DeVoe\n*Irving Metzman as Howard Katz\n*[[Robert Costanzo]] as Leo Spinelli\n*[[David Landsberg]] as Scott Gruber\n*[[O-Lan Jones|O-Lan Shepard]] as Countergirl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Alan Parker (Director), London, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Director [[Alan Parker]], pictured in 2008]]\n''Shoot the Moon'' was [[Bo Goldman]]'s first attempt at writing a screenplay and was originally developed under the title ''Switching''.

The digestive enzymes break down proteins and bile [[emulsify|emulsifies]] fats into [[micelles]]. The [[duodenum]] contains [[Brunner's glands]], which produce a mucus-rich alkaline secretion containing [[bicarbonate]]. These secretions, in combination with bicarbonate from the pancreas, neutralize the stomach acids contained in gastric chyme.\n* The '''[[jejunum]]''' is the midsection of the small intestine, connecting the duodenum to the ileum. It is about 2.5 m long, and contains the [[plicae circulares]], and [[intestinal villus|villi]] that increase its surface area. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream here. The [[suspensory muscle of duodenum]] marks the division between the duodenum and the jejunum.\n* The '''[[ileum]]''': The final section of the small intestine. It is about 3 m long, and contains [[intestinal villus|villi]] similar to the jejunum. It absorbs mainly [[vitamin B12]] and [[bile acids]], as well as any other remaining nutrients.

Many of the [[digestive enzyme]]s that act in the small intestine are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and [[liver]] and enter the small intestine via the [[pancreatic duct]]. Pancreatic enzymes and [[bile]] from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the Hormone [[cholecystokinin]], which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients. [[Secretin]], another hormone produced in the small intestine, causes additional effects on the pancreas, where it promotes the release of [[bicarbonate]] into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.\n\nThe three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s (fats) and [[carbohydrate]]s:\n\n*  Proteins are degraded into small [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s before absorption.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silk DB |title=Progress report. Peptide absorption in man|journal=Gut |volume=15|issue=6|pages=494\u2013501|year=1974|pmid= 4604970 |pmc=1413009 |doi=10.1136/gut.15.6.494}}</ref> Chemical breakdown begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine. Proteolytic enzymes, including [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]], are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and cleave proteins into smaller peptides. Carboxypeptidase, which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme, splits one amino acid at a time. [[Aminopeptidase]] and [[dipeptidase]] free the end amino acid products.\n* Lipids (fats) are degraded into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Pancreatic lipase breaks down [[triglyceride]]s into free fatty acids and [[monoglyceride]]s. Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the [[bile]] secreted by the [[liver]] and stored in the [[gall bladder]]. Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help [[emulsion|emulsify]] them, which aids access by pancreatic lipase. This occurs because the lipase is water-soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings. The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption.\n* Some [[carbohydrate]]s are degraded into simple sugars, or [[monosaccharide]]s (e.g., [[glucose]]). Pancreatic amylase breaks down some carbohydrates (notably [[starch]]) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested into the large intestine and further handling by [[intestinal bacteria]]. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and glucoamylase, which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are maltase, sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in some adult humans and, for them, lactose (a disaccharide), as well as most polysaccharides, is not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as [[cellulose]], are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple [[glucose]] units. This is because the cellulose is made out of beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.\n\n===Absorption===\nDigested food is now able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through either [[diffusion]] or active transport. The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The inner wall, or mucosa, of the small intestine is lined with simple columnar [[intestinal epithelium|epithelial]] tissue. Structurally, the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or folds called [[plicae circulares]], which are considered permanent features in the wall of the organ. They are distinct from [[rugae]] which are considered non-permanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction. From the plicae circulares project microscopic finger-like pieces of tissue called [[intestinal villus|villi]] ([[Latin]] for \"shaggy hair\"). The individual epithelial cells also have finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]]. The functions of the plicae circulares, the villi, and the microvilli are to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of [[nutrient]]s, and to limit the loss of said nutrients to intestinal fauna.\n\nEach villus has a network of [[capillary|capillaries]] and fine lymphatic vessels called [[lacteal]]s close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and lacteals (lipids). The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body. The material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine.\n\nAbsorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the [[jejunum]], with the following notable exceptions:\n* [[Iron]] is absorbed in the duodenum.\n* [[Folate]] (Vitamin B9) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.\n* [[Vitamin B12]] and [[bile salts]] are absorbed in the [[terminal ileum]].\n* Water is absorbed by [[osmosis]] and [[Lipid|lipids]] by passive diffusion throughout the small intestine.\n\n* [[Sodium bicarbonate]] is absorbed by active transport and [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]] [[co-transport]]\n* [[Fructose]] is absorbed by [[facilitated diffusion]].\n\n===Immunological===\nThe small intestine supports the body's [[immune system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1533|title=Intestinal immune cells play an unexpected role in immune surveillance of the bloodstream|publisher= Massachusetts General Hospital|date=13 December 2012}}</ref>  The presence of [[gut flora]] appears to contribute positively to the host's immune system. \n[[Peyer's patch]]es, located within the ileum of the small intestine, are an important part of the digestive tract's local immune system.

In teleosts, it is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish's body. It commonly has a number of ''pyloric caeca'', small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the [[rectum]] being marked only by the end of the digestive epitheliu.<ref name=VB/>\n\nIn tetrapods, the [[ileocaecal valve]] is always present, opening into the colon.

The lining of the small intestine includes microscopic folds to increase its surface area in all vertebrates, but only in mammals do these develop into true villi.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThe boundaries between the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum are somewhat vague even in humans, and such distinctions are either ignored when discussing the anatomy of other animals, or are essentially arbitrary.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 349\u2013353|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\nThere is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as [[shark]]s, [[sturgeon]]s, and [[lungfish]].

This valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine. The lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods.<ref name=VB/>\n\nIn [[lamprey]]s, the spiral valve is extremely small, possibly because their diet requires little digestion.

Many of the [[digestive enzyme]]s that act in the small intestine are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and [[liver]] and enter the small intestine via the [[pancreatic duct]]. Pancreatic enzymes and [[bile]] from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the Hormone [[cholecystokinin]], which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients. [[Secretin]], another hormone produced in the small intestine, causes additional effects on the pancreas, where it promotes the release of [[bicarbonate]] into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.\n\nThe three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s (fats) and [[carbohydrate]]s:\n\n*  Proteins are degraded into small [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s before absorption.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silk DB |title=Progress report.

Proteolytic enzymes, including [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]], are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and cleave proteins into smaller peptides. Carboxypeptidase, which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme, splits one amino acid at a time. [[Aminopeptidase]] and [[dipeptidase]] free the end amino acid products.\n* Lipids (fats) are degraded into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Pancreatic lipase breaks down [[triglyceride]]s into free fatty acids and [[monoglyceride]]s. Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the [[bile]] secreted by the [[liver]] and stored in the [[gall bladder]]. Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help [[emulsion|emulsify]] them, which aids access by pancreatic lipase. This occurs because the lipase is water-soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings. The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption.\n* Some [[carbohydrate]]s are degraded into simple sugars, or [[monosaccharide]]s (e.g., [[glucose]]). Pancreatic amylase breaks down some carbohydrates (notably [[starch]]) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested into the large intestine and further handling by [[intestinal bacteria]]. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and glucoamylase, which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are maltase, sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in some adult humans and, for them, lactose (a disaccharide), as well as most polysaccharides, is not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as [[cellulose]], are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple [[glucose]] units. This is because the cellulose is made out of beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.\n\n===Absorption===\nDigested food is now able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through either [[diffusion]] or active transport. The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The inner wall, or mucosa, of the small intestine is lined with simple columnar [[intestinal epithelium|epithelial]] tissue. Structurally, the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or folds called [[plicae circulares]], which are considered permanent features in the wall of the organ. They are distinct from [[rugae]] which are considered non-permanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction. From the plicae circulares project microscopic finger-like pieces of tissue called [[intestinal villus|villi]] ([[Latin]] for \"shaggy hair\"). The individual epithelial cells also have finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]]. The functions of the plicae circulares, the villi, and the microvilli are to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of [[nutrient]]s, and to limit the loss of said nutrients to intestinal fauna.\n\nEach villus has a network of [[capillary|capillaries]] and fine lymphatic vessels called [[lacteal]]s close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and lacteals (lipids). The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body. The material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine.\n\nAbsorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the [[jejunum]], with the following notable exceptions:\n* [[Iron]] is absorbed in the duodenum.\n* [[Folate]] (Vitamin B9) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.\n* [[Vitamin B12]] and [[bile salts]] are absorbed in the [[terminal ileum]].\n* Water is absorbed by [[osmosis]] and [[Lipid|lipids]] by passive diffusion throughout the small intestine.\n\n* [[Sodium bicarbonate]] is absorbed by active transport and [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]] [[co-transport]]\n* [[Fructose]] is absorbed by [[facilitated diffusion]].\n\n===Immunological===\nThe small intestine supports the body's [[immune system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1533|title=Intestinal immune cells play an unexpected role in immune surveillance of the bloodstream|publisher= Massachusetts General Hospital|date=13 December 2012}}</ref>  The presence of [[gut flora]] appears to contribute positively to the host's immune system. \n[[Peyer's patch]]es, located within the ileum of the small intestine, are an important part of the digestive tract's local immune system.

In teleosts, it is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish's body. It commonly has a number of ''pyloric caeca'', small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the [[rectum]] being marked only by the end of the digestive epitheliu.<ref name=VB/>\n\nIn tetrapods, the [[ileocaecal valve]] is always present, opening into the colon. The length of the small intestine is typically longer in tetrapods than in teleosts, but is especially so in [[herbivore]]s, as well as in mammals and [[bird]]s, which have a higher [[metabolic rate]] than [[amphibian]]s or [[reptile]]s. The lining of the small intestine includes microscopic folds to increase its surface area in all vertebrates, but only in mammals do these develop into true villi.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThe boundaries between the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum are somewhat vague even in humans, and such distinctions are either ignored when discussing the anatomy of other animals, or are essentially arbitrary.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 349\u2013353|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\nThere is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as [[shark]]s, [[sturgeon]]s, and [[lungfish]]. Instead, the digestive part of the gut forms a '''spiral intestine''', connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the intestine itself is relatively straight but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns.

The plot tells the story of a troubled man who videotapes women discussing their lives and sexuality, and his impact on the relationships of a troubled married couple and the wife's younger sister.\n\nThe film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]], and was influential in revolutionizing the independent film movement in the early 1990s. In 2006, ''Sex, Lies, and Videotape'' was added to the United States [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]], deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\nAnn Bishop Mullany lives in [[Baton Rouge]]. She is unhappily married to John, a successful [[lawyer]], and they live in a comfortable home. Ann has a personal complaint about intimacy she expresses to her sister: she has never experienced an orgasm. She is in therapy. Graham Dalton is an old close college friend of John. He is now a [[Drifter (person)|drifter]] with some money saved up. Nine years after college Graham returns to visit and perhaps live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives at John's to meet Ann. Later she learns that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's subtle disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. The men discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is still living in Baton Rouge.\n\nJohn is cheating on Ann with her sister, Cynthia, a free-spirited and friendly  bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's [[Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigidity]]. John frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet for trysts with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients, even when they are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann ends up helping Graham look for an apartment. After Graham finds a place, Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment. While visiting she notices stacks of [[camcorder]] videotapes, all with women's names on them around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their  sexual experiences, sex fantasies, and records them on videotape. After hearing Graham, Ann is suddenly overcome with shock and confusion, and quickly leaves his apartment.\n\nWithin a day, Ann's outgoing sister Cynthia appears uninvited at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what incident \"spooked\" Ann the preceding day. Graham briefly and reluctantly explains the sexual interview videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of  a woman, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make an interview tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports doing a videotape with Graham back to Ann, who is horrified. Later Cynthia also tells John about her videotape and he also reacts very negatively (though more than a little possessively).\n\nCleaning her home the next day, Ann discovers Cynthia's [[pearl]] [[earring]] in her bedroom (she knows the earring belongs to her sister, since she had mentioned that she had lost it) while vacuuming. Ann is then furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her making a videotape is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. Ann insists on making a videotape, and Graham relents.\n\nAfterward at home, Ann then angrily demands a [[divorce]] from John. In the ensuing shouting argument, John quickly learns that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a sexual video. John rushes to Graham's apartment, suddenly hits him and then locks him out of the house. John then watches Ann's tape. In the video, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham, who resists but she persists. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is an attempt to achieve some closure. Graham explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Ann starts touching and kissing Graham; Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex.\n\nA chastened John joins Graham on the front porch and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple.  But John also helps Graham see his ex Elizabeth in a more realistic way. He states, \"She was no saint. She was good in bed, and she could keep a secret. That's all I can say about her.\" and then leaves. This statement makes Graham furious and he goes into a rage and destroys all of the videotapes, as well as his video camera.\n\nThe next day, John is summoned to his boss's legal office, where it's implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients of the firm to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends. Ann then goes to Graham's place and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.\n\n== Cast ==  \n* [[James Spader]] as Graham Dalton\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Ann Bishop Mullany\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as John Mullany\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Cynthia Patrice Bishop\n* [[Steven Brill (scriptwriter)|Steven Brill]] as Barfly\n* [[Ron Vawter]] as Therapist\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was written by [[Steven Soderbergh]] in eight days on a yellow legal pad during a cross country trip (although, as Soderbergh points out in his [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], he had been thinking about the film for a year).\n\nSoderbergh's commentary also reveals that he had written [[Andie MacDowell]]'s role with [[Elizabeth McGovern]] in mind, but McGovern's agent disliked the script so much that McGovern never even got to read it. [[Laura San Giacomo]], who was represented by the same agency, had to threaten to leave that agency in order to be able to play Cynthia. Soderbergh was reluctant to audition MacDowell but she surprised him, getting the role after two extremely successful auditions. The role of John would have been played by [[Tim Daly]], but delays in completing the financing for the film led to [[Peter Gallagher]]'s getting the role instead.\n\nWith a budget of only $1.2 million, a week of rehearsal and a month-long shoot in August 1988 was all Soderbergh could afford. He would later call it \u201cthe only movie I\u2019ve ever made where I felt like I had all the money and all the time I needed.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/472665/how-sex-lies-and-videotape-changed-indie-filmmaking-forever|title=How \u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 Changed Indie Filmmaking Forever|date=18 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/sex-lies-videotape-steven-soderberghs-groundbreaking-debut-shook-indie-filmmaking-scene/|title='Sex, Lies, and Videotape': Steven Soderbergh's Groundbreaking Debut that Shook the Indie Filmmaking Scene \u2022 Cinephilia & Beyond|date=23 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Sex, Lies, and Videotape'' opened in a [[limited release]] on August 4, 1989, in 4 theaters and grossed $155,982, with an average of $38,995 per theater.

LaBute's presence leads to conversational tangents unrelated to the film, although most of the tangents are related to the question of what it means to be a director, and are intended, as Soderbergh summarizes at the end, to \"demystify\" the process of making a film. LaBute's presence prompts Soderbergh to talk about reverse zooms, [[Camera dolly|dolly]] shots, how actors have varying expectations of their director, the difference between stealing from a film you admire and paying tribute to it, shooting out of sequence, how the role of a director changes as their success (and their budgets) grow, and other filmmaking topics.\n\n== Adaptations==\nThe movie was presented as a staged play in Hollywood at the Next Stage from December 13, 2003 to January 17, 2004. Directed by Seth Wiley and a cast that featured Amanda Bauman (Ann), Emily Williams (Therapist), Shauna Slade (Cynthia), Justin Christenson (Graham), and Jack Sundmacher (John).<ref>{{cite web|last=Kendt |first=Rob |url=https://www.backstage.com/review/sex-lies-and-videotape/ |title=Sex, Lies, And Videotape |publisher=Backstage |date=2003-01-08 |accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== \"An unofficial sequel of sorts\" ==\nA sequel was announced in 2001 and [[Catherine Keener]] was the first actor attached to the project, named ''How to Survive a Hotel Room Fire''.

Graham briefly and reluctantly explains the sexual interview videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of  a woman, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make an interview tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports doing a videotape with Graham back to Ann, who is horrified. Later Cynthia also tells John about her videotape and he also reacts very negatively (though more than a little possessively).\n\nCleaning her home the next day, Ann discovers Cynthia's [[pearl]] [[earring]] in her bedroom (she knows the earring belongs to her sister, since she had mentioned that she had lost it) while vacuuming. Ann is then furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her making a videotape is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. Ann insists on making a videotape, and Graham relents.\n\nAfterward at home, Ann then angrily demands a [[divorce]] from John. In the ensuing shouting argument, John quickly learns that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a sexual video. John rushes to Graham's apartment, suddenly hits him and then locks him out of the house. John then watches Ann's tape. In the video, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham, who resists but she persists. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is an attempt to achieve some closure. Graham explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Ann starts touching and kissing Graham; Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex.\n\nA chastened John joins Graham on the front porch and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple.  But John also helps Graham see his ex Elizabeth in a more realistic way. He states, \"She was no saint. She was good in bed, and she could keep a secret. That's all I can say about her.\" and then leaves. This statement makes Graham furious and he goes into a rage and destroys all of the videotapes, as well as his video camera.\n\nThe next day, John is summoned to his boss's legal office, where it\u2019s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients of the firm to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends. Ann then goes to Graham's place and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.\n\n== Cast ==  \n* [[James Spader]] as Graham Dalton\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Ann Bishop Mullany\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as John Mullany\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Cynthia Patrice Bishop\n* [[Steven Brill (scriptwriter)|Steven Brill]] as Barfly\n* [[Ron Vawter]] as Therapist\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was written by [[Steven Soderbergh]] in eight days on a yellow legal pad during a cross country trip (although, as Soderbergh points out in his [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], he had been thinking about the film for a year).\n\nSoderbergh's commentary also reveals that he had written [[Andie MacDowell]]'s role with [[Elizabeth McGovern]] in mind, but McGovern's agent disliked the script so much that McGovern never even got to read it. [[Laura San Giacomo]], who was represented by the same agency, had to threaten to leave that agency in order to be able to play Cynthia. Soderbergh was reluctant to audition MacDowell but she surprised him, getting the role after two extremely successful auditions. The role of John would have been played by [[Tim Daly]], but delays in completing the financing for the film led to [[Peter Gallagher]]'s getting the role instead.\n\nWith a budget of only $1.2 million, a week of rehearsal and a month-long shoot in August 1988 was all Soderbergh could afford. He would later call it \u201cthe only movie I\u2019ve ever made where I felt like I had all the money and all the time I needed.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/472665/how-sex-lies-and-videotape-changed-indie-filmmaking-forever|title=How \u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 Changed Indie Filmmaking Forever|date=18 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/sex-lies-videotape-steven-soderberghs-groundbreaking-debut-shook-indie-filmmaking-scene/|title='Sex, Lies, and Videotape': Steven Soderbergh's Groundbreaking Debut that Shook the Indie Filmmaking Scene \u2022 Cinephilia & Beyond|date=23 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Sex, Lies, and Videotape'' opened in a [[limited release]] on August 4, 1989, in 4 theaters and grossed $155,982, with an average of $38,995 per theater.

LaBute's presence leads to conversational tangents unrelated to the film, although most of the tangents are related to the question of what it means to be a director, and are intended, as Soderbergh summarizes at the end, to \"demystify\" the process of making a film. LaBute's presence prompts Soderbergh to talk about reverse zooms, [[Camera dolly|dolly]] shots, how actors have varying expectations of their director, the difference between stealing from a film you admire and paying tribute to it, shooting out of sequence, how the role of a director changes as their success (and their budgets) grow, and other filmmaking topics.\n\n== Adaptations==\nThe movie was presented as a staged play in Hollywood at the Next Stage from December 13, 2003 to January 17, 2004.

It is an adaptation of the [[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning|1958 novel of the same name]] by [[Alan Sillitoe]], who also wrote the screenplay adaptation. The film is about a young machinist, Arthur, who spends his weekends drinking and partying, all the while having an affair with a married woman.\n\nThe film is one of a series of \"[[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]]\" films made in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as part of the [[British New Wave]] of filmmaking, from directors such as Reisz, [[Jack Clayton]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Schlesinger]] and Tony Richardson and adapted from the works of writers such as Sillitoe, [[John Braine]] and [[John Osborne]]. A common trope in these films was the working-class \"[[Angry young men|angry young man]]\" character (in this case, the character of Arthur), who rebels against the oppressive system of his elders.\n\nIn 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' the 14th greatest British film of all time on their [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]] list.\n\n==Plot==\nArthur Seaton is a young machinist at the [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] bicycle factory in [[Nottingham]]. He is determined not to be tied down to living a life of domestic drudgery like the people around him, including his parents, whom he describes as \"dead from the neck up\". He spends his wages at weekends on drinking and having a good time.\n\nArthur is having an affair with Brenda, the wife of an older colleague. He also begins a more traditional relationship with Doreen, a beautiful single woman closer to his age. Doreen, who lives with her mother and aspires to be married, avoids Arthur's sexual advances, so he continues to see Brenda as a sexual outlet.\n\nBrenda becomes pregnant by Arthur, who offers to help raise the child or terminate the unwanted pregnancy (as [[abortion]] was not legal in Britain at the time of the film). Arthur takes her to see his Aunt Ada for advice. Ada has Brenda sit in a hot bath and drink gin, which does not work. Brenda asks Arthur for \u00a340 to get an abortion from a doctor. \n\nAfter Doreen complains about not going anywhere public with Arthur, he takes her to the [[fair]] where he sees Brenda. Arthur pulls Brenda aside, and she reveals that she has decided to have the child. As Arthur clings to her, she wriggles free because she is at the fair with her family. Arthur follows her on to an [[amusement ride]] and gets in a car with her. Brenda's brother-in-law and his friend notice her enter the ride and follow her, shocked to see Arthur riding with his arm around Brenda. Arthur escapes the ride, but he is later caught and beaten. \n\nArthur spends a week recovering and is visited by Doreen; they later have sex. After recovering, Arthur returns to work, and realises his affair with Brenda is finished after her husband tells him to stay away from Brenda. Arthur decides to marry Doreen. The film ends with Arthur and Doreen discussing the prospect of a new home together, with Arthur showing that he still has mixed feelings about settling down into domestic life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Arthur Seaton \n* [[Shirley Anne Field]] as Doreen \n* [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]] as Brenda \n* [[Hylda Baker]] as Aunt Ada \n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Bert \n* [[Bryan Pringle]] as Jack \n* Robert Cawdron as Robboe \n* Edna Morris as Mrs Bull \n* [[Elsie Wagstaff]] as Mrs Seaton \n* [[Frank Pettitt]] as Mr Seaton \n* [[Avis Bunnage]] as Blousy Woman \n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Loudmouth \n* Irene Richmond as Doreen's Mother \n* Louise Dunn as Betty \n* Anne Blake as Civil Defence Officer \n* [[Peter Madden (actor)|Peter Madden]] as Drunken Man \n* [[Cameron Hall (actor)|Cameron Hall]] as Mr Bull \n* [[Alister Williamson]] as Police Constable\n* [[Peter Sallis]] as Man in Suit (uncredited)\n* [[Jack Smethurst]] as Waiter (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Style===\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' was at the forefront of the [[British New Wave]], portraying British working class life in a serious manner for the first time and dealing realistically with sex and abortion. It was among the first of the \"[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]]s\" that followed the success of the play ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''. Producer [[Tony Richardson]] later directed another such film, ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' (1962), which was also adapted from an Alan Sillitoe [[The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (collection)|book of the same name]].\n\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' received an [[X rating]] from the [[BBFC]] upon its theatrical release.   It was re-rated PG for the 1990 home video release.<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/saturday-night-and-sunday-morning-2002 ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning''] BBFC page</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nMuch of the exterior location filming was shot in [[Nottingham]], though some scenes were shot elsewhere. The night scene with a pub named \"The British Flag\" in the background was filmed along Culvert Road in [[Battersea]], London, the pub being at the junction of Culvert Road and Sheepcote Lane (now Rowditch Lane).\n\nThe closing scenes show Arthur and Doreen on a grassy slope overlooking a housing estate with new construction going on. According to an article in the ''Nottingham Evening News'' on 30 March 1960, this was shot in [[Wembley]] with the assistance of [[Nottingham]] builders Simms Sons & Cooke who set up a staged \"building site\" on location.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n===Finance===\nBryanston guaranteed \u00a381,820 of the budget, the NFFC provided \u00a328,000, Twickenham Studios provided \u00a3610 and Richardson deferred his producers fee of \u00a3965. The film went \u00a33,500 over budget and two days over schedule when filming at a Nottingham factory proved more difficult than expected.<ref>Petrie p 9</ref>\n==Reception==\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' opened at the Warner cinema in London's West End on 27 October 1960 and received generally favourable reviews. The film entered general release on the [[ABC Cinemas|ABC cinema circuit]] from late January 1961 and was a box-office success, being the third most popular film in Britain that year. It earned over half a million pounds in profit.<ref name=\"tino\">Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 239</ref>\n\nBryanston earned \u00a3145,000 in profit on the film.<ref>Petrie p 9</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

It is an adaptation of the [[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning|1958 novel of the same name]] by [[Alan Sillitoe]], who also wrote the screenplay adaptation. The film is about a young machinist, Arthur, who spends his weekends drinking and partying, all the while having an affair with a married woman.\n\nThe film is one of a series of \"[[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]]\" films made in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as part of the [[British New Wave]] of filmmaking, from directors such as Reisz, [[Jack Clayton]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Schlesinger]] and Tony Richardson and adapted from the works of writers such as Sillitoe, [[John Braine]] and [[John Osborne]]. A common trope in these films was the working-class \"[[Angry young men|angry young man]]\" character (in this case, the character of Arthur), who rebels against the oppressive system of his elders.\n\nIn 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' the 14th greatest British film of all time on their [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]] list.\n\n==Plot==\nArthur Seaton is a young machinist at the [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] bicycle factory in [[Nottingham]]. He is determined not to be tied down to living a life of domestic drudgery like the people around him, including his parents, whom he describes as \"dead from the neck up\". He spends his wages at weekends on drinking and having a good time.\n\nArthur is having an affair with Brenda, the wife of an older colleague. He also begins a more traditional relationship with Doreen, a beautiful single woman closer to his age. Doreen, who lives with her mother and aspires to be married, avoids Arthur's sexual advances, so he continues to see Brenda as a sexual outlet.\n\nBrenda becomes pregnant by Arthur, who offers to help raise the child or terminate the unwanted pregnancy (as [[abortion]] was not legal in Britain at the time of the film). Arthur takes her to see his Aunt Ada for advice. Ada has Brenda sit in a hot bath and drink gin, which does not work. Brenda asks Arthur for \u00a340 to get an abortion from a doctor. \n\nAfter Doreen complains about not going anywhere public with Arthur, he takes her to the [[fair]] where he sees Brenda. Arthur pulls Brenda aside, and she reveals that she has decided to have the child. As Arthur clings to her, she wriggles free because she is at the fair with her family. Arthur follows her on to an [[amusement ride]] and gets in a car with her. Brenda's brother-in-law and his friend notice her enter the ride and follow her, shocked to see Arthur riding with his arm around Brenda. Arthur escapes the ride, but he is later caught and beaten. \n\nArthur spends a week recovering and is visited by Doreen; they later have sex. After recovering, Arthur returns to work, and realises his affair with Brenda is finished after her husband tells him to stay away from Brenda. Arthur decides to marry Doreen. The film ends with Arthur and Doreen discussing the prospect of a new home together, with Arthur showing that he still has mixed feelings about settling down into domestic life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Arthur Seaton \n* [[Shirley Anne Field]] as Doreen \n* [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]] as Brenda \n* [[Hylda Baker]] as Aunt Ada \n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Bert \n* [[Bryan Pringle]] as Jack \n* Robert Cawdron as Robboe \n* Edna Morris as Mrs Bull \n* [[Elsie Wagstaff]] as Mrs Seaton \n* [[Frank Pettitt]] as Mr Seaton \n* [[Avis Bunnage]] as Blousy Woman \n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Loudmouth \n* Irene Richmond as Doreen's Mother \n* Louise Dunn as Betty \n* Anne Blake as Civil Defence Officer \n* [[Peter Madden (actor)|Peter Madden]] as Drunken Man \n* [[Cameron Hall (actor)|Cameron Hall]] as Mr Bull \n* [[Alister Williamson]] as Police Constable\n* [[Peter Sallis]] as Man in Suit (uncredited)\n* [[Jack Smethurst]] as Waiter (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Style===\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' was at the forefront of the [[British New Wave]], portraying British working class life in a serious manner for the first time and dealing realistically with sex and abortion. It was among the first of the \"[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]]s\" that followed the success of the play ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''. Producer [[Tony Richardson]] later directed another such film, ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' (1962), which was also adapted from an Alan Sillitoe [[The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (collection)|book of the same name]].\n\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' received an [[X rating]] from the [[BBFC]] upon its theatrical release.   It was re-rated PG for the 1990 home video release.<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/saturday-night-and-sunday-morning-2002 ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning''] BBFC page</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nMuch of the exterior location filming was shot in [[Nottingham]], though some scenes were shot elsewhere. The night scene with a pub named \"The British Flag\" in the background was filmed along Culvert Road in [[Battersea]], London, the pub being at the junction of Culvert Road and Sheepcote Lane (now Rowditch Lane).\n\nThe closing scenes show Arthur and Doreen on a grassy slope overlooking a housing estate with new construction going on. According to an article in the ''Nottingham Evening News'' on 30 March 1960, this was shot in [[Wembley]] with the assistance of [[Nottingham]] builders Simms Sons & Cooke who set up a staged \"building site\" on location.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n===Finance===\nBryanston guaranteed \u00a381,820 of the budget, the NFFC provided \u00a328,000, Twickenham Studios provided \u00a3610 and Richardson deferred his producers fee of \u00a3965. The film went \u00a33,500 over budget and two days over schedule when filming at a Nottingham factory proved more difficult than expected.<ref>Petrie p 9</ref>\n==Reception==\n''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' opened at the Warner cinema in London's West End on 27 October 1960 and received generally favourable reviews. The film entered general release on the [[ABC Cinemas|ABC cinema circuit]] from late January 1961 and was a box-office success, being the third most popular film in Britain that year. It earned over half a million pounds in profit.<ref name=\"tino\">Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 239</ref>\n\nBryanston earned \u00a3145,000 in profit on the film.<ref>Petrie p 9</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

Written by Antonioni and [[Tonino Guerra]], it was Antonioni's first [[color motion picture film|color film]]. The story follows a troubled woman (Vitti) living in an [[industrial region]] of [[Northern Italy]] following a recent automobile accident.\n\n''Il deserto rosso'' was awarded the [[Golden Lion]] at the 25th [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1964. It has received acclaim from critics.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=deserto_rosso|title=Red Desert}}</ref> This was the last in a series of four films he made with Vitti between 1959 and 1964, preceded by ''[[L'Avventura]]'' (1960), ''[[La Notte]]'' (1961), and ''[[L'Eclisse]]'' (1962).\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Ravenna]], Italy, Giuliana ([[Monica Vitti]]) is walking with her young son, Valerio, towards the petrochemical plant managed by her husband, Ugo. Passing workers who are on strike, Giuliana nervously and impulsively purchases a half-eaten sandwich from one of the workers. They are surrounded by strange industrial structures and debris that create inhuman images and sounds. Inside the plant, Ugo (Carlo Chionetti) is talking with a visiting business associate, Corrado Zeller ([[Richard Harris]]), who is looking to recruit workers for an industrial operation in [[Patagonia]], Argentina. Ugo and Corrado converse comfortably in the noisy factory. Ugo tells Corrado that his wife, Giuliana, had a recent auto accident, and though she was physically unhurt, she has not been right mentally. That night in their apartment, Giuliana becomes highly agitated and fearful over a dream she had about sinking in quicksand. Ugo is unable to calm her or understand what she's experiencing.\n\nAttracted to Giuliana, Corrado visits her at an empty shop she's planning to open and talks about his life and the restless nature of his existence. She accompanies him to [[Ferrara]] on one of his worker recruitment drives, and she indirectly reveals details about her mental state. She tells him that when she was in the hospital, she met a young woman patient who was advised by her doctors to find someone or something to love\u2014a husband, a son, a job, even a dog. She speaks of the young woman feeling like there was \"no ground beneath her, like she was sliding down a slope, sinking, always on the verge of drowning.\" They travel to a radio observatory in [[Medicina]], where Corrado hopes to recruit a top worker. Surrounded by cold industrial architecture, Giuliana seems lost in her loneliness and isolation.\n\nThe following weekend, Giuliana, Ugo, and Corrado are walking beside a polluted estuary where they meet up with another couple, Max and Linda, and together they drive to a small riverside shack at Porto Corsini where they meet Emilia. They spend time in the shack engaged in trivial small talk filled with jokes, role-playing, and sexual innuendo. Giuliana seems to find temporary solace in these mindless distractions. A mysterious ship docks directly outside their shack, and as she looks out to the open sea, Giuliana confides to Corrado, \"I can't look at the sea for long or I lose interest in what's happening on land.\" During their conversations, Corrado and Giuliana have grown closer, and he shows interest and sympathy for her. Like Giuliana, Corrado is also alienated, but he is better adapted to and accepting of his environment, telling her, \"You wonder what to look at; I wonder how to live.\" When a doctor arrives to board the ship, Giuliana, seeing that the ship is now quarantined due to an infectious disease, rushes off in a state of panic. Her unwillingness to stay, or to return to the shack to retrieve the purse she left behind, underscores her state of alienation from the others.\n\nSometime later, Ugo leaves on a business trip, and Giuliana spends more time with Corrado, revealing more about her anxieties. One day she discovers that her son has apparently become suddenly paralyzed from the waist down. Fearing he has contracted polio, Giuliana tries to comfort her son with a story about a young girl who lives on an island and swims off a beach at an isolated cove. The girl is at home with her surroundings, but after a mysterious sailing ship approaches offshore, all the rocks of the cove seem to come alive and sing to her in one voice. Soon after, Giuliana discovers to her shock that Valerio was only pretending to be paralyzed. Unable to imagine why her son would do such a cruel thing, Guiliana's sense of loneliness and isolation returns.\n\nDesperate to end her inner turmoil, Giuliana goes to Corrado's apartment where he tries to force his affections on her. Initially resisting Corrado's advances, Giuliana eventually accepts his affections, and the two make love in his bed. The intimacy, however, does little to relieve Giuliana's sense of isolation. The next day, a distraught Giuliana leaves Corrado and wanders to a dockside ship where she meets a foreign sailor and tries to communicate her feelings to him, but he cannot understand her words. Acknowledging the reality of her isolation, she says, \"We are all separate.\" At that point, Giuliana seems to be completely alone and at her lowest state.\n\nSometime later, Giuliana is again walking with her son near her husband's plant. Valerio notices a nearby smokestack emitting poisonous yellow smoke and wonders if birds are being killed by the toxic emissions. Giuliana tells him that the birds have learned not to fly near the poisonous yellow smoke.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Monica Vitti]] as Giuliana\n* [[Richard Harris]] as Corrado Zeller\n* Carlo Chionetti as Ugo\n* Xenia Valderi as Linda\n* Rita Renoir as Emilia\n* Lili Rheims as Telescope operator's wife\n* Aldo Grotti as Max\n* Valerio Bartoleschi as Giuliana's son\n* Emanuela Paola Carboni as Girl in fable\n* Giuliano Missirini as Radio telescope operator\n\n==Production==\nThe working title of the film was ''Celeste e verde'' (''Sky blue and green'').<ref>Brunette, Peter.

Antonioni wrote \"I worked a lot in il deserto  rosso with the zoom lens to try and get two dimensional effect, to diminish the distance between people and objects, make them seem flattened against each other. Such flattening contributes to the sense of psychological oppression : Guiliana in several shots seems pinned against the wall and the bars between couples seem part of their body.\"\n\n===Themes===\n[[Image:reddes.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from the film: \"My intention...\" said Antonioni, \"was to translate the poetry of the world, in which even factories can be beautiful.\"]]\nAntonioni dismissed simple interpretations of the film as a condemnation of industrialism, saying:\n{{quote|It's too simplistic to say\u2014as many people have done\u2014that I am condemning the inhuman industrial world which oppresses the individuals and leads them to neurosis.

The [[Rashomon effect]] is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a woodcutter ({{lang|ja|\u6728\u6a35\u308a}}; ''Kikori'', played by [[Takashi Shimura]]) and a priest ({{lang|ja|\u65c5\u6cd5\u5e2b}}; ''Tabi H\u014dshi'', [[Minoru Chiaki]]) sitting beneath the [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon city gate]] to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest.  As he testifies he first found a woman's hat (which belonged to the wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to the bandit), then cut rope (which had bound the husband), then an amulet, and finally he came upon the body. Upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife travelling the same day the murder happened. Both men are then summoned to testify in court, where they meet the captured bandit Taj\u014dmaru ({{lang|ja|\u591a\u8944\u4e38}}), who claims to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpses her in the forest.\n\n===The bandit's story===\nTaj\u014dmaru ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), a notorious outlaw, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but eventually was seduced by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj\u014dmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In Taj\u014dmaru's recollection, they fought skillfully and fiercely, with Taj\u014dmaru praising the samurai's swordsmanship.  In the end, Taj\u014dmaru was the victor, and the woman ran away after the fight. At the end of his story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife.  He says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that the dagger's pearl inlay would have made it very valuable.  He laments having left it behind.\n\n===The wife's story===\nThe samurai's wife ([[Machiko Ky\u014d]]) tells a different story to the court. She says that Taj\u014dmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her so that she would be at peace. He continued to stare at her with a look of loathing. His expression disturbed her so much that she fainted with dagger in hand. She awoke to find her husband dead with the dagger in his chest. She attempted to kill herself, but failed in all her efforts.\n\n===The samurai's story===\nThe court then hears the story of the deceased samurai ([[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]]), told through a [[Mediumship|medium]] ({{lang|ja|\u5deb\u5973}}; ''[[miko]]'', [[Noriko Honma]]). The samurai claims that, after raping his wife, Taj\u014dmaru asked her to travel with him. She accepted and asked Taj\u014dmaru to kill her husband so that she would not feel the guilt of belonging to two men. Taj\u014dmaru, shocked by this request, grabbed her, and gave the samurai a choice of letting the woman go or killing her. \"For these words alone\", the dead samurai recounted, \"I was ready to pardon his crime\". The woman fled, and Taj\u014dmaru, after attempting to recapture her, gave up and set the samurai free. The samurai then [[seppuku|killed himself]] with his wife's dagger. Later, someone removed the dagger from his chest.\n\n===The woodcutter's story===\nBack at Rash\u014dmon gate (after the trial), the woodcutter states to the commoner that all three stories were falsehoods. The woodcutter says he witnessed the rape and murder, but that he declined the opportunity to testify at the trial because he did not want to get involved. According to the woodcutter's new story, Taj\u014dmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him, but the woman instead freed her husband. The husband was initially unwilling to fight Taj\u014dmaru, saying he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman, but the woman then criticized both him and Taj\u014dmaru, saying they were not real men and that a real man would fight for a woman's love. She urged the men to fight one another, but then hid her face in fear once they raised swords; the men, too, were visibly fearful as they began fighting. In the woodcutter's recollection, the resulting duel was far more pitiful and clumsy than Taj\u014dmaru had recounted previously, with the men constantly tripping and flailing their swords wildly. Taj\u014dmaru ultimately won through a stroke of luck. After some hesitation, he killed the samurai, and the woman subsequently fled. Taj\u014dmaru could not catch her, but took the samurai's sword and left the scene limping.\n\n===Climax===\nAt the gate, the woodcutter, priest, and commoner are interrupted from their discussion of the woodcutter's account by the sound of a crying baby. They find the baby abandoned in a basket, and the commoner takes a kimono and an amulet that have been left for the baby. The woodcutter reproaches the commoner for stealing from the abandoned baby, but the commoner chastises him. Having deduced that the reason the woodcutter did not speak up at the trial was because he was the one who stole the dagger from the scene of the murder, the commoner mocks him as \"a bandit calling another a bandit\". The commoner leaves Rash\u014dmon, claiming that all men are motivated only by [[psychological egoism|self-interest]].\n\nThese deceptions and lies shake the priest's faith in humanity. He claims it is restored when the woodcutter reaches for the baby in the priest's arms. The priest is suspicious at first, but the woodcutter explains that he intends to take care of the baby along with his own six children. This simple revelation recasts the woodcutter's story and the subsequent theft of the dagger in a new light. The priest gives the baby to the woodcutter, saying that the woodcutter has given him reason to continue having hope in humanity. The film closes on the woodcutter, walking home with the baby. The rain has stopped and the clouds have opened revealing the sun in contrast to the beginning where it was overcast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kikori, the wood cutter\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tabi H\u014dshi, the priest\n* Kichijiro Ueda as the listener, a common person\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as the Samurai's wife\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as the Samurai, the husband\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as [[Miko]], the medium\n* [[Daisuke Kat\u014d]] as Houben, the policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former [[Raj\u014dmon|city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.<ref>Richie, ''Rashomon'', p 113.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film: \"Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.\" Regarding ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa said, \"I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"<ref>[[Donald Richie]], ''The Films of Akira Kurosawa''.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon]] gate, the woods, and the [[courtyard]]. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the [[woodland]] is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa got from Daiei.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Kurosawa shot ''Rashomon'', the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls, \"We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing ''Rashomon'' every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed\".<ref>Qtd. in Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[cinematographer]], [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.<ref>''The World of Kazuo Miyagawa'' (original title: ''The Camera Also Acts: Movie Cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo'') director unknown. NHK, year unknown. Television/Criterion blu-ray</ref>\n\nUse of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in ''Rashomon''. According to [[Donald Richie]], the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.<ref>Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n''Rashomon'' had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon|accessdate=21 December 2012|author=Akira Kurosawa|quote=when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it.}}</ref>\n\n====Lighting====\n[[Robert Altman]] compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity.<ref>Altman, Robert. One typical example from the movie which shows the ambiguity of the characters is when the bandit and the wife talk to each other in the woods, the light falls on the person who is not talking and shows the amused expressions, this represents the ambiguity present. \"Altman Introduction to Rashomon\", Criterion Collection DVD, Rashomon.</ref> In his essay \"Rashomon\", [[Tadao Sato]] suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's ''Rashomon''\". McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\n===Editing===\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] writes in ''The Impact of Rashomon'' that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully, as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; [[Donald Richie]] says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves\".\n\n===Music===\nThe film was scored by [[Fumio Hayasaka]], who is among the most respected of Japanese composers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406802357.html |title=Hayasaka, Fumio&nbsp;\u2013 Dictionary definition of Hayasaka, Fumio &#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> At the director's request, he included an adaptation of \"[[Bol\u00e9ro]]\" by [[Maurice Ravel]], especially during the woman's story.<ref name=kurosawa>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon |title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon&nbsp;\u2014 From the Current&nbsp;\u2014 The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |date=2002-02-25 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer [[Iwao \u014ctani]] added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.<ref>Teruyo Nogami, ''Waiting on the Weather: Making Movies with Akira Kurosawa'', Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 1 September 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|1933330090}}.</ref>\n\n==Allegorical and symbolic content==\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her [[samurai]] husband through the widely differing accounts of four [[witness]]es, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are [[Unreliable narrator|mutually contradictory]] and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television uses of the \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" focus on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\n\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, ''Rashomon'' has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of ''Rashomon''\" in the December 1954 issue of the ''Antioch Review'', is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements.<ref>The article has since appeared in some subsequent ''Rashomon'' anthologies, including ''Focus on Rashomon'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724] in 1972 and ''Rashomon (Rutgers Film in Print)'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798] in 1987.

It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"[[In a Grove]]\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts.\n\nSymbolism runs rampant throughout the film and much has been written on the subject. Bucking tradition, Miyagawa directly filmed the sun through the leaves of the trees, as if to show the light of truth becoming obscured.\n\n==Release==\n''Rashomon'' was released in Japan on August 24, 1950.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}} It was released theatrically in the United States by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Japanese critical responses===\nAlthough it won two Japanese awards and performed well at the domestic box office,<ref>{{cite book |last=Richie |first=Donald |date=2001 |title=A Hundred Years of Japanese Film.

However, [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival and won both the Italian Critics Award and the [[Golden Lion]] award\u2014introducing western audiences, including western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.\"<ref>{{cite web| title = Rashomon| URL = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rashomon| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| publisher = [[Flixster]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> In [[Time Out New York]], [[Andrew Johnston (critic)]] observed, \"''Rashomon'' is probably familiar even to those who haven't seen it, since in movie jargon, the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view. There's much more than that to the film, of course.

The [[Rashomon effect]] is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a woodcutter ({{lang|ja|\u6728\u6a35\u308a}}; ''Kikori'', played by [[Takashi Shimura]]) and a priest ({{lang|ja|\u65c5\u6cd5\u5e2b}}; ''Tabi H\u014dshi'', [[Minoru Chiaki]]) sitting beneath the [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon city gate]] to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest.  As he testifies he first found a woman\u2019s hat (which belonged to the wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to the bandit), then cut rope (which had bound the husband), then an amulet, and finally he came upon the body. Upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife travelling the same day the murder happened. Both men are then summoned to testify in court, where they meet the captured bandit Taj\u014dmaru ({{lang|ja|\u591a\u8944\u4e38}}), who claims to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpses her in the forest.\n\n===The bandit's story===\nTaj\u014dmaru ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), a notorious outlaw, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but eventually was seduced by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj\u014dmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In Taj\u014dmaru's recollection, they fought skillfully and fiercely, with Taj\u014dmaru praising the samurai's swordsmanship.  In the end, Taj\u014dmaru was the victor, and the woman ran away after the fight. At the end of his story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife.  He says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that the dagger's pearl inlay would have made it very valuable.  He laments having left it behind.\n\n===The wife's story===\nThe samurai's wife ([[Machiko Ky\u014d]]) tells a different story to the court. She says that Taj\u014dmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her so that she would be at peace. He continued to stare at her with a look of loathing. His expression disturbed her so much that she fainted with dagger in hand. She awoke to find her husband dead with the dagger in his chest. She attempted to kill herself, but failed in all her efforts.\n\n===The samurai's story===\nThe court then hears the story of the deceased samurai ([[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]]), told through a [[Mediumship|medium]] ({{lang|ja|\u5deb\u5973}}; ''[[miko]]'', [[Noriko Honma]]). The samurai claims that, after raping his wife, Taj\u014dmaru asked her to travel with him. She accepted and asked Taj\u014dmaru to kill her husband so that she would not feel the guilt of belonging to two men. Taj\u014dmaru, shocked by this request, grabbed her, and gave the samurai a choice of letting the woman go or killing her. \"For these words alone\", the dead samurai recounted, \"I was ready to pardon his crime\". The woman fled, and Taj\u014dmaru, after attempting to recapture her, gave up and set the samurai free. The samurai then [[seppuku|killed himself]] with his wife's dagger. Later, someone removed the dagger from his chest.\n\n===The woodcutter's story===\nBack at Rash\u014dmon gate (after the trial), the woodcutter states to the commoner that all three stories were falsehoods. The woodcutter says he witnessed the rape and murder, but that he declined the opportunity to testify at the trial because he did not want to get involved. According to the woodcutter's new story, Taj\u014dmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him, but the woman instead freed her husband. The husband was initially unwilling to fight Taj\u014dmaru, saying he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman, but the woman then criticized both him and Taj\u014dmaru, saying they were not real men and that a real man would fight for a woman's love. She urged the men to fight one another, but then hid her face in fear once they raised swords; the men, too, were visibly fearful as they began fighting. In the woodcutter's recollection, the resulting duel was far more pitiful and clumsy than Taj\u014dmaru had recounted previously, with the men constantly tripping and flailing their swords wildly. Taj\u014dmaru ultimately won through a stroke of luck. After some hesitation, he killed the samurai, and the woman subsequently fled. Taj\u014dmaru could not catch her, but took the samurai's sword and left the scene limping.\n\n===Climax===\nAt the gate, the woodcutter, priest, and commoner are interrupted from their discussion of the woodcutter's account by the sound of a crying baby. They find the baby abandoned in a basket, and the commoner takes a kimono and an amulet that have been left for the baby. The woodcutter reproaches the commoner for stealing from the abandoned baby, but the commoner chastises him. Having deduced that the reason the woodcutter did not speak up at the trial was because he was the one who stole the dagger from the scene of the murder, the commoner mocks him as \"a bandit calling another a bandit\". The commoner leaves Rash\u014dmon, claiming that all men are motivated only by [[psychological egoism|self-interest]].\n\nThese deceptions and lies shake the priest's faith in humanity. He claims it is restored when the woodcutter reaches for the baby in the priest's arms. The priest is suspicious at first, but the woodcutter explains that he intends to take care of the baby along with his own six children. This simple revelation recasts the woodcutter's story and the subsequent theft of the dagger in a new light. The priest gives the baby to the woodcutter, saying that the woodcutter has given him reason to continue having hope in humanity. The film closes on the woodcutter, walking home with the baby. The rain has stopped and the clouds have opened revealing the sun in contrast to the beginning where it was overcast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kikori, the wood cutter\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tabi H\u014dshi, the priest\n* Kichijiro Ueda as the listener, a common person\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as the Samurai\u2019s wife\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as the Samurai, the husband\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as [[Miko]], the medium\n* [[Daisuke Kat\u014d]] as Houben, the policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former [[Raj\u014dmon|city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.<ref>Richie, ''Rashomon'', p 113.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film: \"Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.\" Regarding ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa said, \"I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"<ref>[[Donald Richie]], ''The Films of Akira Kurosawa''.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon]] gate, the woods, and the [[courtyard]]. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the [[woodland]] is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa got from Daiei.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Kurosawa shot ''Rashomon'', the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls, \"We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing ''Rashomon'' every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed\".<ref>Qtd. in Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[cinematographer]], [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.<ref>''The World of Kazuo Miyagawa'' (original title: ''The Camera Also Acts: Movie Cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo'') director unknown. NHK, year unknown. Television/Criterion blu-ray</ref>\n\nUse of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in ''Rashomon''. According to [[Donald Richie]], the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.<ref>Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n''Rashomon'' had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon|accessdate=21 December 2012|author=Akira Kurosawa|quote=when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it.}}</ref>\n\n====Lighting====\n[[Robert Altman]] compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity.<ref>Altman, Robert. One typical example from the movie which shows the ambiguity of the characters is when the bandit and the wife talk to each other in the woods, the light falls on the person who is not talking and shows the amused expressions, this represents the ambiguity present. \"Altman Introduction to Rashomon\", Criterion Collection DVD, Rashomon.</ref> In his essay \"Rashomon\", [[Tadao Sato]] suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's ''Rashomon''\". McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\n===Editing===\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] writes in ''The Impact of Rashomon'' that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully, as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; [[Donald Richie]] says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves\".\n\n===Music===\nThe film was scored by [[Fumio Hayasaka]], who is among the most respected of Japanese composers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406802357.html |title=Hayasaka, Fumio&nbsp;\u2013 Dictionary definition of Hayasaka, Fumio &#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> At the director's request, he included an adaptation of \"[[Bol\u00e9ro]]\" by [[Maurice Ravel]], especially during the woman's story.<ref name=kurosawa>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon |title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon&nbsp;\u2014 From the Current&nbsp;\u2014 The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |date=2002-02-25 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer [[Iwao \u014ctani]] added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.<ref>Teruyo Nogami, ''Waiting on the Weather: Making Movies with Akira Kurosawa'', Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 1 September 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|1933330090}}.</ref>\n\n==Allegorical and symbolic content==\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her [[samurai]] husband through the widely differing accounts of four [[witness]]es, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are [[Unreliable narrator|mutually contradictory]] and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television uses of the \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" focus on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\n\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, ''Rashomon'' has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of ''Rashomon''\" in the December 1954 issue of the ''Antioch Review'', is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements.<ref>The article has since appeared in some subsequent ''Rashomon'' anthologies, including ''Focus on Rashomon'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724] in 1972 and ''Rashomon (Rutgers Film in Print)'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798] in 1987.

It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"[[In a Grove]]\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts.\n\nSymbolism runs rampant throughout the film and much has been written on the subject. Bucking tradition, Miyagawa directly filmed the sun through the leaves of the trees, as if to show the light of truth becoming obscured.\n\n==Release==\n''Rashomon'' was released in Japan on August 24, 1950.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}} It was released theatrically in the United States by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Japanese critical responses===\nAlthough it won two Japanese awards and performed well at the domestic box office,<ref>{{cite book |last=Richie |first=Donald |date=2001 |title=A Hundred Years of Japanese Film.

However, [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival and won both the Italian Critics Award and the [[Golden Lion]] award\u2014introducing western audiences, including western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10.
