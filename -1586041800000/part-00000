He is very popular within the villages. He is one of the [[Kaaval Dheivam]]s Of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. He is special among the Kaaval Dheivams, in that he is the son of Goddess [[Ankalamma|Angala Parameswari]]. In most of the temples, he is sitting on the right lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari. He is also said to be her guard.\n\n== Introduction ==\nOnce [[Shakthi]] was reborn as [[Parvati]]. As [[Brahma]] also had five heads, Parvati mistook him for [[Shiva]] and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized the truth, she was very angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. So Shiva as \"[[Rudra]]\" cut off one of Brahma's heads. This became a [[Brahmahathi Dosha]]. The four headed Brahma cursed Shiva decreeing that the fifth head would become attached to Shiva's hand and that hereafter Shiva would suffer from hunger, and would be unable to sleep. So, Lord Shiva came to earth and roamed everywhere. When he was hungry, he begged and ate, but half of the food he begged was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma: that is, the \"Kabala\" so Shiva roamed in every graveyard and slept in the ashes.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.]]\n\nShiva, due to Brahma's curse, was begging for food. During this period, Pethandavan was a leader for Kalvikkadu. His job was to do robbery in other places and serve his people. Pethandavan was rich and powerful but he was suffering because he didn't have any children. So Pethandavan and his wife Pethandachi prayed Lord Shiva for child boons. Shiva came to his house for food, and Pethandachi was mesmerized that she couldn't believe that the person who is standing next to her was a beggar. She found a God's thing on his face. By answering her prayers, Lord Shiva in beggar form gave her a Prasadam, asked to eat and said, \"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become world famous\" and went.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.]]\n\n== Pavadairayan's appearance ==\nAs said, Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a male child. They named him \"Kalvikaathaan\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu). With all their joy, they treated the child as a gift of god. At the age of 5, they put him in learning all the arts. He attained high skills in learning arts and skills. As time passed, Pethandavan become old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region. But Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they do robbery, kill lives, and incline residents and serve his people. He decided to tell his father that he was not interested but Pethandavan did not take up his words. So out of anger and no way he started to take a walk away from his region. He walked far away from his town.\n\nAs the time passed, the sun set and the darkness prevailed. Being a child, he was shouting in anger and afraid. The day was Amavasai. He saw the shape of a flame and got afraid. He asked, \"who is this?\" The flame replied, \"My son, I am Goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\"\n\n== Goddess Angalaparameswari's order ==\n\"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple needs to be constructed for me within tomorrow morning i.e., within Amavasai. But for this, you need to do certain things. As per the instructions given by Goddess Angala Parameswari, Kalvikaththaan completed all his difficult tasks and submitted in the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\" She was very happy with his son's dedication to her. She asked him one more thing. She asked him to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated on the paavadai.\n[[File:Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!.jpg|alt=Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!|thumb|Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!]]\n\n== Pavadairayan as family deity ==\nGoddess Angala Parameswari was very much happy. She took him up and kissed him so that he got Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever i have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\" Since this time, Goddess Angala Parameswari, Lord Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people.\n\nIn Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan (Lord Siva) was sitting next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. And at outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi, facing the Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman blessing their devotees.\n\n== Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar ==\nThere is another story on Lord Pavadairayan. Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, and instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy.

Out of lust, 5 children's born in the earth - vallala kandan and 4 sons. They gave trouble to Devas all the day. To solve this, sage Naradar came and confused Vallala Kandan to meditate on Lord Shiva to be the most powerful man in the world. He took his advice and started to meditate on Lord Shiva. Pleased on his devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him and asked for the boons. He asked Lord Shiva itself to be born as his son on his wife's womb. Once the lord shiva in the womb is born, lord shiva in the Kailash must be dead. Lord shiva accepted his wish and grant him with such boons. Vallala Kandan's wife conceived immediately. The child started to grow in the womb.\n\nGoddess Shakthi, the wife of Lord Shiva, was very much shocked for such boons granted for Vallala Kadan as she will tend to lose his husband. So she immediately ran for a help to her brother Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu advised her that \"you have only one chance that too during the time of birth of the child.\" Goddess Shakthi waited for the moment to destroy the child in the womb itself. Nearing the ten months, Vallala Kandan's wife is shouting out of pain. During this time, Lord Vishnu disappeared all the humans in the earth except Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. So Vallala Kandan was struggling for a women to take care of his wife and to deliver the baby safely. Goddess Angalaparameswari disguised as an old lady and Lord Pavadairayan as a small boy appeared before Vallala Kandan. Vallala Kandan approached the old lady to deliver the baby safely. She accepted that she will help in delivering the baby.\n\nVallala Kandan promised the old lady that he will give whatever she wish. The old lady asked for a knife and somethings. Vallala Kandan had a doubt on giving knife but gave as to deliver the baby. The old lady took Vallala Kandan's wife to a separate place and asked Pavadairayan to stand outside as a protector for her. Goddess Angalaparameswari as an old lady, utilized this opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, goddess Angalaparameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. As per her order, Lord Pavadairayan along with Lord Veerabathrar killed Vallala Kandan and his four brothers.\n\n== Speciality ==\nUsually in the system of Kaval Dheivam, the deities will be outside the sannadhi of the main god.

Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was in jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell at Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. But for being arrested Lord Shiva, it became Profanity. So in order to overcome the profanity, Lord Shiva advised to Pavadairayan, \"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri (Now its Thiruvottriyur), nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, in an apparition form, sitting in the shadow of a palm tree and ruling that place. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then your relieve from profanity.\n\nAs obeyed by Pavadairayan on Lord Shiva's words, he went to the Palmgrove where Goddess Kali is ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan was very happy to hear Goddess Kali's gelastic. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter. Goddess Kali accepted Pavadairayan on his worship. So after that, Pavadairayan brought all his people, forces, troops to the place where Goddess Kali ruled and lived as a protector for her.\n\nThe place where Lord Pavadairayan and his people lived, is called as \"[[Rayampuram|Rayanpuram]]\".

He is very popular within the villages. He is one of the [[Kaaval Dheivam]]s Of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. He is special among the Kaaval Dheivams, in that he is the son of Goddess [[Ankalamma|Angala Parameswari]]. In most of the temples, he is sitting on the right lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari. He is also said to be her guard.\n\n== Introduction ==\nOnce [[Shakthi]] was reborn as [[Parvati]]. As [[Brahma]] also had five heads, Parvati mistook him for [[Shiva]] and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized the truth, she was very angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. So Shiva as \"[[Rudra]]\" cut off one of Brahma's heads. This became a [[Brahmahathi Dosha]]. The four headed Brahma cursed Shiva decreeing that the fifth head would become attached to Shiva's hand and that hereafter Shiva would suffer from hunger, and would be unable to sleep. So, Lord Shiva came to earth and roamed everywhere. When he was hungry, he begged and ate, but half of the food he begged was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma: that is, the \"Kabala\" so Shiva roamed in every graveyard and slept in the ashes.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.]]\n\nShiva, due to Brahma's curse, was begging for food. During this period, Pethandavan was a leader for Kalvikkadu. His job was to do robbery in other places and serve his people. Pethandavan was rich and powerful but he was suffering because he didn't have any children. So Pethandavan and his wife Pethandachi prayed Lord Shiva for child boons. Shiva came to his house for food, and Pethandachi was mesmerized that she couldn't believe that the person who is standing next to her was a beggar. She found a God's thing on his face. By answering her prayers, Lord Shiva in beggar form gave her a Prasadam, asked to eat and said, \"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become world famous\" and went.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.]]\n\n== Pavadairayan's appearance ==\nAs said, Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a male child. They named him \"Kalvikaathaan\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu). With all their joy, they treated the child as a gift of god. At the age of 5, they put him in learning all the arts. He attained high skills in learning arts and skills. As time passed, Pethandavan become old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region. But Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they do robbery, kill lives, and incline residents and serve his people. He decided to tell his father that he was not interested but Pethandavan did not take up his words. So out of anger and no way he started to take a walk away from his region. He walked far away from his town.\n\nAs the time passed, the sun set and the darkness prevailed. Being a child, he was shouting in anger and afraid. The day was Amavasai. He saw the shape of a flame and got afraid. He asked, \"who is this?\" The flame replied, \"My son, I am Goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\"\n\n== Goddess Angalaparameswari's order ==\n\"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple need to be constructed for me within tomorrow morning i.e., within Amavasai. But for this, you need to do certain things. As per the instructions given by Goddess Angala Parameswari, Kalvikaththaan completed all his difficult tasks and submitted in the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\" She was very happy on his son's dedication to her. She asked him one more thing. She asked him to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated on the paavadai.\n[[File:Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!.jpg|alt=Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!|thumb|Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!]]\n\n== Pavadairayan as family deity ==\nGoddess Angala Parameswari was very much happy. She took him up and kissed him so that he got Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever i have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\" Since this time, Goddess Angala Parameswari, Lord Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people.\n\nIn Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan (Lord Siva) was sitting next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. And at outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi, facing the Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman blessing their devotees.\n\n== Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar ==\nThere is another story on Lord Pavadairayan. Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, and instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was under jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell in Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. So Lord Shiva accepted him and blessed Pavadairayan to become the guard of Lord Shiva with his two wives. As Lord Shiva came in Paradhesi Kola (beggar form), so the temple is called as Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar Temple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://senthilvayal.com/2010/01/21/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95/comment-page-1/|title=\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0b9f\u0bbf!|date=2010-01-20|work=\u0b89\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b95|access-date=2018-06-07|language=ta-IN}}</ref>\n\n== Vallala Kandan's death ==\nLord Bramma had a lust on Thilothama.

Goddess Angalaparameswari as an old lady, utilized this opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, goddess Angalaparameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. As per her order, Lord Pavadairayan along with Lord Veerabathrar killed Vallala Kandan and his four brothers.\n\n== Speciality ==\nUsually in the system of Kaval Dheivam, the deities will be outside the sannadhi of the main god. But Lord Pavadairayan is the only Kaaval Dheivam or Parivara Moorthy who has been given a status to sit in the lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\n\n== Statue at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History ==\n[[File:Lord Ayyanar - Lord Pavadairayan.jpg|alt=Lord Aiyanar on Horse.

Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was in jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell at Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. But for being arrested Lord Shiva, it became Profanity. So in order to overcome the profanity, Lord Shiva advised to Pavadairayan, \"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri (Now its Thiruvottriyur), nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, in an apparition form, sitting in the shadow of a palm tree and ruling that place. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then your relieve from profanity.\n\nAs obeyed by Pavadairayan on Lord Shiva's words, he went to the Palmgrove where Goddess Kali is ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan was very happy to hear Goddess Kali's gelastic. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter. Goddess Kali accepted Pavadairayan on his worship. So after that, Pavadairayan brought all his people, forces, troops to the place where Goddess Kali ruled and lived as a protector for her.\n\nThe place where Lord Pavadairayan and his people lived, is called as \"[[Rayampuram|Rayanpuram]]\". After some period, it became \"Royapuram\". The place where Lord Pavadairayan served as a protector for Kali Devi is Royapuram, Kalmandapam Angalaparameswari Amman Temple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chinnuadhithya.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%99/|title=\u0b85\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bbe\u0b95\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0ba4\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0b85\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf|date=2014-02-27|work=chinnuadhithya|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Worship ==\nLord Pavadairayan is worshipped most in the form of \"Nadukal\" (worship of stones) and \"Trees\".
