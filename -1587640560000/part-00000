Among these antibodies are some which attack [[antigen]]s on the [[red blood cell]]s in the [[fetal circulation]], breaking down and destroying the cells ([[hemolysis]]). The fetus can develop [[reticulocytosis]] and [[anemia]]. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure ([[hydrops fetalis]]) can occur.  When the disease is moderate or severe, many [[erythroblast]]s (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called ''erythroblastosis fetalis'' (or ''erythroblastosis foetalis'').\n\nHDFN represents a breach of [[immune privilege]] for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the [[immune tolerance in pregnancy|immune tolerance of pregnancy]]. Various types of HDFN are classified by which alloantigen provokes the response. In order of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], the types include [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO)|ABO]], [[Rh disease|anti-RhD]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-RhE)|anti-RhE]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)|anti-Rhc]], anti-Rhe, anti-RhC, multiantigen combinations, and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|anti-Kell]].{{citation needed|reason=A reference should be provided for this order of incidence|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns of hemolytic disease of the newborn include a positive [[direct coombs test|direct Coombs test]] (also called direct agglutination test), elevated cord bilirubin levels, and [[hemolytic anemia]]. It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have [[neutropenia]] and [[neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]] as well. [[Hemolysis]] leads to elevated [[bilirubin]] levels.  After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the [[symptom]]s of [[jaundice]] (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes, or [[Jaundice|icterus]]) increase within 24 hours after birth.  Like other forms of severe [[neonatal jaundice]], there is the possibility of the neonate developing acute or chronic [[kernicterus]], however the risk of kernicterus in HDN is higher because of the rapid and massive destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output [[heart failure]], with [[pallor]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and/or [[splenomegaly|spleen]], generalized [[edema|swelling]], and [[shortness of breath|respiratory distress]].\n\nHDN can be the cause of [[hydrops fetalis]], an often-severe form of prenatal [[heart failure]] that causes fetal [[edema]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Complications===\nComplications of HDN could include [[kernicterus]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], inspissated (thickened or dried) bile syndrome and/or greenish staining of the [[teeth]], [[hemolytic anemia]] and damage to the liver due to excess bilirubin. Conditions that may cause similar symptoms in the newborn period include: [[Hemolytic anemia#Acquired|acquired hemolytic anemia]], congenital [[toxoplasma]], congenital [[syphilis]] infection, congenital obstruction of the [[bile duct]], and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection.\n\n*High at birth or rapidly rising bilirubin<ref name=pmid17337672/>\n*Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia<ref name=pmid17337672/>\n*Bilirubin Induced Neurological Dysfunction<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211157 |pmid=15578034 |title=Definition of the Clinical Spectrum of Kernicterus and Bilirubin-Induced Neurologic Dysfunction (BIND) |journal=Journal of Perinatology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=54\u20139 |year=2004 |last1=Shapiro |first1=Steven M }}</ref>\n*Cerebral Palsy<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.siny.2005.10.010 |pmid=16338186 |title=Epidemiology of cerebral palsy |journal=Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=117\u201325 |year=2006 |last1=Blair |first1=Eve |last2=Watson |first2=Linda }}</ref>\n*Kernicterus<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(48)80225-8 |pmid=18866937 |title=Clinical signs and development of survivors of kernicterus due to Rh sensitization |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=693\u2013705 |year=1948 |last1=Lande |first1=Lottie }}</ref>\n*Neutropenia<ref name=pmid2494315/><ref name=pmid14413526>{{cite journal |pmid=14413526 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14413526 |year=1960 |last1=Lalezari |first1=P |title=Neonatal neutropenia due to maternal isoimmunization |journal=Blood |volume=15 |pages=236\u201343 |last2=Nussbaum |first2=M |last3=Gelman |first3=S |last4=Spaet |first4=T.

If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it ''in utero'' and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i.e., produces IgG [[antibodies]] against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility.\n\n[[Fetal-maternal hemorrhage]], which is the movement of fetal blood cells across the placenta, can occur during [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], ruptures in the [[placenta]] during [[pregnancy]] (often caused by trauma), or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the [[red blood cell]]s and cause their destruction ([[hemolysis]]). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood, and 15-50% of pregnancies have hemorrhages with the potential for immune sensitization. The amount of fetal blood needed to cause maternal sensitization depends on the individual's immune system and ranges from 0.1 mL to 30 mL.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arraut|first=Amaryllis|date=2017-03-09|title=Erythrocyte Alloimmunization and Pregnancy: Overview, Background, Pathophysiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273995-overview#showall|journal=Medscape|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe woman may have received a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]]. [[ABO|ABO blood group system]] and the D antigen of the [[Rh blood group system|Rhesus (Rh) blood group system]] typing are routine prior to transfusion.  Suggestions have been made that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or [[Kell antigen system|Kell<sub>1</sub>]]-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups.  HDFN can also be caused by antibodies to a variety of other [[blood group system]] antigens, but Kell and Rh are the most frequently encountered.\n\nThe third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The [[immune response]] to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life.  Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of \"ABO disease.\" About 15% of pregnancies involve a type O mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens.{{Citation needed|reason=Generally need citations in this section, but starting with this recent edit.|date=July 2014}} In cases where there is ABO incompatibility and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Antibody specific===\n*Anti-D is the only preventable form of HDN. Since the 1968 introduction of Rho-D immunoglobulin, ([[Rho(D) immune globulin|Rhogam]]), which prevents the production of maternal Rho-D antibodies, the incidence of anti-D HDN has decreased dramatically.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0973-6247.75963 |pmid=21572705 |pmc=3082712 |title=Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn: Current trends and perspectives |journal=Asian Journal of Transfusion Science |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3\u20137 |year=2011 |last1=Basu |first1=Sabita |last2=Kaur |first2=Ravneet |last3=Kaur |first3=Gagandeep }}</ref>\n*Anti-C and anti-c can both show a negative DAT but still have a severely affected infant.<ref name=pmid7655573>{{cite journal |pmid=7655573 |year=1995 |last1=Heddle |first1=N.

Among these antibodies are some which attack [[antigen]]s on the [[red blood cell]]s in the [[fetal circulation]], breaking down and destroying the cells ([[hemolysis]]). The fetus can develop [[reticulocytosis]] and [[anemia]]. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure ([[hydrops fetalis]]) can occur.  When the disease is moderate or severe, many [[erythroblast]]s (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called ''erythroblastosis fetalis'' (or ''erythroblastosis foetalis'').\n\nHDFN represents a breach of [[immune privilege]] for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the [[immune tolerance in pregnancy|immune tolerance of pregnancy]]. Various types of HDFN are classified by which alloantigen provokes the response. In order of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], the types include [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO)|ABO]], [[Rh disease|anti-RhD]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-RhE)|anti-RhE]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)|anti-Rhc]], anti-Rhe, anti-RhC, multiantigen combinations, and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|anti-Kell]].{{citation needed|reason=A reference should be provided for this order of incidence|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns of hemolytic disease of the newborn include a positive [[direct coombs test|direct Coombs test]] (also called direct agglutination test), elevated cord bilirubin levels, and [[hemolytic anemia]]. It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have [[neutropenia]] and [[neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]] as well. [[Hemolysis]] leads to elevated [[bilirubin]] levels.  After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the [[symptom]]s of [[jaundice]] (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes, or [[Jaundice|icterus]]) increase within 24 hours after birth.  Like other forms of severe [[neonatal jaundice]], there is the possibility of the neonate developing acute or chronic [[kernicterus]], however the risk of kernicterus in HDN is higher because of the rapid and massive destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output [[heart failure]], with [[pallor]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and/or [[splenomegaly|spleen]], generalized [[edema|swelling]], and [[shortness of breath|respiratory distress]].\n\nHDN can be the cause of [[hydrops fetalis]], an often-severe form of prenatal [[heart failure]] that causes fetal [[edema]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Complications===\nComplications of HDN could include [[kernicterus]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], inspissated (thickened or dried) bile syndrome and/or greenish staining of the [[teeth]], [[hemolytic anemia]] and damage to the liver due to excess bilirubin. Conditions that may cause similar symptoms in the newborn period include: [[Hemolytic anemia#Acquired|acquired hemolytic anemia]], congenital [[toxoplasma]], congenital [[syphilis]] infection, congenital obstruction of the [[bile duct]], and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection.\n\n*High at birth or rapidly rising bilirubin<ref name=pmid17337672/>\n*Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia<ref name=pmid17337672/>\n*Bilirubin Induced Neurological Dysfunction<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211157 |pmid=15578034 |title=Definition of the Clinical Spectrum of Kernicterus and Bilirubin-Induced Neurologic Dysfunction (BIND) |journal=Journal of Perinatology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=54\u20139 |year=2004 |last1=Shapiro |first1=Steven M }}</ref>\n*Cerebral Palsy<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.siny.2005.10.010 |pmid=16338186 |title=Epidemiology of cerebral palsy |journal=Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=117\u201325 |year=2006 |last1=Blair |first1=Eve |last2=Watson |first2=Linda }}</ref>\n*Kernicterus<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(48)80225-8 |pmid=18866937 |title=Clinical signs and development of survivors of kernicterus due to Rh sensitization |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=693\u2013705 |year=1948 |last1=Lande |first1=Lottie }}</ref>\n*Neutropenia<ref name=pmid2494315/><ref name=pmid14413526>{{cite journal |pmid=14413526 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14413526 |year=1960 |last1=Lalezari |first1=P |title=Neonatal neutropenia due to maternal isoimmunization |journal=Blood |volume=15 |pages=236\u201343 |last2=Nussbaum |first2=M |last3=Gelman |first3=S |last4=Spaet |first4=T.

If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it ''in utero'' and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i.e., produces IgG [[antibodies]] against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility.\n\n[[Fetal-maternal hemorrhage]], which is the movement of fetal blood cells across the placenta, can occur during [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], ruptures in the [[placenta]] during [[pregnancy]] (often caused by trauma), or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the [[red blood cell]]s and cause their destruction ([[hemolysis]]). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood, and 15-50% of pregnancies have hemorrhages with the potential for immune sensitization. The amount of fetal blood needed to cause maternal sensitization depends on the individual's immune system and ranges from 0.1 mL to 30 mL.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arraut|first=Amaryllis|date=2017-03-09|title=Erythrocyte Alloimmunization and Pregnancy: Overview, Background, Pathophysiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273995-overview#showall|journal=Medscape|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe woman may have received a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]]. [[ABO|ABO blood group system]] and the D antigen of the [[Rh blood group system|Rhesus (Rh) blood group system]] typing are routine prior to transfusion.  Suggestions have been made that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or [[Kell antigen system|Kell<sub>1</sub>]]-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups.  HDFN can also be caused by antibodies to a variety of other [[blood group system]] antigens, but Kell and Rh are the most frequently encountered.\n\nThe third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The [[immune response]] to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life.  Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of \"ABO disease.\" About 15% of pregnancies involve a type O mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens.{{Citation needed|reason=Generally need citations in this section, but starting with this recent edit.|date=July 2014}} In cases where there is ABO incompatibility and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Antibody specific===\n*Anti-D is the only preventable form of HDN.

Is any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? ... It is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.\n\nNow, your Honor, I have spoken about the war. I believed in it. I don't know whether I was crazy or not. Sometimes I think perhaps I was. I approved of it; I joined in the general cry of madness and despair. I urged men to fight. I was safe because I was too old to go. I was like the rest. What did they do? Right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable \u2013 which I need not discuss today \u2013 it changed the world. For four long years the civilized world was engaged in killing men. Christian against Christian, barbarian uniting with Christians to kill Christians; anything to kill. It was taught in every school, aye in the Sunday schools. The little children played at war. The toddling children on the street. Do you suppose this world has ever been the same since? How long, your Honor, will it take for the world to get back the humane emotions that were slowly growing before the war? How long will it take the calloused hearts of men before the scars of hatred and cruelty shall be removed?\n\nWe read of killing one hundred thousand men in a day. We read about it and we rejoiced in it\u2014if it was the other fellows who were killed. We were fed on flesh and drank blood. Even down to the prattling babe. I need not tell you how many upright, honorable young boys have come into this court charged with murder, some saved and some sent to their death, boys who fought in this war and learned to place a cheap value on human life. You know it and I know it. These boys were brought up in it. The tales of death were in their homes, their playgrounds, their schools; they were in the newspapers that they read; it was a part of the common frenzy \u2013 what was a life? It was nothing. It was the least sacred thing in existence and these boys were trained to this cruelty.\n\nIt will take fifty years to wipe it out of the human heart, if ever. I know this, that after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, crimes of this sort increased, marvelously. No one needs to tell me that crime has no cause. It has as definite a cause as any other disease, and I know that out of the hatred and bitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before. I know that Europe is going through the same experience today; I know it has followed every war; and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would have been if the world had not made red with blood. I protest against the crimes and mistakes of society being visited upon them. All of us have a share in it. I have mine. I cannot tell and I shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love and kindness and charity.\n\nYour Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the war. Not necessarily by those who fought but by those that learned that blood was cheap, and human life was cheap, and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy? There are causes for this terrible crime. There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the world. War is a part of it; education is a part of it; birth is a part of it; money is a part of it\u2014all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys.\n\nHas the court any right to consider anything but these two boys? The State says that your Honor has a right to consider the welfare of the community, as you have. If the welfare of the community would be benefited by taking these lives, well and good. I think it would work evil that no one could measure. Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these defendants? I have been sorry, and I am sorry for the bereavement of Mr. and Mrs. Franks, for those broken ties that cannot be healed. All I can hope and wish is that some good may come from it all. But as compared with the families of Leopold and Loeb, the Franks are to be envied\u2014and everyone knows it.\n\nI do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. I hate to say it in their presence, but what is there to look forward to? I do not know but what your Honor would be merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die; merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind. To spend the balance of their days in prison is mighty little to look forward to, if anything. Is it anything? They may have the hope that as the years roll around they might be released. I do not know. I do not know. I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys are not fit to be at large. I believe they will not be until they pass through the next stage of life, at forty-five or fifty. Whether they will then, I cannot tell. I am sure of this; that I will not be here to help them. So far as I am concerned, it is over.\n\nI would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time, when life and age have changed their bodies, as they do, and have changed their emotions, as they do\u2014that they may once more return to life. I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any human being that lives, and least of all to my clients. But what have they to look forward to? Nothing. And I think here of the stanza of [[A. E. Housman|Housman]]:\n\n{{poemquote|\nNow hollow fires burn out to black, / And lights are fluttering low:\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack / And leave your friends and go.\nO never fear, lads, naught's to dread, / Look not left nor right:\nIn all the endless road you tread / There's nothing but the night.}}\n\nI care not, your Honor, whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joliet close upon them, there is nothing but the night, and that is little for any human being to expect.\n\nBut there are others to consider. Here are these two families, who have led honest lives, who will bear the name that they bear, and future generations must carry it on.\n\nHere is Leopold's father \u2013 and this boy was the pride of his life. He watched him, he cared for him, he worked for him; the boy was brilliant and accomplished, he educated him, and he thought that fame and position awaited him, as it should have awaited. It is a hard thing for a father to see his life's hopes crumble into dust.\n\nShould he be considered? Should his brothers be considered? Will it do society any good or make your life safer, or any human being's life safer, if it should be handed down from generation to generation, that this boy, their kin, died upon the scaffold?\n\nAnd Loeb's the same. Here are the faithful uncle and brother, who have watched here day by day, while Dickie's father and his mother are too ill to stand this terrific strain, and shall be waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me. Shall these be taken into account in this general bereavement?\n\nHave they any rights? Is there any reason, your Honor, why their proud names and all the future generations that bear them shall have this bar sinister written across them? How many boys and girls, how many unborn children will feel it? It is bad enough as it is, God knows. It is bad enough, however it is. But it's not yet death on the scaffold. It's not that. And I ask your Honor, in addition to all that I have said to save two honorable families from a disgrace that never ends, and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives.\n\nNow, I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it long ago. None of us are unmindful of the public; courts are not, and juries are not. We placed our fate in the hands of a trained court, thinking that he would be more mindful and considerate than a jury. I cannot say how people feel. I have stood here for three months as one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide. I hope the seas are subsiding and the wind is falling, and I believe they are, but I wish to make no false pretense to this court. The easy thing and the popular thing to do is to hang my clients. I know it. Men and women who do not think will applaud. The cruel and thoughtless will approve. It will be easy today; but in Chicago, and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land, more and more fathers and mothers, the humane, the kind and the hopeful, who are gaining an understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys, but about their own \u2013 these will join in no acclaim at the death of my clients.\n\nThese would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped, and that the normal feelings of man resume their sway. And as the days and the months and the years go on, they will ask it more and more. But, your Honor, what they shall ask may not count. I know the easy way. I know the future is with me, and what I stand for here; not merely for the lives of these two unfortunate lads, but for all boys and all girls; for all of the young, and as far as possible, for all of the old. I am pleading for life, understanding, charity, kindness, and the infinite mercy that considers all. I am pleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love. I know the future is on my side. Your Honor stands between the past and the future. You may hang these boys; you may hang them by the neck until they are dead. But in doing it you will turn your face toward the past. In doing it you are making it harder for every other boy who in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood knows. In doing it you will make it harder for unborn children. You may save them and make it easier for every child that sometime may stand where these boys stand. You will make it easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate. I am pleading for the future; I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men. When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding and faith that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of man.\n\nI feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken. This case may not be as important as I think it is, and I am sure I do not need to tell this court, or to tell my friends that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich. If I should succeed, my greatest reward and my greatest hope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod\u2014that I have done something to help human understanding, to temper justice with mercy, to overcome hate with love.\n\nI was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, [[Omar Khayyam]]. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision. I wish it was in my heart, and I wish it was in the hearts of all:\n\n{{poemquote|\nSo I be written in the Book of Love,\nI do not care about that Book above.\nErase my name or write it as you will,\nSo I be written in the Book of Love.}}\n}}\n\nThe judge was persuaded, though according to his ruling, his decision was based on precedent and the youth of the accused; after 12 days on September 10, 1924, he sentenced both Leopold and Loeb to life imprisonment for the murder, and an additional 99 years for the kidnapping.<ref name=\"AmExper\" /><ref name=\"geis\" /> A little over a month later, Loeb's father died of [[heart failure]].<ref>''Daily Illini'', University of Illinois, October 28, 1924</ref>\n\n== Prison ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12794, Nathan Leopold und Richard Loeb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Leopold (top) and Loeb (bottom)]]\n\nLeopold and Loeb were initially held at [[Joliet Prison]].

He became a model prisoner and made multiple significant contributions to improving conditions at Stateville Penitentiary. These included reorganizing the prison library, revamping the schooling system and teaching its students, and volunteer work in the prison hospital. In 1944, Leopold volunteered for the [[Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study]]; he was deliberately inoculated with [[malaria]] pathogens and then subjected to multiple experimental malaria treatments.<ref>Higdon, H.

Leopold responded that he did not wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. \n\nThe novel, titled ''Compulsion'',<ref>Levin, M. ''Compulsion''(1956). New York, Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0786703199}}</ref> was published in 1956. Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him \"physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience.\"<ref>''In Nathan Leopold's Own Words''.

Is any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? ... It is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.\n\nNow, your Honor, I have spoken about the war. I believed in it. I don't know whether I was crazy or not. Sometimes I think perhaps I was. I approved of it; I joined in the general cry of madness and despair. I urged men to fight. I was safe because I was too old to go. I was like the rest. What did they do? Right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable \u2013 which I need not discuss today \u2013 it changed the world. For four long years the civilized world was engaged in killing men. Christian against Christian, barbarian uniting with Christians to kill Christians; anything to kill. It was taught in every school, aye in the Sunday schools. The little children played at war. The toddling children on the street. Do you suppose this world has ever been the same since? How long, your Honor, will it take for the world to get back the humane emotions that were slowly growing before the war? How long will it take the calloused hearts of men before the scars of hatred and cruelty shall be removed?\n\nWe read of killing one hundred thousand men in a day. We read about it and we rejoiced in it\u2014if it was the other fellows who were killed. We were fed on flesh and drank blood. Even down to the prattling babe. I need not tell you how many upright, honorable young boys have come into this court charged with murder, some saved and some sent to their death, boys who fought in this war and learned to place a cheap value on human life. You know it and I know it. These boys were brought up in it. The tales of death were in their homes, their playgrounds, their schools; they were in the newspapers that they read; it was a part of the common frenzy \u2013 what was a life? It was nothing. It was the least sacred thing in existence and these boys were trained to this cruelty.\n\nIt will take fifty years to wipe it out of the human heart, if ever. I know this, that after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, crimes of this sort increased, marvelously. No one needs to tell me that crime has no cause. It has as definite a cause as any other disease, and I know that out of the hatred and bitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before. I know that Europe is going through the same experience today; I know it has followed every war; and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would have been if the world had not made red with blood. I protest against the crimes and mistakes of society being visited upon them. All of us have a share in it. I have mine. I cannot tell and I shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love and kindness and charity.\n\nYour Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the war. Not necessarily by those who fought but by those that learned that blood was cheap, and human life was cheap, and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy? There are causes for this terrible crime. There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the world. War is a part of it; education is a part of it; birth is a part of it; money is a part of it\u2014all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys.\n\nHas the court any right to consider anything but these two boys? The State says that your Honor has a right to consider the welfare of the community, as you have. If the welfare of the community would be benefited by taking these lives, well and good. I think it would work evil that no one could measure. Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these defendants? I have been sorry, and I am sorry for the bereavement of Mr. and Mrs. Franks, for those broken ties that cannot be healed. All I can hope and wish is that some good may come from it all. But as compared with the families of Leopold and Loeb, the Franks are to be envied\u2014and everyone knows it.\n\nI do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. I hate to say it in their presence, but what is there to look forward to? I do not know but what your Honor would be merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die; merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind. To spend the balance of their days in prison is mighty little to look forward to, if anything. Is it anything? They may have the hope that as the years roll around they might be released. I do not know. I do not know. I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys are not fit to be at large. I believe they will not be until they pass through the next stage of life, at forty-five or fifty. Whether they will then, I cannot tell. I am sure of this; that I will not be here to help them. So far as I am concerned, it is over.\n\nI would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time, when life and age have changed their bodies, as they do, and have changed their emotions, as they do\u2014that they may once more return to life. I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any human being that lives, and least of all to my clients. But what have they to look forward to? Nothing. And I think here of the stanza of [[A. E. Housman|Housman]]:\n\n{{poemquote|\nNow hollow fires burn out to black, / And lights are fluttering low:\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack / And leave your friends and go.\nO never fear, lads, naught's to dread, / Look not left nor right:\nIn all the endless road you tread / There's nothing but the night.}}\n\nI care not, your Honor, whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joliet close upon them, there is nothing but the night, and that is little for any human being to expect.\n\nBut there are others to consider. Here are these two families, who have led honest lives, who will bear the name that they bear, and future generations must carry it on.\n\nHere is Leopold's father \u2013 and this boy was the pride of his life. He watched him, he cared for him, he worked for him; the boy was brilliant and accomplished, he educated him, and he thought that fame and position awaited him, as it should have awaited. It is a hard thing for a father to see his life's hopes crumble into dust.\n\nShould he be considered? Should his brothers be considered? Will it do society any good or make your life safer, or any human being's life safer, if it should be handed down from generation to generation, that this boy, their kin, died upon the scaffold?\n\nAnd Loeb's the same. Here are the faithful uncle and brother, who have watched here day by day, while Dickie's father and his mother are too ill to stand this terrific strain, and shall be waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me. Shall these be taken into account in this general bereavement?\n\nHave they any rights? Is there any reason, your Honor, why their proud names and all the future generations that bear them shall have this bar sinister written across them? How many boys and girls, how many unborn children will feel it? It is bad enough as it is, God knows. It is bad enough, however it is. But it's not yet death on the scaffold. It's not that. And I ask your Honor, in addition to all that I have said to save two honorable families from a disgrace that never ends, and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives.\n\nNow, I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it long ago. None of us are unmindful of the public; courts are not, and juries are not. We placed our fate in the hands of a trained court, thinking that he would be more mindful and considerate than a jury. I cannot say how people feel. I have stood here for three months as one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide. I hope the seas are subsiding and the wind is falling, and I believe they are, but I wish to make no false pretense to this court. The easy thing and the popular thing to do is to hang my clients. I know it. Men and women who do not think will applaud. The cruel and thoughtless will approve. It will be easy today; but in Chicago, and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land, more and more fathers and mothers, the humane, the kind and the hopeful, who are gaining an understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys, but about their own \u2013 these will join in no acclaim at the death of my clients.\n\nThese would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped, and that the normal feelings of man resume their sway. And as the days and the months and the years go on, they will ask it more and more. But, your Honor, what they shall ask may not count. I know the easy way. I know the future is with me, and what I stand for here; not merely for the lives of these two unfortunate lads, but for all boys and all girls; for all of the young, and as far as possible, for all of the old. I am pleading for life, understanding, charity, kindness, and the infinite mercy that considers all. I am pleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love. I know the future is on my side. Your Honor stands between the past and the future. You may hang these boys; you may hang them by the neck until they are dead. But in doing it you will turn your face toward the past. In doing it you are making it harder for every other boy who in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood knows. In doing it you will make it harder for unborn children. You may save them and make it easier for every child that sometime may stand where these boys stand. You will make it easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate. I am pleading for the future; I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men. When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding and faith that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of man.\n\nI feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken. This case may not be as important as I think it is, and I am sure I do not need to tell this court, or to tell my friends that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich. If I should succeed, my greatest reward and my greatest hope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod\u2014that I have done something to help human understanding, to temper justice with mercy, to overcome hate with love.\n\nI was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, [[Omar Khayyam]]. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision.

He became a model prisoner and made multiple significant contributions to improving conditions at Stateville Penitentiary. These included reorganizing the prison library, revamping the schooling system and teaching its students, and volunteer work in the prison hospital.

Leopold responded that he did not wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. \n\nThe novel, titled ''Compulsion'',<ref>Levin, M. ''Compulsion''(1956). New York, Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0786703199}}</ref> was published in 1956. Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him \"physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside.

Large organizations that supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded, which led the defense industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q, and Def Stan standards. Eventually, industries adopted ISO 9000 instead of forcing contractors to adopt multiple\u2014and often similar\u2014requirements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stamatis|first1=D H|title=Understanding ISO 9000 and Implementing the Basics to Quality|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1YGfv04PdS0C&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=Def+Stan+05-21+and+05-24#v=onepage&q=Def%20Stan%2005-21%20and%2005-24&f=false|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=14 February 2018|isbn=9780824796563|date=8 August 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for use==\nThe global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to a number of factors. In the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be used by procuring organizations{{Clarify|reason=Procuring what? Customers?|date=April 2019}}, as the basis of contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for \"supplier development\"{{Vague|date=April 2019}} by establishing basic requirements for a supplier to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of product, business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing etc.) and risk to the procurer. If a chosen supplier was weak on the controls of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results, that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. The adoption of a single quality assurance requirement also leads to cost savings throughout the supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of  maintaining multiple sets of quality manuals and procedures.\n\nA few years later, the UK Government took steps to improve national competitiveness following publication of cmd 8621, and Third Party Certification of Quality Management Systems was born, under the auspices of the National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB), which has become the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).\n\nIn addition to many stakeholders' benefits, a number of studies have identified significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with an ISO analysis of 42 studies showing that implementing the standard does  enhance financial performance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manders |first1=Basak |title=DOES ISO 9001 PAY?

They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.\n\nPrinciple 3 \u2013 Engagement of people\n:People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit.\n\nPrinciple 4 \u2013 Process approach\n:A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.\n\nPrinciple 5 \u2013 Improvement\n:Improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.\n\nPrinciple 6 \u2013 Evidence-based decision making\n:Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.\n\nPrinciple 7 \u2013 Relationship management\n:An organization and its external providers (suppliers, contractors, service providers) are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Contents of ISO 9001:2015|Contents_of_ISO_9001}}==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[ISO 9001]] -->\n[[File:ISO 9001 in Tsukiji.jpg|thumb|A fish wholesaler in [[Tsukiji]], [[Japan]], advertising its ISO 9001 certification]]\n'''''ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems \u2014 Requirements''''' is a document of approximately 30 pages  available from the national standards organization in each country. Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for third-party assessment purposes.\n\nContents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:\n* Section 1: Scope\n* Section 2: Normative references\n* Section 3: Terms and definitions\n* Section 4: Context of the organization\n* Section 5: Leadership\n* Section 6: Planning\n* Section 7: Support\n* Section 8: Operation\n* Section 9: Performance evaluation\n* Section 10: Continual Improvement\n\nEssentially, the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:2008 standard in that it follows the [[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]] cycle in a process-based approach but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking (section 0.3.3 of the introduction). The purpose of the quality objectives is to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations), facilitate effective deployment and improve the quality management system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2000/nov/article/using-quality-objectives-drive-strategic-performance-improvement.html|title=Using Quality Objectives to Drive Strategic Performance Improvement|website=Qualitydigest.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isopocketguides.com/media/docs/ISO2KMAN.doc|format=DOC|title=OBJECTIVE OF THE SAMPLE MANUAL|website=Isopocketguides.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}</ref>\n\nBefore the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the requirements of sections 4 to 10.  Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into account.\n\nThe standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain documented procedures, but ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation. The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented [[quality policy]], a quality management system scope, and quality objectives<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualityze.com/blogs/a-guide-to-quality-objectives/|title=A Guide to Quality Objectives {{!}} Quality Management Systems|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>. The standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality Manual. The standard does require retention of numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard's requirements are being met, while the external auditor's role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.\n\n==Certification==\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) does not certify organisations itself. Numerous certification bodies exist, which audit organisations and upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates. Although commonly referred to as \"ISO 9000\" certification, the actual standard to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 expired around September 2018). Many countries have formed [[accreditation]] bodies to authorize (\"accredit\") the certification bodies. Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the [[accredited registrar|accredited certification bodies]] (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021,<ref>ISO/IEC 17021: \"Conformity assessment. Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems\" (2011)</ref> while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.<ref>ISO/IEC 17011: \"Conformity assessment. General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies\" (2004).</ref>\n\nAn organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services, and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as \"nonconformities\", \"observations\", or \"opportunities for improvement\") to management. If there are no major nonconformities, the certification body issues a certificate.  Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization presents an improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it issues a certificate.  The certificate is limited by a certain scope (e.g., production of golf balls) and displays the addresses to which the certificate refers.\n\nAn ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed, in accordance with ISO 17021, at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title=ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Conformity assessment \u2014 Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems \u2014 Part 1: Requirements |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/61651.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.\n\n==Evolution of ISO 9000 standards==\nThe ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals who are implementing the standard.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" font-size=95%; width=50%; background-color=transparent\n!Year\n!Edition of ISO 9001\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1987 || 1st Edition ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1994 || 2nd Edition || \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2000 || 3rd Edition || \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2008 || 4th Edition ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2015 || 5th Edition || \n|-\n|}\n\n\n===1987 version===\nISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the UK Standard BS 5750, with three \"models\" for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on the scope of activities of the organization:\n* ISO 9001:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation, and servicing'' was for companies and organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.\n* ISO 9002:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in production, installation, and servicing'' had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without covering the creation of new products.\n* ISO 9003:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test'' covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern for how the product was produced.\n''ISO 9000:1987'' was also influenced by existing U.S. and other [[Defense Standard]]s (\"MIL SPECS\"), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of management, which was likely the actual intent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===1994 version===\n''ISO 9000:1994'' emphasized [[quality assurance]] via preventive actions, instead of just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the quality system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===2000 version===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:apcer.png|250px|thumb|right|The Portuguese [[ISO 9001]] certification image]] -->\n''ISO 9001:2000'' replaced all three former standards of 1994 issue, ''ISO 9001'', ''ISO 9002'' and ''ISO 9003''. Design and development procedures were required only if a company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and centre the concept of [[process management]] (the monitoring and optimisation of a company's tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.\n\nISO 9000 Requirements include:\n* Approve documents before distribution;\n* Provide correct version of documents at points of use;\n* Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and\n* Develop a procedure to control your records.\n\n===2008 version===\n''ISO 9001:2008'' in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and some changes intended to improve consistency with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001:2004]]. There were no new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the clarifications introduced in the amended version.\n\nISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:\n* ISO 9000:2005 \"Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary\"\n* ISO 9004:2009 \"Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A quality management approach\"\nOther standards, like [[ISO 19011]] and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for specific parts of the quality system.\n\n===2015 version===\nIn 2012, ISO TC 176 - responsible for ISO 9001 development - celebrated 25 years of implementing ISO 9001<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asq.org/blog/2012/03/25-years-of-iso-9000/|title=25 Years of ISO 9000 {{!}} A View from the Q|publisher=ASQ|access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref> and concluded that it was necessary to create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as \"beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.asigurareacalitatii.ro/wp-content/uploads/83-02.pdf|title = The Standard ISO 9001:2015 - A Milestone in the Evolution of Quality Management|last = Bacivarov|first = Ioan|date = 1 October 2015|journal = Asigurarea Calitatii - Quality Assurance|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other international management systems standards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Infographic: ISO 9001:2015 vs. 2008 revision \u2013 What has changed? |url=https://maritimecyprus.com/2016/08/11/infographic-iso-90012015-vs-2008-revision-what-has-changed/ |publisher=Maritime Cyprus |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new ''ISO 9001:2015'' management system standard helps ensure that consumers get reliable, desired quality goods and services. This further increases benefits for a business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/home/standards/popular-standards/iso-9001.html|title=ISO 9001 Quality management|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>\n\nThe 2015 version is also less prescriptive than its predecessors and focuses on performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-based thinking, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref2002|title=ISO 9001:2015 - Just published!|publisher=ISO |accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome of the key changes include:\n* High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new standards released by ISO will have this high-level structure\n* Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each organization's particular needs\n* A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy\n* Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management system a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement\n* Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organisation can now decide what documented information it needs and what format it should be in\n* Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a common structure and core text<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/august/BSI-obtains-first-global-accreditation-for-the-new-Quality-Management-standard-ISO-90012015-from-ANAB/#.Vem-kxFVhBc|title=BSI obtains first global accreditation from ANAB to certify organizations to the new Quality Management standard ISO 9001:2015|publisher=BSI |accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Inclusion of Knowledge Management principles\n* Quality Manual & Management representative (MR) are no longer mandatory\n\n==Auditing==\n\nTwo types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard: auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a continual process of review and assessment to verify that the system is working as it is supposed to, to find out where it can improve, and to correct or prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors to audit outside their usual management line, so as to bring a degree of independence to their judgements.\n\n==Industry-specific interpretations==\nThe ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to make sense within a particular organization. [[Software development process|Developing software]] is not like making [[cheese]] or offering [[counseling]] services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines, because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of these.  Diverse organizations\u2014police departments (United States), professional [[soccer]] teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)\u2014have successfully implemented ISO 9001:2000 systems.\n\nOver time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardise their interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace.  This is partly to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors are sent to assess them.\n* The '''[[TickIT]]''' guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology industry, especially software development.\n* '''[[AS9000]]''' is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers include [[AlliedSignal]], [[Allison Engine]], [[Boeing]], [[General Electric Aircraft Engines]], [[Lockheed-Martin]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Rockwell-Collins]], [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], and [[Sundstrand Corporation|Sundstrand]]. The current version is '''[[AS9100]]D'''.\n* '''PS 9000''' * '''QS 9000''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] and [[Advanced Product Quality Planning|APQP]]. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.\n* '''[[ISO/TS 16949]]:2009''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements. After the new edition of ISO 9001:2015 the ISO/TS 16949:2009 was also completely revised and reissued by IATF (International Automotive Task Force). IATF 16949:2016 is now a stand-alone standard that doesn't include the ISO 9001:2015 requirements but still refers to them and works as an additional automotive-specific requirement to ISO 9001.\n* '''[[TL 9000]]''' is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, [http://www.questforum.org QuEST Forum]. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements Handbooks are 6.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL 9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer organizations. It is important to note that TL 9000 R6.0 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2015.\n* '''[[ISO 13485]]:2016''' is the medical industry's equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO 13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to medical device manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).\n* '''[[ISO/IEC 90003]]:2014''' provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to computer software.\n* '''[[ISO/TS 29001]]''' is quality management system requirements for the design, development, production, installation, and service of products for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. It is equivalent to API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.\n* '''[[ISO 22000]]''' Food Safety Management Systems.\n*[https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html ISO 17025:2017] is the Quality Management System applicable only to Testing and Calibration Laboratories.\n\n\n==Effectiveness==\n{{Original research|section|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000 commonly centres on the following questions:\n# Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?\n# Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management system?\n# Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?\n\nThe effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of factors, the most significant of which are:\n# Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality. Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire and commitment often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits.\n# How well the ISO system integrates into current business practices.  Many organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard when necessary.\n# How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience.  The broadest definition of quality is \"Whatever the customer perceives good quality to be.\"  This means that a company doesn't necessarily have to make a product that never fails; some customers have a higher tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer service.  An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a continual basis.  This means taking into account all processes that deal with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization). Only then can a company sustain improvements in the customer's experience.\n# How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement.  While ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement.  Many auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language.  Auditors that can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language and terms executive management understands facilitate action on improvement initiatives by the companies they audit.  When management doesn't understand why they were non-compliant and the business implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the reports and focus on what they do understand.\n\n===Advantages===\nProper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage, and avoidance of litigation.<ref name=\"sroufe\">Sroufe, Robert and Sime Curkovic, \"An examination of ISO 9000:2000 and supply chain quality assurance.\" Journal of Operations Management, Volume 26, Issue 4, July 2008, Pages 503-520</ref> The quality principles in ISO 9000:2000 are also sound, according to Wade <ref name=\"wade\"/> and Barnes, who says that \"ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive\".<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base, better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and communication with management.<ref name=\"sroufe\"/> According to ISO<ref>{{cite web|title=Debunking the myths|url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/iso_9001_debunking_the_myths.pdf|website=Iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> the 2015 version of the standard brings the following benefits:\n# By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.\n# Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their organization.\n# By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the organization.\n# Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and efficiency, bringing internal costs down.\n# Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements.\n# Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients require ISO 9001 before doing business.\n\n===Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification===\nA common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later when needed, ISO 9001 certification.<ref name=\"clifford\" /> Dalgleish cites the \"inordinate and often unnecessary paperwork burden\" of ISO, and says that \"quality managers feel that ISO's overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient\".<ref name=\"dalgleish 2003\">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits - ISO 9000: More Hindrance Than Help |work=Quality Magazine |date=5 May 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> The level of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly reduced, going from ISO 9001:2000 to ISO 9001:2008 to ISO 9001:2015.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAccording to Barnes, \"Opponents claim that it is only for documentation.

Large organizations that supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded, which led the defense industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q, and Def Stan standards. Eventually, industries adopted ISO 9000 instead of forcing contractors to adopt multiple\u2014and often similar\u2014requirements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stamatis|first1=D H|title=Understanding ISO 9000 and Implementing the Basics to Quality|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1YGfv04PdS0C&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=Def+Stan+05-21+and+05-24#v=onepage&q=Def%20Stan%2005-21%20and%2005-24&f=false|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=14 February 2018|isbn=9780824796563|date=8 August 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for use==\nThe global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to a number of factors. In the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be used by procuring organizations{{Clarify|reason=Procuring what? Customers?|date=April 2019}}, as the basis of contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for \"supplier development\"{{Vague|date=April 2019}} by establishing basic requirements for a supplier to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of product, business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing etc.) and risk to the procurer. If a chosen supplier was weak on the controls of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results, that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. The adoption of a single quality assurance requirement also leads to cost savings throughout the supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of  maintaining multiple sets of quality manuals and procedures.\n\nA few years later, the UK Government took steps to improve national competitiveness following publication of cmd 8621, and Third Party Certification of Quality Management Systems was born, under the auspices of the National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB), which has become the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).\n\nIn addition to many stakeholders' benefits, a number of studies have identified significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with an ISO analysis of 42 studies showing that implementing the standard does  enhance financial performance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manders |first1=Basak |title=DOES ISO 9001 PAY?

Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for third-party assessment purposes.\n\nContents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:\n* Section 1: Scope\n* Section 2: Normative references\n* Section 3: Terms and definitions\n* Section 4: Context of the organization\n* Section 5: Leadership\n* Section 6: Planning\n* Section 7: Support\n* Section 8: Operation\n* Section 9: Performance evaluation\n* Section 10: Continual Improvement\n\nEssentially, the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:2008 standard in that it follows the [[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]] cycle in a process-based approach but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking (section 0.3.3 of the introduction). The purpose of the quality objectives is to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations), facilitate effective deployment and improve the quality management system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2000/nov/article/using-quality-objectives-drive-strategic-performance-improvement.html|title=Using Quality Objectives to Drive Strategic Performance Improvement|website=Qualitydigest.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isopocketguides.com/media/docs/ISO2KMAN.doc|format=DOC|title=OBJECTIVE OF THE SAMPLE MANUAL|website=Isopocketguides.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}</ref>\n\nBefore the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the requirements of sections 4 to 10.  Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into account.\n\nThe standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain documented procedures, but ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation. The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented [[quality policy]], a quality management system scope, and quality objectives. The standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality Manual. The standard does require retention of numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard's requirements are being met, while the external auditor's role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.\n\n==Certification==\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) does not certify organisations itself. Numerous certification bodies exist, which audit organisations and upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates. Although commonly referred to as \"ISO 9000\" certification, the actual standard to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 expired around September 2018). Many countries have formed [[accreditation]] bodies to authorize (\"accredit\") the certification bodies. Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the [[accredited registrar|accredited certification bodies]] (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021,<ref>ISO/IEC 17021: \"Conformity assessment. Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems\" (2011)</ref> while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.<ref>ISO/IEC 17011: \"Conformity assessment. General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies\" (2004).</ref>\n\nAn organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services, and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as \"nonconformities\", \"observations\", or \"opportunities for improvement\") to management. If there are no major nonconformities, the certification body issues a certificate.  Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization presents an improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it issues a certificate.  The certificate is limited by a certain scope (e.g., production of golf balls) and displays the addresses to which the certificate refers.\n\nAn ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed, in accordance with ISO 17021, at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title=ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Conformity assessment \u2014 Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems \u2014 Part 1: Requirements |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/61651.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.\n\n==Evolution of ISO 9000 standards==\nThe ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals who are implementing the standard.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" font-size=95%; width=50%; background-color=transparent\n!Year\n!Edition of ISO 9001\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1987 || 1st Edition ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1994 || 2nd Edition || \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2000 || 3rd Edition || \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2008 || 4th Edition ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2015 || 5th Edition || \n|-\n|}\n\n\n===1987 version===\nISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the UK Standard BS 5750, with three \"models\" for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on the scope of activities of the organization:\n* ISO 9001:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation, and servicing'' was for companies and organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.\n* ISO 9002:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in production, installation, and servicing'' had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without covering the creation of new products.\n* ISO 9003:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test'' covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern for how the product was produced.\n''ISO 9000:1987'' was also influenced by existing U.S. and other [[Defense Standard]]s (\"MIL SPECS\"), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of management, which was likely the actual intent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===1994 version===\n''ISO 9000:1994'' emphasized [[quality assurance]] via preventive actions, instead of just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the quality system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===2000 version===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:apcer.png|250px|thumb|right|The Portuguese [[ISO 9001]] certification image]] -->\n''ISO 9001:2000'' replaced all three former standards of 1994 issue, ''ISO 9001'', ''ISO 9002'' and ''ISO 9003''. Design and development procedures were required only if a company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and centre the concept of [[process management]] (the monitoring and optimisation of a company's tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.\n\nISO 9000 Requirements include:\n* Approve documents before distribution;\n* Provide correct version of documents at points of use;\n* Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and\n* Develop a procedure to control your records.\n\n===2008 version===\n''ISO 9001:2008'' in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and some changes intended to improve consistency with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001:2004]]. There were no new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the clarifications introduced in the amended version.\n\nISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:\n* ISO 9000:2005 \"Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary\"\n* ISO 9004:2009 \"Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A quality management approach\"\nOther standards, like [[ISO 19011]] and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for specific parts of the quality system.\n\n===2015 version===\nIn 2012, ISO TC 176 - responsible for ISO 9001 development - celebrated 25 years of implementing ISO 9001<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asq.org/blog/2012/03/25-years-of-iso-9000/|title=25 Years of ISO 9000 {{!}} A View from the Q|publisher=ASQ|access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref> and concluded that it was necessary to create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as \"beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.asigurareacalitatii.ro/wp-content/uploads/83-02.pdf|title = The Standard ISO 9001:2015 - A Milestone in the Evolution of Quality Management|last = Bacivarov|first = Ioan|date = 1 October 2015|journal = Asigurarea Calitatii - Quality Assurance|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other international management systems standards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Infographic: ISO 9001:2015 vs. 2008 revision \u2013 What has changed? |url=https://maritimecyprus.com/2016/08/11/infographic-iso-90012015-vs-2008-revision-what-has-changed/ |publisher=Maritime Cyprus |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new ''ISO 9001:2015'' management system standard helps ensure that consumers get reliable, desired quality goods and services.

This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-based thinking, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref2002|title=ISO 9001:2015 - Just published!|publisher=ISO |accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome of the key changes include:\n* High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new standards released by ISO will have this high-level structure\n* Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each organization's particular needs\n* A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy\n* Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management system a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement\n* Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organisation can now decide what documented information it needs and what format it should be in\n* Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a common structure and core text<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/august/BSI-obtains-first-global-accreditation-for-the-new-Quality-Management-standard-ISO-90012015-from-ANAB/#.Vem-kxFVhBc|title=BSI obtains first global accreditation from ANAB to certify organizations to the new Quality Management standard ISO 9001:2015|publisher=BSI |accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Inclusion of Knowledge Management principles\n* Quality Manual & Management representative (MR) are no longer mandatory\n\n==Auditing==\n\nTwo types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard: auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a continual process of review and assessment to verify that the system is working as it is supposed to, to find out where it can improve, and to correct or prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors to audit outside their usual management line, so as to bring a degree of independence to their judgements.\n\n==Industry-specific interpretations==\nThe ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to make sense within a particular organization. [[Software development process|Developing software]] is not like making [[cheese]] or offering [[counseling]] services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines, because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of these.  Diverse organizations\u2014police departments (United States), professional [[soccer]] teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)\u2014have successfully implemented ISO 9001:2000 systems.\n\nOver time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardise their interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace.  This is partly to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors are sent to assess them.\n* The '''[[TickIT]]''' guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology industry, especially software development.\n* '''[[AS9000]]''' is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers include [[AlliedSignal]], [[Allison Engine]], [[Boeing]], [[General Electric Aircraft Engines]], [[Lockheed-Martin]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Rockwell-Collins]], [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], and [[Sundstrand Corporation|Sundstrand]]. The current version is '''[[AS9100]]D'''.\n* '''PS 9000''' * '''QS 9000''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] and [[Advanced Product Quality Planning|APQP]]. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.\n* '''[[ISO/TS 16949]]:2009''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements. After the new edition of ISO 9001:2015 the ISO/TS 16949:2009 was also completely revised and reissued by IATF (International Automotive Task Force). IATF 16949:2016 is now a stand-alone standard that doesn't include the ISO 9001:2015 requirements but still refers to them and works as an additional automotive-specific requirement to ISO 9001.\n* '''[[TL 9000]]''' is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, [http://www.questforum.org QuEST Forum]. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements Handbooks are 6.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL 9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer organizations. It is important to note that TL 9000 R6.0 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2015.\n* '''[[ISO 13485]]:2016''' is the medical industry's equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO 13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to medical device manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).\n* '''[[ISO/IEC 90003]]:2014''' provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to computer software.\n* '''[[ISO/TS 29001]]''' is quality management system requirements for the design, development, production, installation, and service of products for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. It is equivalent to API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.\n* '''[[ISO 22000]]''' Food Safety Management Systems.\n*[https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html ISO 17025:2017] is the Quality Management System applicable only to Testing and Calibration Laboratories.\n\n\n==Effectiveness==\n{{Original research|section|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000 commonly centres on the following questions:\n# Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?\n# Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management system?\n# Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?\n\nThe effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of factors, the most significant of which are:\n# Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality. Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire and commitment often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits.\n# How well the ISO system integrates into current business practices.  Many organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard when necessary.\n# How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience.  The broadest definition of quality is \"Whatever the customer perceives good quality to be.\"  This means that a company doesn't necessarily have to make a product that never fails; some customers have a higher tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer service.  An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a continual basis.  This means taking into account all processes that deal with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization). Only then can a company sustain improvements in the customer's experience.\n# How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement.  While ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement.  Many auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language.  Auditors that can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language and terms executive management understands facilitate action on improvement initiatives by the companies they audit.  When management doesn't understand why they were non-compliant and the business implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the reports and focus on what they do understand.\n\n===Advantages===\nProper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage, and avoidance of litigation.<ref name=\"sroufe\">Sroufe, Robert and Sime Curkovic, \"An examination of ISO 9000:2000 and supply chain quality assurance.\" Journal of Operations Management, Volume 26, Issue 4, July 2008, Pages 503-520</ref> The quality principles in ISO 9000:2000 are also sound, according to Wade <ref name=\"wade\"/> and Barnes, who says that \"ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive\".<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base, better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and communication with management.<ref name=\"sroufe\"/> According to ISO<ref>{{cite web|title=Debunking the myths|url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/iso_9001_debunking_the_myths.pdf|website=Iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> the 2015 version of the standard brings the following benefits:\n# By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.\n# Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their organization.\n# By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the organization.\n# Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and efficiency, bringing internal costs down.\n# Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements.\n# Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients require ISO 9001 before doing business.\n\n===Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification===\nA common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later when needed, ISO 9001 certification.<ref name=\"clifford\" /> Dalgleish cites the \"inordinate and often unnecessary paperwork burden\" of ISO, and says that \"quality managers feel that ISO's overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient\".<ref name=\"dalgleish 2003\">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits - ISO 9000: More Hindrance Than Help |work=Quality Magazine |date=5 May 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> The level of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly reduced, going from ISO 9001:2000 to ISO 9001:2008 to ISO 9001:2015.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAccording to Barnes, \"Opponents claim that it is only for documentation.

Additional risks include how much certification will cost, increased bureaucratic processes and risk of poor company image if the certification process fails.<ref name=\"sroufe\"/> According to [[John Seddon]], ISO 9001 promotes specification, [[Control (management)|control]], and procedures rather than [[understanding]] and improvement.<ref name=\"seddon\" /> Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but that promoting it as a standard \"helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, ... [undermining] the need for an organization to set its own quality standards\".<ref name=\"wade\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bin.co.uk/IMS_May_2002.pdf |title=Is ISO 9000 really a standard? |first=Jim |last=Wade |publisher=ISO Management Systems |date=May\u2013June 2002 |access-date=10 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707162351/http://www.bin.co.uk/IMS_May_2002.pdf |archive-date=7 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In short, Wade argues that reliance on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system.\n\nThe standard is seen as especially prone to failure when a company is interested in certification before quality.<ref name=\"seddon\"/> Certifications are in fact often based on customer contractual requirements rather than a desire to actually improve quality.<ref name=\"barnes\"/><ref name=\"henricks\"/> \"If you just want the certificate on the wall, chances are you will create a paper system that doesn't have much to do with the way you actually run your business\", said ISO's Roger Frost.<ref name=\"henricks\">{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2001/december/46342.html |title=ISO a GO-Go |first=Mark |last=Henricks |work=Entrepreneur Magazine |date=December 2001}}</ref> Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as the problem area, and according to Barnes, \"has become a vehicle to increase consulting services\".<ref name=\"barnes\"/>\n\nDalgleish argues that while \"quality has a positive effect on return on investment, market share, sales growth, better sales margins and competitive advantage,\" \"taking a quality approach is unrelated to ISO 9000 registration.\"<ref name=\"dalgleish 2005\">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits: ISO 9001 Proves Ineffective |work=Quality Magazine |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref> In fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without certification, simply for the quality benefits that can be achieved.<ref name=\"isosurvey\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/pdf/survey2005.pdf |title=The ISO Survey \u2013 2005 |version=Abridged version |publisher=ISO |year=2005}}</ref>\n\nAbrahamson argues that fashionable management discourse such as [[Quality Circles]] tends to follow a [[Enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]] in the form of a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]], possibly indicating a [[management fad]].<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=258636 |pages=254\u2013285 |last1=Abrahamson |first1=E. |title=Management Fashion |volume=21 |issue=1 |journal=The Academy of Management Review |year=1996 |doi=10.5465/amr.1996.9602161572}}</ref>\n\nPickrell argues{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} that ISO systems merely gauge whether the processes are being followed. It does not gauge how good the processes are or whether the correct parameters are being measured and controlled to ensure quality. Furthermore, when unique technical solutions are involved in the creation of a new part, ISO does not validate the robustness of the technical solution\u2014a key part of advanced quality planning. It is not unheard of for an ISO-certified plant to display poor quality performance due to poor process selection and/or poor technical solutions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conformity assessment]]\u2014Containing [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published standards\n* [[ISO 10006]]\u2014Quality management\u2014Guidelines to quality management in projects\n* [[ISO 13485]]\u2014Medical devices\u2014Quality management systems\u2014Requirements for regulatory purposes\n* [[ISO 14001]]\u2014Environmental management standards\n* [[ISO 19011]]\u2014Guidelines for quality management systems auditing and environmental management systems auditing\n* [[ISO/TS 16949]]\u2014Quality management system requirements for automotive-related products suppliers\n* [[ISO/IEC 27001]]\u2014Information security management\n* [[ISO 39001]]\u2014Road traffic safety management\n* [[ISO 50001]]\u2014Energy Audit\n* [[AS 9100]]\u2014aerospace industry implementation of ISO 9000/1\n* [[List of ISO standards]]\n* [[ISO/TC 176]]\n* [[Quality management]]\n* [[Quality management system]]\n* [[Test management]]\n* [[Verification and Validation]]\n* [[International Organization for Standardization]]\n* [[Annex SL]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bamford, Robert; Deibler, William (2003).

The film tells of a man who was abused as a child and, as a result, has no interest in having children of his own. When Adrian reveals to her husband that she is pregnant, her husband pressures her to have an abortion. Adrian rebuffs her husband's orders and he neglects her. The [[showrunner]] and Adrian's boss for the soap opera she writes and produces becomes romantically involved with her, eventually marrying her and helping Adrian raise her baby. John Ritter stars as the television producer, Polly Draper as Adrian, and Kevin Kilner portrays Adrian's husband.        \n\nAccording to Hal Erickson, of ''[[AllMovie|Rovi]]'', \"the film was heavily criticized by time of its release, often called a 'yuppie love story.' \"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135384/Danielle-Steel-s-Heartbeat-/overview?scp=2&sq=heartbeat&st=Search Review Summary] The New York Times</ref> It also received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costuming for a Mini Series or a Special.<ref name=emmyaward>{{citenews|url=http://www.emmys.com/content/danielle-steels-heartbeat|title=Danielle Steel's Heartbeat|work=Academy Of Television Arts & Sciences|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nBill Grant is a successful [[television producer]] working on the [[soap opera]] ''A Life Worth Living''. He is a recently divorced man who does not see his sons very often. Unbeknownst to him, he constantly crosses paths with Adrian Towers, a career woman working as a writer for the news. She is married to Steven, a man who had an abusive childhood and therefore has no desire of having children. When she announces that she is pregnant, he forces her to have an [[abortion]]. She reluctantly agrees with him, but is unable to go forward with the termination. When Steven finds out, he leaves her, and threatens to file for divorce if she decides to keep the baby.\n\nAdrian has trouble accepting that Steven leaves her and refuses to talk about it to anyone. She soon becomes acquainted with Bill. Although she likes him a lot, she is still very upset over the divorce, which will be finalized only two weeks before she goes into delivery. She accompanies Bill on a camping trip with his two sons and soon notices how much she likes kids. Although she fails to tell him about her pregnancy, they get to know each other even more.

The film tells of a man who was abused as a child and, as a result, has no interest in having children of his own. When Adrian reveals to her husband that she is pregnant, her husband pressures her to have an abortion. Adrian rebuffs her husband's orders and he neglects her. The [[showrunner]] and Adrian's boss for the soap opera she writes and produces becomes romantically involved with her, eventually marrying her and helping Adrian raise her baby. John Ritter stars as the television producer, Polly Draper as Adrian, and Kevin Kilner portrays Adrian's husband.        \n\nAccording to Hal Erickson, of ''[[AllMovie|Rovi]]'', \"the film was heavily criticized by time of its release, often called a 'yuppie love story.' \"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135384/Danielle-Steel-s-Heartbeat-/overview?scp=2&sq=heartbeat&st=Search Review Summary] The New York Times</ref> It also received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costuming for a Mini Series or a Special.<ref name=emmyaward>{{citenews|url=http://www.emmys.com/content/danielle-steels-heartbeat|title=Danielle Steel's Heartbeat|work=Academy Of Television Arts & Sciences|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nBill Grant is a successful [[television producer]] working on the [[soap opera]] ''A Life Worth Living''. He is a recently divorced man who does not see his sons very often. Unbeknownst to him, he constantly crosses paths with Adrian Towers, a career woman working as a writer for the news. She is married to Steven, a man who had an abusive childhood and therefore has no desire of having children. When she announces that she is pregnant, he forces her to have an [[abortion]]. She reluctantly agrees with him, but is unable to go forward with the termination. When Steven finds out, he leaves her, and threatens to file for divorce if she decides to keep the baby.\n\nAdrian has trouble accepting that Steven leaves her and refuses to talk about it to anyone. She soon becomes acquainted with Bill. Although she likes him a lot, she is still very upset over the divorce, which will be finalized only two weeks before she goes into delivery. She accompanies Bill on a camping trip with his two sons and soon notices how much she likes kids. Although she fails to tell him about her pregnancy, they get to know each other even more. He tells her that he once was afraid to become a father, but that it changed when he first held his sons. After admitting to her that he probably never could marry again, he tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming it is too soon for her.\n\nThe next morning, Tommy, one of Bill's sons, is almost hit by a car.

Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on'' (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), pp. 168-9.</ref> A decade earlier, [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] fused gospel and blues, inventing rock \u2018n roll electric guitar by developing sophisticated phrasing and licks that served as the basis for the iconic rock guitar style of the 1950s and beyond.\n\nArtists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bill Haley and His Comets]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Little Richard]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Big Joe Turner]], and [[Gene Vincent]] released the initial rhythm and blues-influenced early rock and roll hits.  Rock and roll forerunners in the popular music field included [[Johnnie Ray]], [[The Crew-Cuts]], [[The Fontane Sisters]], and [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]].  The Rock and Roll Era is generally dated from the March 25, 1955 premiere of the [[motion picture]], \"[[The Blackboard Jungle]]\". This film\u2019s use of [[Bill Haley and His Comets]]' \"[[(We\u2019re Gonna) Rock Around the Clock]]\" during the opening credits caused a national sensation when teenagers started dancing in the aisles.\n\n[[Pat Boone]] became one of the most successful artists of the 50s with his heavily Pop-influenced \"[[cover version|covers]]\" of R&B hits like \"[[Two Hearts, Two Kisses (Make One Love)]]\", \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\", and \"[[At My Front Door|At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)]]\". Boone got his fame by covering black R&B hits, his cover versions of the original artists outsold the originals. Boone removed the raw feel of the original versions and replaced it with his own voice making it safer and appropriate for mainstream pop radio stations at the time. Boone later found success by ballads and less by R&B covers because R&B covers were declining due to the fact that most people at the time were preferring the originals. Boone's traditional pop approach to rock and roll, coupled with his All-American, clean-cut image helped bring the new sound to a much wider audience.\n\n[[Elvis Presley]], who began his career in the mid-1950s, was the most successful artist of the popular sound of [[rock and roll]] with a series of network television appearances, motion pictures, and chart-topping records. Elvis also brought rock and roll widely into the mainstream of popular culture. Elvis popularized the four-man group and also brought the guitar to become the lead instrument in rock music. Presley popularized [[rockabilly]], a genre that combined [[country music|country]] with [[rhythm and blues]] which some claimed it was a new sound. Some claimed that Presley invented the genre by combining [[country music|country]] with [[rhythm and blues]]. Elvis became the biggest pop craze since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial during that period. Presley's massive success brought rock and roll widely into the mainstream and made it easier for African-American musicians to achieve mainstream success on the pop charts. Boone and Presley's styles/images represented opposite ends of the burgeoning musical form, Boone was known as being safe while Presley was known as being dangerous, which competed with one another throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\n[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument to [[Buddy Holly]], [[Richie Valens]], and [[J.P. Richardson]] (\u201c[[The Big Bopper]]\u201d).]]\nIn 1957, a popular [[television]] show featuring rock and roll performers, [[American Bandstand]], went national. Hosted by [[Dick Clark]], the program helped to popularize the more clean-cut, All-American brand of rock and roll. By the end of the decade, teen idols like [[Bobby Darin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Neil Sedaka]], [[Bobby Rydell]], [[Connie Francis]], and [[Fabian Forte]] were topping the charts. Some commentators have perceived this as the decline of rock and roll; citing the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] in a [[The Day the Music Died|tragic plane crash in 1959]] and the [[Elvis Presley#Military service and mother's death (1958\u201360)|departure of Elvis for the army]] as causes.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, R&B-influenced acts like [[The Crows]], [[The Penguins]], [[The El Dorados]] and [[The Turbans]] all scored major hits, and groups like [[The Platters]], with songs including \"[[The Great Pretender]]\" (1955), and [[The Coasters]] with humorous songs like \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop>V.

Its popularity would spawn the parody \"[[Who Put the Bomp (song)|Who Put the Bomp]]\".\n\n[[Novelty songs]], long a music industry staple, continued their popularity in the Rock and Roll medium with hits such as \"[[Beep Beep (song)|Beep Beep]]\".\n\n===Classic pop===\n[[File:Frankie Laine Patti Page 1950s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frankie Laine]] (at piano) and [[Patti Page]], circa 1950.]]\n[[Popular music]] dominated the charts for the first half of the decade. Vocal-driven classic pop replaced [[big band]]/[[Swing music|swing]] at the end of [[World War II]], although it often used orchestras to back the vocalists. 1940s style [[Crooners]] vied with a new generation of big voiced singers, many drawing on [[Italy|Italian]] [[Canto Bella]] traditions. [[Mitch Miller]], A&R man at the era's most successful label, [[Columbia Records]], set the tone for the development of popular music well into the middle of the decade.<ref name=pc1>{{Gilliland |show=1 |title=Play A Simple Melody: American pop music in the early fifties |ref=harv}} Show 1.</ref> Miller integrated [[Country music|country]], [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[folk music]] into the musical mainstream, by having many of his label's biggest artists record them in a style that corresponded to Pop traditions. Miller often employed novel and ear-catching arrangements featuring classical instruments (whooping [[french horns]], [[harpsichord]]), or sound effects (whip cracks).  He approached each record as a miniature story, often \"casting\" the vocalist according to type.  \n\n<blockquote>(Mitch) Miller and the producers who followed his model were creating a new sort of pop record. Instead of capturing the sound of live groups, they were making three-minute musicals, matching singers to songs in the same way that movie producers matched stars to film roles. As Miller told \"Time\" magazine in 1951, \"Every singer has certain sounds he makes better than others. Frankie Laine is sweat and hard words\u2014he's a guy beating the pillow, a purveyor of basic emotions. Guy Mitchell is better with happy-go-lucky songs; he's a virile young singer, gives people a vicarious lift. Rosemary Clooney is a barrelhouse dame, a hillbilly at heart.\" It was a way of thinking perfectly suited to the new market in which vocalists were creating unique identities and hit songs were performed as television skits.<ref>''How The Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll'', Elijah Wald, Oxford University Press, 2009, p162.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhereas big band/swing music placed the primary emphasis on the orchestration, post-war/early 1950s era Pop focused on the song\u2019s story and/or the emotion being expressed.  By the early 1950s, emotional delivery had reached its apex in the miniature psycho-drama songs of writer-singer [[Johnnie Ray]]. Known as \"The Cry Guy\" and \"The Prince of Wails\", Ray's on-stage emotion wrought \"breakdowns\" provided a release for the pent-up angst of his predominantly teenage fans.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 2}} As Ray described it, \"I make them feel, I exhaust them, I destroy them.\"<ref>''Cry: The Johnnie Ray Story'', Jonny Whiteside, Barricade Books, October 1994.</ref> It was during this period that the fan hysteria, which began with [[Frank Sinatra]] during the [[Second World War]], really began to take hold.\n\nAlthough often ignored by musical historians, Pop music played a significant role in the development of rock 'n' roll as well:\n\n<blockquote>[Mitch] Miller also conceived of the idea of the pop record \"sound\" per se: not so much an arrangement or a tune, but an aural texture (usually replete with extramusical gimmicks) that could be created in the studio and then replicated in live performance, instead of the other way around. Miller was hardly a rock 'n' roller, yet without these ideas there could never have been rock 'n' roll. \"[[Mule Train]]\", Miller's first major hit (for [[Frankie Laine]]) and the foundation of his career, set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rock.  The similarities between it and, say, \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" need hardly be outlined here.<ref>''Sinatra: The Song Is You'', Will Friedwald, Da Capo Press, 1997, p. 174.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Paul Anka Gr\u00f6na Lund 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Anka]] 1959]]\n\n[[Patti Page]] kicked things off with what would become the decade's biggest hit, \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\". Her other hits from this period included: \"[[Mister and Mississippi]]\", \"[[Mockin' Bird Hill]]\", \"[[Detour (song)|Detour]]\", \"[[(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window]]\", and \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\". [[Frankie Laine]]'s 1949 hits, \"[[That Lucky Old Sun]] (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day)\" and \"[[Mule Train]]\", were still riding high on the charts when the decade began. He continued to score with such hits as: \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\", \"[[Cry of the Wild Goose]]\", \"[[Jezebel (Frankie Laine song)|Jezebel]]\", \"[[Rose, Rose, I Love You]]\", \"[[Jealousy (Jalousie)]]\", \"[[High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me)]]\", \"[[I Believe (1953 song)|I Believe]]\", \"[[Granada (song)|Granada]]\", \"[[Moonlight Gambler]]\", and \"[[Rawhide (song)|Rawhide]]\". [[Johnnie Ray]] had a long run of hits in the early half of the decade, often backed by [[The Four Lads]], including: \"[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]\", \"[[The Little White Cloud That Cried]]\", \"[[Walkin' My Baby Back Home (Johnie Ray song)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]\", \"[[Please, Mr. Sun]]\", and \"[[Just Walkin' in the Rain]]\". The Four Lads racked up some hits on their own with \"[[Who Needs You]]\", \"[[No, Not Much]]\", \"[[Standing on the Corner (show tune)|Standin' on the Corner]]\", and \"[[Moments to Remember]]\". [[Nat \"King\" Cole]] dominated the charts throughout the decade with such timeless classics as \"[[Unforgettable (Nat King Cole song)|Unforgettable]]\", \"[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\", \"[[Too Young (1951 song)|Too Young]]\", \"[[Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup]]\", \"[[Pretend (song)|Pretend]]\", \"[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]\", and \"[[A Blossom Fell]]\".

Crooners such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the first half of the decade, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed by the decade's end.<ref>R.

Long regarded the master of these themes was [[Hank Williams]], whose critically acclaimed songwriting resulted in a string of legendary hits and songs, such as \"[[Cold, Cold Heart]]\", \"[[Your Cheating Heart]]\", \"Why Don't You Love Me\" and many more titles. Williams also lived hard, and on January 1, 1953, died. His legacy, however, would live on in country music for decades to come, and be vastly influential to new stars including a young [[Saratoga, Texas]] native named [[George Jones]].\n\nJones, just 23 when he had his first national hit -- \"[[Why Baby Why]]\" -- would go on to become one of country music's most iconic figures for the next 55-plus years. Although some of his early songs included [[rockabilly]] (usually recorded under the pseudonym Thumper Jones), he stayed true to the honky-tonk style for most of his career. In addition to \"Why Baby Why,\" his biggest 1950s hits included \"What Am I Worth\", \"[[Treasure of Love]]\", \"Just One More\" and his first No. 1 hit, \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\", and by the end of the 1990s, that number would increase to more than 100 hit songs.\n\nBesides Williams and Jones, the most popular honky tonk-styled singers included [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] and [[Webb Pierce]].\n\nIn 1955, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' nearly began a nearly six-year run on ABC-TV, the first national TV show to feature country's biggest stars.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the [[Nashville sound]] became country music's response to continued encroachment of genre by rock artists. This new style emphasized string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocals in the vein of mainstream popular music, but utilizing production styles and themes seen in country music. Artists like [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Jim Reeves]], both whom had been well established earlier in the decade, were early pioneers in this style, which went on to see its greatest success in the 1960s. One of the first major Nashville Sound hits was \"[[Oh, Lonesome Me]]\" by [[Don Gibson]]. Also popular was the \"saga song\", often a song with a historical background or having themes of violence, adultery and so forth. Songs by artists such as [[Johnny Horton]] (\"[[The Battle of New Orleans]]\" and \"When It's Springtime in Alaska\"), [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] (\"[[Waterloo (Stonewall Jackson song)|Waterloo]]\"), [[Marty Robbins]] (\"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\") and Lefty Frizzell (\"[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]]\") dominated the charts starting in 1959 and continuing into the early 1960s.\n\n[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo 2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Johnny Cash]] became one of the most popular country music artists during the 1950s.]]\n\nThe late 1950s saw the emergence of the [[Lubbock sound]], but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional country music artists such as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Johnny Horton]] began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.\n\nRockabilly emerged in the early 1950s as a fusion of [[rock and roll]] and [[country music]]. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s. The music was propelled by catchy beats, an [[electric guitar]] and an acoustic [[bass guitar|bass]] which was played using the [[slap-back]] technique. Rockabilly is generally considered to have begun in the early 1950s, when musicians like [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] began mixing [[jump blues]] and electric country. In 1954, however, [[Elvis Presley]] truly began the popularization of the genre with a series of recordings for [[Sun Records]]. \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1955, Bill Haley) was the breakthrough success for the style, and it launched the careers of several rockabilly entertainers.\n\nDuring this period Elvis Presley converted over to country music. He played a huge role in the music industry during this time. The number two, three and four songs on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' charts for that year were [[Elvis Presley]], \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]];\" [[Johnny Cash]], \"[[I Walk the Line]];\" and [[Carl Perkins]], \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1956] ''Billboard.com''</ref> Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 \"Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger\" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley \"Don't/I Beg Of You\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1958] ''Billboard.com''</ref> Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying \"The coloured folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.\"<ref name=\"Workin 1999. page 135\">Workin' Man Blues - Country Music in California.

The significant change of the mid-1950s was the impact of American [[rock and roll]], which provided a new model for performance and recording, based on a youth market. Initially this was dominated by American acts, or re-creations of American forms of music, but soon distinctly European Bands and individual artists began in early attempts to produce local [[Rock and roll]] music.\n\n== Latin America ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Andy_Russell_and_Carmen_Miranda_in_\"Copacabana,\"_1947.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]]]]\n*[[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]] in 1954, relocated to Mexico where he became a star of radio, television, motion pictures, records and nightclubs.\n* In 1958 the American musician [[Ritchie Valens]]'s \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\" popularized [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish language rock music]] throughout [[Latin America]].\n* In 1958 [[Danny Flores|Daniel Flores]], who some call the \"godfather of Latin Rock\", performed his hit song \"[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]\".\n* Argentinian band [[Los Cinco Latinos]] released their first album ''Maravilloso Maravilloso'', which was met with success in Latin America and the United States.<ref>[http://estelaraval.homestead.com/ P\u00e1gina oficial de Estela Raval y los Cinco Latinos]</ref>\n\nHispanics, young and old, could find comfort in the popular rhythmic sounds of Latin music that reminded them of home; [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]] and [[Salsa music|salsa]].

Rock and roll forerunners in the popular music field included [[Johnnie Ray]], [[The Crew-Cuts]], [[The Fontane Sisters]], and [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]].  The Rock and Roll Era is generally dated from the March 25, 1955 premiere of the [[motion picture]], \"[[The Blackboard Jungle]]\". This film\u2019s use of [[Bill Haley and His Comets]]' \"[[(We\u2019re Gonna) Rock Around the Clock]]\" during the opening credits caused a national sensation when teenagers started dancing in the aisles.\n\n[[Pat Boone]] became one of the most successful artists of the 50s with his heavily Pop-influenced \"[[cover version|covers]]\" of R&B hits like \"[[Two Hearts, Two Kisses (Make One Love)]]\", \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\", and \"[[At My Front Door|At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)]]\". Boone got his fame by covering black R&B hits, his cover versions of the original artists outsold the originals. Boone removed the raw feel of the original versions and replaced it with his own voice making it safer and appropriate for mainstream pop radio stations at the time. Boone later found success by ballads and less by R&B covers because R&B covers were declining due to the fact that most people at the time were preferring the originals. Boone's traditional pop approach to rock and roll, coupled with his All-American, clean-cut image helped bring the new sound to a much wider audience.\n\n[[Elvis Presley]], who began his career in the mid-1950s, was the most successful artist of the popular sound of [[rock and roll]] with a series of network television appearances, motion pictures, and chart-topping records. Elvis also brought rock and roll widely into the mainstream of popular culture. Elvis popularized the four-man group and also brought the guitar to become the lead instrument in rock music. Presley popularized [[rockabilly]], a genre that combined [[country music|country]] with [[rhythm and blues]] which some claimed it was a new sound. Some claimed that Presley invented the genre by combining [[country music|country]] with [[rhythm and blues]]. Elvis became the biggest pop craze since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial during that period. Presley's massive success brought rock and roll widely into the mainstream and made it easier for African-American musicians to achieve mainstream success on the pop charts. Boone and Presley's styles/images represented opposite ends of the burgeoning musical form, Boone was known as being safe while Presley was known as being dangerous, which competed with one another throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\n[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Monument to [[Buddy Holly]], [[Richie Valens]], and [[J.P. Richardson]] (\u201c[[The Big Bopper]]\u201d).]]\nIn 1957, a popular [[television]] show featuring rock and roll performers, [[American Bandstand]], went national. Hosted by [[Dick Clark]], the program helped to popularize the more clean-cut, All-American brand of rock and roll. By the end of the decade, teen idols like [[Bobby Darin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Neil Sedaka]], [[Bobby Rydell]], [[Connie Francis]], and [[Fabian Forte]] were topping the charts. Some commentators have perceived this as the decline of rock and roll; citing the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] in a [[The Day the Music Died|tragic plane crash in 1959]] and the [[Elvis Presley#Military service and mother's death (1958\u201360)|departure of Elvis for the army]] as causes.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, R&B-influenced acts like [[The Crows]], [[The Penguins]], [[The El Dorados]] and [[The Turbans]] all scored major hits, and groups like [[The Platters]], with songs including \"[[The Great Pretender]]\" (1955), and [[The Coasters]] with humorous songs like \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop>V.

Its popularity would spawn the parody \"[[Who Put the Bomp (song)|Who Put the Bomp]]\".\n\n[[Novelty songs]], long a music industry staple, continued their popularity in the Rock and Roll medium with hits such as \"[[Beep Beep (song)|Beep Beep]]\".\n\n===Classic pop===\n[[Popular music]] dominated the charts for the first half of the decade. Vocal-driven classic pop replaced [[big band]]/[[Swing music|swing]] at the end of [[World War II]], although it often used orchestras to back the vocalists. 1940s style [[Crooners]] vied with a new generation of big voiced singers, many drawing on [[Italy|Italian]] [[Canto Bella]] traditions. [[Mitch Miller]], A&R man at the era's most successful label, [[Columbia Records]], set the tone for the development of popular music well into the middle of the decade.<ref name=pc1>{{Gilliland |show=1 |title=Play A Simple Melody: American pop music in the early fifties |ref=harv}} Show 1.</ref> Miller integrated [[Country music|country]], [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[folk music]] into the musical mainstream, by having many of his label's biggest artists record them in a style that corresponded to Pop traditions. Miller often employed novel and ear-catching arrangements featuring classical instruments (whooping [[french horns]], [[harpsichord]]), or sound effects (whip cracks).  He approached each record as a miniature story, often \"casting\" the vocalist according to type.  \n\n<blockquote>(Mitch) Miller and the producers who followed his model were creating a new sort of pop record. Instead of capturing the sound of live groups, they were making three-minute musicals, matching singers to songs in the same way that movie producers matched stars to film roles. As Miller told \"Time\" magazine in 1951, \"Every singer has certain sounds he makes better than others. Frankie Laine is sweat and hard words\u2014he's a guy beating the pillow, a purveyor of basic emotions. Guy Mitchell is better with happy-go-lucky songs; he's a virile young singer, gives people a vicarious lift. Rosemary Clooney is a barrelhouse dame, a hillbilly at heart.\" It was a way of thinking perfectly suited to the new market in which vocalists were creating unique identities and hit songs were performed as television skits.<ref>''How The Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll'', Elijah Wald, Oxford University Press, 2009, p162.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhereas big band/swing music placed the primary emphasis on the orchestration, post-war/early 1950s era Pop focused on the song\u2019s story and/or the emotion being expressed.  By the early 1950s, emotional delivery had reached its apex in the miniature psycho-drama songs of writer-singer [[Johnnie Ray]]. Known as \"The Cry Guy\" and \"The Prince of Wails\", Ray's on-stage emotion wrought \"breakdowns\" provided a release for the pent-up angst of his predominantly teenage fans.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 2}} As Ray described it, \"I make them feel, I exhaust them, I destroy them.\"<ref>''Cry: The Johnnie Ray Story'', Jonny Whiteside, Barricade Books, October 1994.</ref> It was during this period that the fan hysteria, which began with [[Frank Sinatra]] during the [[Second World War]], really began to take hold.\n\nAlthough often ignored by musical historians, Pop music played a significant role in the development of rock 'n' roll as well:\n\n<blockquote>[Mitch] Miller also conceived of the idea of the pop record \"sound\" per se: not so much an arrangement or a tune, but an aural texture (usually replete with extramusical gimmicks) that could be created in the studio and then replicated in live performance, instead of the other way around. Miller was hardly a rock 'n' roller, yet without these ideas there could never have been rock 'n' roll. \"[[Mule Train]]\", Miller's first major hit (for [[Frankie Laine]]) and the foundation of his career, set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rock.  The similarities between it and, say, \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" need hardly be outlined here.<ref>''Sinatra: The Song Is You'', Will Friedwald, Da Capo Press, 1997, p. 174.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Frankie Laine Patti Page 1950s.jpg|thumb|Frankie Laine (at piano) and Patti Page, circa 1950.]]\n\n[[Patti Page]] kicked things off with what would become the decade's biggest hit, \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\". Her other hits from this period included: \"[[Mister and Mississippi]]\", \"[[Mockin' Bird Hill]]\", \"[[Detour (song)|Detour]]\", \"[[(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window]]\", and \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\". [[Frankie Laine]]'s 1949 hits, \"[[That Lucky Old Sun]] (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day)\" and \"[[Mule Train]]\", were still riding high on the charts when the decade began.

Crooners such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the first half of the decade, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed by the decade's end.<ref>R.

However, it wasn't until he prepared a demo in 1954, that caught the attention of [[Specialty Records]], that the world would start to hear his new, uptempo, funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock and roll. A rapid succession of rhythm-and-blues hits followed, beginning with \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" and \"[[Long Tall Sally]]\",{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 6}} which would influence performers such as [[James Brown]],<ref name=\"white\">White, Charles (2003).

The label was a major factor in the creation of the [[Southern soul]] and [[Memphis soul]] styles.\n\nIn 1959, two black-owned record labels, one of which would become hugely successful, made their debut: [[Sam Cooke]]'s Sar, and [[Berry Gordy]]'s [[Motown Records]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Palmer (author/producer)|title=Rock & Roll: An Unruly History|date=19 September 1995|publisher=Harmony|isbn=978-0-517-70050-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/rockrollunrulyh00palm/page/82 82]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rockrollunrulyh00palm/page/82}}</ref>{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 25}}\n\n===Blues===\n[[File:Ray Charles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ray Charles]]\n[[Blues]] had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music in the 1950s with the enthusiastic playing styles of popular musicians like [[Bo Diddley]]<ref name=\"Herzhaft, pg. 53\">Herzhaft, pg. 53</ref> and [[Chuck Berry]],<ref>Herzhaft, pg. 11</ref> departed from the melancholy aspects of blues and influenced [[Rock and roll]] music.\n\n[[Ray Charles]] and [[Fats Domino]] help bring [[blues]] into the popular music scene.

Long regarded the master of these themes was [[Hank Williams]], whose critically acclaimed songwriting resulted in a string of legendary hits and songs, such as \"[[Cold, Cold Heart]]\", \"[[Your Cheating Heart]]\", \"Why Don't You Love Me\" and many more titles. Williams also lived hard, and on January 1, 1953, died. His legacy, however, would live on in country music for decades to come, and be vastly influential to new stars including a young [[Saratoga, Texas]] native named [[George Jones]].\n\nJones, just 23 when he had his first national hit -- \"[[Why Baby Why]]\" -- would go on to become one of country music's most iconic figures for the next 55-plus years. Although some of his early songs included [[rockabilly]] (usually recorded under the pseudonym Thumper Jones), he stayed true to the honky-tonk style for most of his career. In addition to \"Why Baby Why,\" his biggest 1950s hits included \"What Am I Worth\", \"[[Treasure of Love]]\", \"Just One More\" and his first No. 1 hit, \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\", and by the end of the 1990s, that number would increase to more than 100 hit songs.\n\nBesides Williams and Jones, the most popular honky tonk-styled singers included [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] and [[Webb Pierce]].\n\nIn 1955, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' nearly began a nearly six-year run on ABC-TV, the first national TV show to feature country's biggest stars.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the [[Nashville sound]] became country music's response to continued encroachment of genre by rock artists. This new style emphasized string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocals in the vein of mainstream popular music, but utilizing production styles and themes seen in country music. Artists like [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Jim Reeves]], both whom had been well established earlier in the decade, were early pioneers in this style, which went on to see its greatest success in the 1960s. One of the first major Nashville Sound hits was \"[[Oh, Lonesome Me]]\" by [[Don Gibson]]. Also popular was the \"saga song\", often a song with a historical background or having themes of violence, adultery and so forth. Songs by artists such as [[Johnny Horton]] (\"[[The Battle of New Orleans]]\" and \"When It's Springtime in Alaska\"), [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] (\"[[Waterloo (Stonewall Jackson song)|Waterloo]]\"), [[Marty Robbins]] (\"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\") and Lefty Frizzell (\"[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]]\") dominated the charts starting in 1959 and continuing into the early 1960s.\n\n[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo 2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Johnny Cash]] became one of the most popular country music artists during the 1950s.]]\n\nThe late 1950s saw the emergence of the [[Lubbock sound]], but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional country music artists such as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Johnny Horton]] began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.\n\nRockabilly emerged in the early 1950s as a fusion of [[rock and roll]] and [[country music]]. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s. The music was propelled by catchy beats, an [[electric guitar]] and an acoustic [[bass guitar|bass]] which was played using the [[slap-back]] technique. Rockabilly is generally considered to have begun in the early 1950s, when musicians like [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] began mixing [[jump blues]] and electric country. In 1954, however, [[Elvis Presley]] truly began the popularization of the genre with a series of recordings for [[Sun Records]]. \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1955, Bill Haley) was the breakthrough success for the style, and it launched the careers of several rockabilly entertainers.\n\nDuring this period Elvis Presley converted over to country music. He played a huge role in the music industry during this time. The number two, three and four songs on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' charts for that year were [[Elvis Presley]], \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]];\" [[Johnny Cash]], \"[[I Walk the Line]];\" and [[Carl Perkins]], \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1956] ''Billboard.com''</ref> Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 \"Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger\" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley \"Don't/I Beg Of You\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1958] ''Billboard.com''</ref> Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying \"The coloured folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.\"<ref name=\"Workin 1999. page 135\">Workin' Man Blues - Country Music in California.

The significant change of the mid-1950s was the impact of American [[rock and roll]], which provided a new model for performance and recording, based on a youth market. Initially this was dominated by American acts, or re-creations of American forms of music, but soon distinctly European Bands and individual artists began in early attempts to produce local [[Rock and roll]] music.\n\n== Latin America ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Andy_Russell_and_Carmen_Miranda_in_\"Copacabana,\"_1947.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]]]]\n*[[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]] in 1954, relocated to Mexico where he became a star of radio, television, motion pictures, records and nightclubs.\n* In 1958 the American musician [[Ritchie Valens]]'s \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\" popularized [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish language rock music]] throughout [[Latin America]].\n* In 1958 [[Danny Flores|Daniel Flores]], who some call the \"godfather of Latin Rock\", performed his hit song \"[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]\".\n* Argentinian band [[Los Cinco Latinos]] released their first album ''Maravilloso Maravilloso'', which was met with success in Latin America and the United States.<ref>[http://estelaraval.homestead.com/ P\u00e1gina oficial de Estela Raval y los Cinco Latinos]</ref>\n\nHispanics, young and old, could find comfort in the popular rhythmic sounds of Latin music that reminded them of home; [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]] and [[Salsa music|salsa]]. [[Tito Puente]], an American born [[Puerto Rican people|Boricua]] (Puerto Rican), revolutionized the Latin music of the time.
