In a 1986 interview for ''[[Newsday]]'', DeFeo claimed his sister Dawn killed their father and then their distraught mother killed all of his siblings before he killed his mother. He stated that he took the blame because he was afraid to say anything negative about his mother to her father, [[Michael Brigante Sr.]], and his father's uncle, out of fear that they would kill him.  His father's uncle was [[Pete DeFeo]], a ''[[caporegime]]'' in the [[Genovese crime family]]. In this interview, DeFeo also asserted he was married at the time of the murders to a woman named Geraldine Gates, with whom he was living in New Jersey, and that his mother phoned to ask him to return to Amityville to break up a fight between Dawn and their father.  Subsequently, he drove to Amityville with Geraldine's brother, Richard Romondoe, who was with him at the time of the murders and could verify his story completely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keeler|first=Bob|title=\"DeFeo's New Story,\" Newsday, March 19, 1986|url=http://amityvilletruth.freeservers.com/newsday.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Ronald DeFeo Jr. filed a 440 motion, a proceeding to have his conviction vacated. In support of his motion, DeFeo asserted that Dawn and an unknown assailant, who fled the house before he could get a good look at him, killed their parents and Dawn subsequently killed their siblings. He said the only person he killed was Dawn and that it was by accident as they struggled over the rifle. Again, he asserted he was married to Geraldine and that her brother was with him at the time of the murders. An affidavit from Richard Romondoe was submitted to the court and it was asserted he could not be located to testify in person. Evidence was submitted to the court by the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office suggesting that Richard Romondoe did not exist and that Geraldine Gates was living in upstate New York married to someone else at the time of the murders.  Geraldine Gates did not testify at this hearing because the authorities had already confronted her about the false claims and in 1992 secured a statement under oath where she admitted Romondoe was fictitious and that she did not actually marry DeFeo until 1989 in anticipation of the filing of the 440 motion.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Night The Defeos Died|last = Osuna|first = Ric|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|year = 2002|isbn = 1401046452|location = |pages = 334\u201335}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}</ref>\n\nJudge Stark denied the motion, writing, \"I find the testimony of the defendant overall to be false and fabricated. His testimony that during the fall of 1974 he was married and lived with his wife and child at Long Branch, New Jersey is incredible and not worthy of belief. He produced no corroborating evidence in this regard... another reason for my disbelief of defendant's testimony is demonstrated by consideration of several portions of the trial testimony... he signed a lengthy written statement describing in detail his activities... in this statement he said that he lived with his family at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville and that he worked for his father... that he usually went to and from work with his father; that he was ill and stayed home from work on November 12, 1974; that he was on probation for having stolen an outboard engine and had an appointment to see his probation officer in Amityville on that very afternoon... defendant's girlfriend, Mindy Weiss, testified that she began dating the defendant in June 1974, and was with him frequently that summer and fall\". Stark further declared, \"Defendant's testimony that he did not shoot and kill the members of his family is likewise incredible and not worthy of belief\".<ref>Stark, Thomas J.S.C: ''People v DeFeo Memorandum Denying Motion To Vacate Conviction'', dated January 6, 1993, p. 3-4</ref>\n\nOn November 30, 2000, Ronald DeFeo met with Ric Osuna, the author of ''The Night the DeFeos Died'', which was published in 2002.  According to Osuna they spoke for about six hours.  However, in a letter to the radio show host Lou Gentile, DeFeo Jr. denied giving Ric Osuna information that could be used in his book, claiming that he immediately left the interview and did not speak to Osuna about anything substantive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amityvillehorrortruth.com/defeo.htm |title=Ronnie DeFeo Jr. |publisher=Amityvillehorrortruth.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701030950/http://www.amityvillehorrortruth.com/defeo.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Osuna, DeFeo Jr. claimed that he had committed the murders with his sister Dawn and two friends, Augie Degenero and Bobby Kelske, \"out of desperation\" because his parents had plotted to kill him. Allegedly, Ronald claimed that, after a furious row with his father, he and his sister planned to kill their parents and that Dawn murdered the children in order to eliminate them as witnesses. He said that he was enraged on discovering his sister's actions, knocked her unconscious on to her bed and shot her in the head. Police found traces of unburned [[gunpowder]] on Dawn's nightgown, which DeFeo proponents allege proves she discharged a firearm.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.castleofspirits.com/amitycultural2.html |title=Amityville - the Cultural Impact of Homicide |publisher=Castleofspirits.com |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205033935/http://www.castleofspirits.com./amitycultural2.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>  However, at trial, the ballistics expert, Alfred Della Penna, testified that unburned gunpowder is discharged through the muzzle of a weapon, indicating that she was in proximity to the muzzle of the weapon when it was discharged and not that she fired the weapon. He reiterated this on an [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] Amityville documentary that is extensively discussed in Will Savive's ''Mentally Ill In Amityville''. Savive had an expert evaluate Della Penna's assessment and the expert confirmed that he was correct. Moreover, the medical examiner found nothing to indicate that Dawn had been in a struggle; the bullet wound was the only fresh mark on her body.\n\n[[Joe Nickell]] notes that given the frequency with which Ronald DeFeo has changed his story over the years, any new claims from him regarding the events that took place on the night of the murders should be approached with caution.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell |first=Joe |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/amityville_the_horror_of_it_all/ |title=Amityville Horror Investigative Files (January 2003) |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |date=January 2003 |accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost of the claims made in Ric Osuna's book are sourced to Ronald DeFeo Jr.'s ex-wife, Geraldine Gates.  While in the 1986 interview with ''Newsday'' she asserted she married DeFeo in 1974, in Osuna's book, she alleges they married in 1970. Their 1993 divorce case says that they met in 1985, married in 1989 and divorced in 1993.<ref>New York Supreme Court ''DeFeo v.

The film, released on December 16, 2011, was written, directed and produced by Ryan Katzenbach and featuring narration by veteran actor [[Ed Asner]], examines all aspects of the Amityville case, with a strong focus on the DeFeo family and the events surrounding their murders.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|The Amityville Horror (franchise)|List of films based on the Amityville haunting}}\n* [[Jay Anson]]'s novel ''[[The Amityville Horror]]'' was published in September 1977. The book is based on the 28-day period during December 1975 and January 1976 when George and Kathy Lutz and their three children lived at 112 Ocean Avenue. The Lutz family left the house, claiming that they had been terrorized by [[paranormal]] phenomena while living there.<ref name=\":0\" /> The book's [[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|1979 film adaptation]] became the highest-grossing independent film of all time and held that record until 1990.

It is set at 112 Ocean Avenue, featuring the fictional Montelli family, who are said to be based on the DeFeo family. The story introduces speculative and controversial themes, including an [[incest]]uous relationship between Sonny Montelli and his teenage sister, based loosely on a rumor of an incestuous relationship between DeFeo and his sister Dawn.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0083550/ |title=Amityville II: The Possession (1982)}}</ref>\n* The film versions of the DeFeo murders contain several inaccuracies. The 2005 remake of ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' contains a fictional child character called Jodie DeFeo. The claim that DeFeo was influenced to commit the murders by spirits from a [[Lenape]] burial ground on the site of 112 Ocean Avenue has been rejected by local historians and [[Lenape|Native American]] leaders, who argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the burial ground ever existed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amityvillemurders.com/facts.html |title=The Amityville Murders |publisher=Amityvillemurders.com |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707134040/http://www.amityvillemurders.com/facts.html |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Law|New York (state)}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150510092918/http://www.amityvillefiles.com/murders.htm The Amityville Files- Collection of Amityville materials]\n*[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/amityville/1.html The case at Court TV's Crime Library]\n*[http://truelegends.info/amityville/call.htm Transcript of 911 emergency call to Suffolk County Police reporting the shootings.]\n*[http://murderpedia.org/male.D/d/defeo-ronald.htm Entry at murderpedia.org]\n{{The Amityville Horror}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Defeo, Ronald Jr.}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1974 mass shootings in the United States]]\n[[Category:20th-century American criminals]]\n[[Category:American mass murderers]]\n[[Category:American murderers of children]]\n[[Category:American people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Familicides]]\n[[Category:Parricides]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1974]]\n[[Category:Murder in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in the United States]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by New York (state)]]\n[[Category:People from Amityville, New York]]\n[[Category:People from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:People from Long Island]]\n[[Category:People with antisocial personality disorder]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Crimes in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:The Amityville Horror]]\n[[Category:Mass shootings in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Short description|American mass murderer}}\n{{Infobox murderer\n| name        = Ronald DeFeo Jr.\n| image       = ronald defeo.jpg\n| caption     = DeFeo's [[mug shot]], November 14, 1974\n| birth_name  = Ronald Joseph DeFeo Jr.\n| birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|1951|9|26}}\n| birth_place = [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]\n| death_date  = \n| death_place = \n| other_names = Butch\n| conviction  = 6 counts of [[second-degree murder]]\n| penalty     = 6 concurrent sentences of 25 years to [[life imprisonment|life]]\n| date        = November 13, 1974\n| targets     = His family\n| fatalities  = 6\n| weapons     = [[Marlin Model 336|.35 Marlin rifle]]\n}}\n\n'''Ronald Joseph 'Butch' DeFeo Jr.''' (born September 26, 1951)<ref>[https://www.google.com/books?id=mUg4AAAAQBAJ&dq=Defeo+Brooklyn+1951+Adelphi&source=gbs_navlinks_s Talking with Serial Killers: The Most Evil People in the World Tell Their Own Stories]'' Google E-books, {{ISBN|1843586177}}</ref> is an American [[mass murderer]] who was tried and convicted for the 1974 killings of his father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters.

Neighbors did not report hearing any gunshots being fired, and those who were awake at the time of the murders simply heard the family's [[sheep dog]], Shaggy, barking.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gupte|first=Pranay|date=November 18, 1974|title=Slain Family Drugged, Police on L:I..Report|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/18/archives/slain-family-drugged-police-on-li-report-motive-still-sought.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[Amityville, New York]]|access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDeFeo had a volatile relationship with his father, but the motive for the killings remains unclear.

In a 1986 interview for ''[[Newsday]]'', DeFeo claimed his sister Dawn killed their father and then their distraught mother killed all of his siblings before he killed his mother. He stated that he took the blame because he was afraid to say anything negative about his mother to her father, [[Michael Brigante Sr.]], and his father's uncle, out of fear that they would kill him.  His father's uncle was [[Pete DeFeo]], a ''[[caporegime]]'' in the [[Genovese crime family]]. In this interview, DeFeo also asserted he was married at the time of the murders to a woman named Geraldine Gates, with whom he was living in New Jersey, and that his mother phoned to ask him to return to Amityville to break up a fight between Dawn and their father.  Subsequently, he drove to Amityville with Geraldine's brother, Richard Romondoe, who was with him at the time of the murders and could verify his story completely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keeler|first=Bob|title=\"DeFeo's New Story,\" Newsday, March 19, 1986|url=http://amityvilletruth.freeservers.com/newsday.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Ronald DeFeo Jr. filed a 440 motion, a proceeding to have his conviction vacated. In support of his motion, DeFeo asserted that Dawn and an unknown assailant, who fled the house before he could get a good look at him, killed their parents and Dawn subsequently killed their siblings. He said the only person he killed was Dawn and that it was by accident as they struggled over the rifle. Again, he asserted he was married to Geraldine and that her brother was with him at the time of the murders. An affidavit from Richard Romondoe was submitted to the court and it was asserted he could not be located to testify in person. Evidence was submitted to the court by the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office suggesting that Richard Romondoe did not exist and that Geraldine Gates was living in upstate New York married to someone else at the time of the murders.  Geraldine Gates did not testify at this hearing because the authorities had already confronted her about the false claims and in 1992 secured a statement under oath where she admitted Romondoe was fictitious and that she did not actually marry DeFeo until 1989 in anticipation of the filing of the 440 motion.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Night The Defeos Died|last = Osuna|first = Ric|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|year = 2002|isbn = 1401046452|location = |pages = 334\u201335}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}</ref>\n\nJudge Stark denied the motion, writing, \"I find the testimony of the defendant overall to be false and fabricated. His testimony that during the fall of 1974 he was married and lived with his wife and child at Long Branch, New Jersey is incredible and not worthy of belief. He produced no corroborating evidence in this regard... another reason for my disbelief of defendant's testimony is demonstrated by consideration of several portions of the trial testimony... he signed a lengthy written statement describing in detail his activities... in this statement he said that he lived with his family at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville and that he worked for his father... that he usually went to and from work with his father; that he was ill and stayed home from work on November 12, 1974; that he was on probation for having stolen an outboard engine and had an appointment to see his probation officer in Amityville on that very afternoon... defendant's girlfriend, Mindy Weiss, testified that she began dating the defendant in June 1974, and was with him frequently that summer and fall\". Stark further declared, \"Defendant's testimony that he did not shoot and kill the members of his family is likewise incredible and not worthy of belief\".<ref>Stark, Thomas J.S.C: ''People v DeFeo Memorandum Denying Motion To Vacate Conviction'', dated January 6, 1993, p. 3-4</ref>\n\nOn November 30, 2000, Ronald DeFeo met with Ric Osuna, the author of ''The Night the DeFeos Died'', which was published in 2002.  According to Osuna they spoke for about six hours.  However, in a letter to the radio show host Lou Gentile, DeFeo Jr. denied giving Ric Osuna information that could be used in his book, claiming that he immediately left the interview and did not speak to Osuna about anything substantive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amityvillehorrortruth.com/defeo.htm |title=Ronnie DeFeo Jr. |publisher=Amityvillehorrortruth.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701030950/http://www.amityvillehorrortruth.com/defeo.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Osuna, DeFeo Jr. claimed that he had committed the murders with his sister Dawn and two friends, Augie Degenero and Bobby Kelske, \"out of desperation\" because his parents had plotted to kill him. Allegedly, Ronald claimed that, after a furious row with his father, he and his sister planned to kill their parents and that Dawn murdered the children in order to eliminate them as witnesses. He said that he was enraged on discovering his sister's actions, knocked her unconscious on to her bed and shot her in the head. Police found traces of unburned [[gunpowder]] on Dawn's nightgown, which DeFeo proponents allege proves she discharged a firearm.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.castleofspirits.com/amitycultural2.html |title=Amityville - the Cultural Impact of Homicide |publisher=Castleofspirits.com |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205033935/http://www.castleofspirits.com./amitycultural2.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>  However, at trial, the ballistics expert, Alfred Della Penna, testified that unburned gunpowder is discharged through the muzzle of a weapon, indicating that she was in proximity to the muzzle of the weapon when it was discharged and not that she fired the weapon. He reiterated this on an [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] Amityville documentary that is extensively discussed in Will Savive's ''Mentally Ill In Amityville''. Savive had an expert evaluate Della Penna's assessment and the expert confirmed that he was correct. Moreover, the medical examiner found nothing to indicate that Dawn had been in a struggle; the bullet wound was the only fresh mark on her body.\n\n[[Joe Nickell]] notes that given the frequency with which Ronald DeFeo has changed his story over the years, any new claims from him regarding the events that took place on the night of the murders should be approached with caution.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell |first=Joe |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/amityville_the_horror_of_it_all/ |title=Amityville Horror Investigative Files (January 2003) |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |date=January 2003 |accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost of the claims made in Ric Osuna's book are sourced to Ronald DeFeo Jr.'s ex-wife, Geraldine Gates.  While in the 1986 interview with ''Newsday'' she asserted she married DeFeo in 1974, in Osuna's book, she alleges they married in 1970. Their 1993 divorce case says that they met in 1985, married in 1989 and divorced in 1993.<ref>New York Supreme Court ''DeFeo v.

The film, released on December 16, 2011, was written, directed and produced by Ryan Katzenbach and featuring narration by veteran actor [[Ed Asner]], examines all aspects of the Amityville case, with a strong focus on the DeFeo family and the events surrounding their murders.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|The Amityville Horror (franchise)|List of films based on the Amityville haunting}}\n* [[Jay Anson]]'s novel ''[[The Amityville Horror]]'' was published in September 1977. The book is based on the 28-day period during December 1975 and January 1976 when George and Kathy Lutz and their three children lived at 112 Ocean Avenue. The Lutz family left the house, claiming that they had been terrorized by [[paranormal]] phenomena while living there.<ref name=\":0\" /> The book's [[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|1979 film adaptation]] became the highest-grossing independent film of all time and held that record until 1990.

It is set at 112 Ocean Avenue, featuring the fictional Montelli family, who are said to be based on the DeFeo family. The story introduces speculative and controversial themes, including an [[incest]]uous relationship between Sonny Montelli and his teenage sister, based loosely on a rumor of an incestuous relationship between DeFeo and his sister Dawn.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0083550/ |title=Amityville II: The Possession (1982)}}</ref>\n* The film versions of the DeFeo murders contain several inaccuracies. The 2005 remake of ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' contains a fictional child character called Jodie DeFeo. The claim that DeFeo was influenced to commit the murders by spirits from a [[Lenape]] burial ground on the site of 112 Ocean Avenue has been rejected by local historians and [[Lenape|Native American]] leaders, who argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the burial ground ever existed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amityvillemurders.com/facts.html |title=The Amityville Murders |publisher=Amityvillemurders.com |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707134040/http://www.amityvillemurders.com/facts.html |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Law|New York (state)}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150510092918/http://www.amityvillefiles.com/murders.htm The Amityville Files- Collection of Amityville materials]\n*[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/amityville/1.html The case at Court TV's Crime Library]\n*[http://truelegends.info/amityville/call.htm Transcript of 911 emergency call to Suffolk County Police reporting the shootings.]\n*[http://murderpedia.org/male.D/d/defeo-ronald.htm Entry at murderpedia.org]\n{{The Amityville Horror}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Defeo, Ronald Jr.}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1974 mass shootings in the United States]]\n[[Category:20th-century American criminals]]\n[[Category:American mass murderers]]\n[[Category:American murderers of children]]\n[[Category:American people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Familicides]]\n[[Category:Parricides]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1974]]\n[[Category:Murder in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in the United States]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by New York (state)]]\n[[Category:People from Amityville, New York]]\n[[Category:People from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:People from Long Island]]\n[[Category:People with antisocial personality disorder]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Crimes in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:The Amityville Horror]]\n[[Category:Mass shootings in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "98.190.57.245", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Ronald Defao Jr. Didn't Kill Anyone...
