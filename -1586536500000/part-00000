He is sometimes known as the \"father of the [[Texas Panhandle]].\" [[Essayist]] and [[historian]] [[J. Frank Dobie]] said that Goodnight \"approached greatness more nearly than any other [[Cowman (profession)|cowman]] of history.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= From Ranch to Railhead with Charles Goodnight |author= Deborah Hedstrom-Page |year= 2007 |publisher= B&H Publishing Group |isbn= 0-8054-3272-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2IKDvgxIEVsC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=charles+goodnight+%2B+greatness#PPA41,M1 }}</ref> In 1955, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Westerners]] of the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hall of Great Westerners |url=https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/hall-of-great-westerners/ |website=National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum |accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n\nGoodnight was born in [[Macoupin County, Illinois]], northeast of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], the fourth child of Charles Goodnight and the former Charlotte Collier. Goodnight's father's grave is located in a pasture south of [[Bunker Hill, Illinois]].\n\nGoodnight moved to Texas in 1846 with his mother and [[stepfather]], Hiram Daugherty. In 1856, he became a [[cowboy]] and served with the local [[militia]], fighting against [[Comanche]] raiders. A year later, in 1857, Goodnight joined the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. Goodnight is also known for raising and leading a posse against the [[Comanche]] in 1860 that located the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] camp where [[Cynthia Ann Parker]] was living with her husband, [[Peta Nocona]], then guiding Texas Rangers to the camp, leading to Cynthia Ann's recapture.<ref>S.C. Gwynne, Empire of the Summer Moon. New York: Scribner, 2010, pp. 173-175.</ref> He later made a treaty with her son, [[Quanah Parker]]. His father owned a ranch that expanded to 500 acres.\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Most of his time was spent as part of a frontier regiment guarding against raids by Indians.\n\nGoodnight described what it took to become a scout, \"First, he must be born a natural woodsman and have the faculty of never needing a compass except in snow storms or darkness.\"<ref>Goodnight, C., The Making of a Scout, manuscript, [[Panhandle Plains Historical Museum]], Canyon, Texas</ref>\n\n== Cattle ==\n[[Image:Goodnight Trail marker.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The 2,000-mile Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from the [[Texas Panhandle]] and into [[Colorado]] as it headed north into [[Wyoming]].]]\n[[File:Charles Goodnight in Canyon IMG 0074.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Charles Goodnight statue outside of the [[Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum]] at the [[West Texas A&M University]] campus]]\n\nFollowing the war, he became involved in the [[Cowboy|herding]] of feral [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] cattle northward from [[West Texas]] to railroads. This \"making the gather\" was a near-statewide round-up of cattle that had roamed free during the four long years of war. In 1866, [[Oliver Loving]] and he drove their first herd of cattle northward along what would become known as the [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]]. Early in the partnership with Loving, they pastured cattle at such sites as [[Capulin Volcano National Monument|Capulin Mountain]] in northeastern [[New Mexico]]. Goodnight invented the [[chuckwagon]], which was first used on the initial cattle drive. Upon arriving in New Mexico, they formed a partnership with [[New Mexico]] cattleman [[John Chisum]] for future contracts to supply the [[United States Army]] with cattle. After Loving's death, Goodnight and Chisum extended the trail from New Mexico to Colorado, and eventually to [[Wyoming]]. The Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from Belknap, Texas, to Fort Sumner, New Mexico.\n\nGoodnight and Loving were close friends. Goodnight sat by Loving's bed during the two weeks the latter took to die, and reportedly kept a photograph of Loving in his pocket long after his death, and later put a photograph on his desk. As requested by the dying Loving, Goodnight carried the body from New Mexico to [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]] in [[Parker County, Texas|Parker County]] for burial. In [[Larry McMurtry]]'s novel'' [[Lonesome Dove]]'', Gus and Call are schematic representations of Oliver Loving and Charles Goodnight, respectively.\n\nTo take advantage of available grass, timber, water, and game, he founded in 1876 what was to become the first Texas Panhandle ranch, the [[JA Ranch]], in the [[Palo Duro Canyon]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Texas State | first = Historical Commission | title = Charles Goodnight Historical Marker, Armstrong County, Tx | url = http://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=Charles+Goodnight&cnty=armstrong | accessdate = 2008-10-10 }}</ref> of the Texas Panhandle. He partnered with the [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman [[John George Adair]] to create the JA, which stands for \"John Adair\". In 1880, Goodnight was a founder of the Panhandle Stockman's Association. The organization sought to improve cattle-breeding methods and to reduce the threat of [[rustler]]s and [[outlaw]]s. After Adair's death in 1885, Goodnight worked in partnership for a time with Adair's widow [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]].\n\nHe also developed an acquaintanceship with [[W. D. Twichell]], who lived in Amarillo from 1890 to 1918, and surveyed 165 of the 254 Texas counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swco.ttu.edu/abstracts/2614.htm|title=Oral History Collection|publisher=Texas Tech University, Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library|accessdate=May 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725193300/http://swco.ttu.edu/abstracts/2614.htm|archive-date=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter Goodnight had already left the JA, [[Tom Blasingame]] came to the ranch in 1918. Blasingame worked there most of the next 73 years, having, at the time of his death in 1989, become the oldest cowboy in the [[history]] of the [[American West]].\n\n==Bison==\n\nIn addition to raising cattle 1876, the Goodnights preserved a herd of native plains [[American Bison|bison]] that year, which is said to survive to this day in [[Caprock Canyons State Park]]. The herd in Caprock Canyons was actually donated by JA Ranch and no documentation demonstrates that this was the herd preserved by the Goodnights. Bison of this herd were introduced into the [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1902 and into the larger zoos and ranches throughout the nation. He also crossbred the bison with domestic cattle, which he called [[Beefalo|cattalo]]. [[Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones]], a co-founder of [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], [[Kansas]], after meeting with Goodnight in Texas, also bred cattalo, or beefalo, on a ranch near [[Grand Canyon National Park]] in northern [[Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-shgape&month=0008&week=c&msg=4ZaC2nPza053qdx7jtInAg&user=&pw=|title=Buffalo Jones|publisher=h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=September 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306074551/http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-shgape&month=0008&week=c&msg=4ZaC2nPza053qdx7jtInAg&user=&pw=|archive-date=March 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn July 26, 1870, Goodnight married [[Mary Ann (Molly) Goodnight|Mary Ann \"Molly\" Dyer]], a [[teacher]] from Weatherford, west of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. Goodnight developed a practical [[sidesaddle]] for Molly. Though he was not of his wife's denomination, Goodnight donated money to build a [[Methodist]] church in Goodnight. Molly and he also established the Goodnight Academy to offer post[[elementary education]] to hundreds of children of ranchers.\n\nIn his younger years, Goodnight smoked some 50 [[cigar]]s per day, but switched to a [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] in his mature years. He never learned to read or write, but had his wives write letters for him to various individuals, including Quanah Parker. During his last illness, he gave his gold Hampton pocket watch to his [[pastor]], Ralph Blackburn.<ref name=PPHM/> After he mastered ranching, Goodnight was involved in other activities, including the establishment of his Goodnight College in [[Armstrong County, Texas|Armstrong County]] and working as a [[newspaper]]man and a [[banker]]. He lost his life's savings when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[silver]] mine he invested in was nationalized by the Mexican government. He was forced to sell his ranch in 1919 to an [[oil]]man friend, W. J. McAlister, with the provision that Goodnight and his then first wife could stay in the home until they both died.<ref name=globe062012>{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Kevin|title=Renovation winds down at historic Goodnight cattle ranch|url=http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2012-06-09/renovation-winds-down-historic-goodnight-cattle-ranch|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Amarillo Globe News}}</ref>\n\nAfter Molly died in April 1926, Goodnight became ill himself. He was nursed back to health by a distant paternal cousin, 26-year-old [[nurse]] and [[telegraph]] operator from [[Butte, Montana]], named Corinne Goodnight, with whom Charles had been corresponding because of their shared surname.

The interior was restored based on research into the original paint and wallpapers used. In 2005, Amarillo businessman Brent Caviness and a partner donated the home and 30 acres. Mary Ann Goodnight taught children in the bunkhouse. The cowboys slept there at night, and she moved their things aside for school during the day, Goodin said.\n\nThe house had [[electricity]] and sheltered hundreds of ranch workers and cowboys over the years. Beginning in 2006, the Armstrong County Museum in [[Claude, Texas|Claude]] started raising money to restore the structure and make it the centerpiece of the Charles Goodnight Historical Center. Nearly $1.8 million were raised, but another $600,000 are needed. Funds were contributed by several Amarillo-area philanthropies, as well as fund-raisers from the Texas Historical Foundation. The first phase of the restoration, which included work on the foundation, porches, roof, and exterior paint, has been completed. Goodin said that the next step will include interior painting and wallpapering. A small rope bed built by Adam Sheek, Goodnight's second stepfather, a minister and a furniture maker, will be placed in the house upon renovation. Ruth Robinson of [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]], the seat of [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]], who is a great-great-niece of Goodnight's, donated the bed, as well as her mother's [[Queen Victoria|Victorian]] bedroom suite.<ref name=house/> The house was scheduled to open in April 2013.<ref name=restoration/>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Charles Goodnight letter.jpg|thumb|300px|Charles Goodnight letter on his stationery]]\nMontie Goodin, a member of the museum board who was born in the Goodnight house in 1931, two years after Goodnight's death, said that Goodnight had no concept of his own importance: \"It didn't matter who you were, he invited all in.\"<ref name=house>{{cite news |first=Cheryl |last=Berzanskis |title=Museum works to restore Goodnight's home |newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News |date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGoodnight is  presented as a good and decent man. J. Frank Dobie, who knew Goodnight, is quoted in ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle'' as having said: \"I have met a lot of good men, several fine gentlemen, hordes of cunning climbers, plenty of loud-braying asses and plenty of dumb oxen, but I haven't lived long enough or traveled far enough to meet more than two or three men I'd call great. This is a word I will not bandy around. To me, Charles Goodnight was great-natured.\"\n\nOther views have been expressed. In Time-Life's 1973 publication ''The Cowboys'', the author states (p.&nbsp;62): \"Goodnight was no better than the rest. Once when his wife expressed shock at some vigilante hangings ('I understand', she exclaimed, 'they hanged them to a telegraph pole!') Charlie replied quietly, 'Well, I don't think it hurt the telegraph pole.' What she didn't know was that the victims had actually been strung up with Goodnight's full approval.\" The men hung were caught in the act of murder and cattle rustling.\n\nThe western-themed sculptor [[Grant Speed]]'s depiction of Goodnight is housed in the Square House Museum in the city of [[Panhandle, Texas|Panhandle]]. In 2010, another of Speed's sculptures of Goodnight sold at auction for $5,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altermann.com/gallery/pages/c103u10337.htm|title=2010 March Auction|publisher=altermann.com|accessdate=June 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326030905/http://www.altermann.com/gallery/pages/c103u10337.htm|archivedate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\n\nIn 1935, six years after Goodnight's death, [[Laura Vernon Hamner]], who knew Charles and Molly Goodnight from her time in Claude in Armstrong County, Texas, published a [[fiction]]alized biography of the cattleman entitled, ''The No-Gun Man of Texas.'' The western novelist [[Matt Braun]]'s novel ''Texas Empire'' is based on the life of Goodnight and fictionalizes the founding of the JA Ranch. ''The Goodnight Trail'' is the name of a novel by [[Ralph Compton]]. Similarly, [[Mari Sandoz]]'s ''Old Jules Country'' in the part \"Some dedicated men\" relates the difficulties of Goodnight's cattle drives to Colorado.<ref>[[Mari Sandoz]], ''Old Jules Country'', pp. 171\u2013175</ref> In [[James A. Michener]]'s novel, ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'', the Skimmerhorn Trail is based on the actual Goodnight-Loving Trail. In addition, his name is mentioned in the novel; the character R. J. Poteet appears to have been based on Goodnight.\n \nAll four of [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Lonesome Dove series]] novels include brief appearances by Goodnight. His appearance in the [[prequel]] ''[[Dead Man's Walk]]'' is historically inaccurate. The story takes place during the Santa Fe Expedition of 1841, when Goodnight would have been only five years old. Further, ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'' is a fictionalized account of Goodnight and Loving's third cattle drive. Woodrow F. Call represents Goodnight, Augustus McCrae is Oliver Loving. Though the characters have personalities rather different from their real-life counterparts, the novel borrows heavily from actual events, in particular Loving's ambush by Indians and Goodnight's attentive care as Loving died from an arrow-induced infection. Call returns McCrae's body to Texas, just as Goodnight returned Loving for burial in Weatherford. The marker that Call carves for Deets is based on an epitaph Charles Goodnight created for [[Bose Ikard]], an ex-slave who worked alongside Goodnight most of his life. He also plays his largest role in the final volume, ''[[Streets of Laredo (novel)|Streets of Laredo]]''. He is played in the miniseries  ''[[Dead Man's Walk (miniseries)|Dead Man's Walk]]'' by [[Chris Penn]], in ''[[Comanche Moon (miniseries)|Comanche Moon]]'' by [[Jeremy Ratchford]], and in ''[[Streets of Laredo (miniseries)|Streets of Laredo]]'' by [[James Gammon]].\n\nHistorians John Milton Price (born 1942) of [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], and Byron Price (born 1949), the director of the Charles M. Russell Center at the [[University of Oklahoma]] at [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], will compile a book on Goodnight's life. Entitled ''The Charles Goodnight Papers'', the three-volume work will be published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]], of which Byron Price is also the director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodnightheritage.com/book/byron-price/|title=Byron Price|publisher=goodnightheritage.com|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232924/http://goodnightheritage.com/book/byron-price/|archivedate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In November 2013, the two professors received a $50,000 grant from the Summerlee Foundation in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] to assist in the Goodnight project.

Hagan published ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle'' through the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in Norman. Hagan's short biography, only 147 pages, is the first to re-examine Goodnight's life in some 75 years. He examines Goodnight's friendship with his two great friends, Oliver Loving and Oliver H. Nelson, as well as the clash over grasslands with [[Temple Lea Houston]], youngest son of [[Sam Houston]]. Hagan describes Goodnight as a \"demanding boss, approach[ing] every task himself with all the energy he could muster, and he expected the same ... from those under his direction.\" Whatever tasks were pending, Goodnight thought that he was able to do it better than his hands, and usually could.\" In his last years, Goodnight still tried to finish all work that day, rather than postponing the less critical activities to maximize his declining physical energy.<ref name=wtha>Billy Hathorn, \"Review of ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle''\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 195-196</ref>\n\nThough Goodnight had a profane tongue and consumed [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] moderately on occasion, he would fire any hand caught drinking, [[gambling]], or fighting. Any abuse of horses also met with Goodnight's stern disapproval.<ref name=wtha/>\n\nHagan examines the partnership between Goodnight and Loving and then with John George Adair, an arrangement that succeeded probably because the two strong-willed men were rarely in each other's company. Paraphrasing J. Frank Dobie, Hagan explains the basis of Goodnight's wealth. A steer of 800 pounds brought $64 in Kansas but barely $10 in Texas. So, a herd of 750 animals would net more than $40,000, a large return in the 1870s before the [[inflation]] of [[currency]] and the [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]]. Goodnight's invention of the chuckwagon, the original version drawn by 20 oxen and carrying provisions for 18 men for a 600-mile drive.<ref name=wtha/>\n\nDespite his dominant role in Panhandle history, the aging Goodnight fell upon declining health and financial reverses. He dabbled in a failed venture to produce a Western film and proved unable to make needed investments for his later years. Adair's widow, Cornelia, said that Goodnight lacked business savvy.

He is sometimes known as the \"father of the [[Texas Panhandle]].\" [[Essayist]] and [[historian]] [[J.

Goodnight's father's grave is located in a pasture south of [[Bunker Hill, Illinois]].\n\nGoodnight moved to Texas in 1846 with his mother and [[stepfather]], Hiram Daugherty. In 1856, he became a [[cowboy]] and served with the local [[militia]], fighting against [[Comanche]] raiders. A year later, in 1857, Goodnight joined the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. Goodnight is also known for raising and leading a posse against the [[Comanche]] in 1860 that located the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] camp where [[Cynthia Ann Parker]] was living with her husband, [[Peta Nocona]], then guiding Texas Rangers to the camp, leading to Cynthia Ann's recapture.<ref>S.C. Gwynne, Empire of the Summer Moon. New York: Scribner, 2010, pp. 173-175.</ref> He later made a treaty with her son, [[Quanah Parker]]. His father owned a ranch that expanded to 500 acres.\n\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Most of his time was spent as part of a frontier regiment guarding against raids by Indians.\n\nGoodnight described what it took to become a scout, \"First, he must be born a natural woodsman and have the faculty of never needing a compass except in snow storms or darkness.\"<ref>Goodnight, C., The Making of a Scout, manuscript, [[Panhandle Plains Historical Museum]], Canyon, Texas</ref>\n\n== Cattle ==\n[[Image:Goodnight Trail marker.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The 2,000-mile Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from the [[Texas Panhandle]] and into [[Colorado]] as it headed north into [[Wyoming]].]]\n[[File:Charles Goodnight in Canyon IMG 0074.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Charles Goodnight statue outside of the [[Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum]] at the [[West Texas A&M University]] campus]]\n\nFollowing the war, he became involved in the [[Cowboy|herding]] of feral [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] cattle northward from [[West Texas]] to railroads. This \"making the gather\" was a near-statewide round-up of cattle that had roamed free during the four long years of war. In 1866, [[Oliver Loving]] and he drove their first herd of cattle northward along what would become known as the [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]]. Early in the partnership with Loving, they pastured cattle at such sites as [[Capulin Volcano National Monument|Capulin Mountain]] in northeastern [[New Mexico]]. Goodnight invented the [[chuckwagon]], which was first used on the initial cattle drive. Upon arriving in New Mexico, they formed a partnership with [[New Mexico]] cattleman [[John Chisum]] for future contracts to supply the [[United States Army]] with cattle. After Loving's death, Goodnight and Chisum extended the trail from New Mexico to Colorado, and eventually to [[Wyoming]]. The Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from Belknap, Texas, to Fort Sumner, New Mexico.\n\nGoodnight and Loving were close friends. Goodnight sat by Loving's bed during the two weeks the latter took to die, and reportedly kept a photograph of Loving in his pocket long after his death, and later put a photograph on his desk. As requested by the dying Loving, Goodnight carried the body from New Mexico to [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]] in [[Parker County, Texas|Parker County]] for burial. In [[Larry McMurtry]]'s novel'' [[Lonesome Dove]]'', Gus and Call are schematic representations of Oliver Loving and Charles Goodnight, respectively.\n\nTo take advantage of available grass, timber, water, and game, he founded in 1876 what was to become the first Texas Panhandle ranch, the [[JA Ranch]], in the [[Palo Duro Canyon]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Texas State | first = Historical Commission | title = Charles Goodnight Historical Marker, Armstrong County, Tx | url = http://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=Charles+Goodnight&cnty=armstrong | accessdate = 2008-10-10 }}</ref> of the Texas Panhandle. He partnered with the [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman [[John George Adair]] to create the JA, which stands for \"John Adair\". In 1880, Goodnight was a founder of the Panhandle Stockman's Association. The organization sought to improve cattle-breeding methods and to reduce the threat of [[rustler]]s and [[outlaw]]s. After Adair's death in 1885, Goodnight worked in partnership for a time with Adair's widow [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]].\n\nHe also developed an acquaintanceship with [[W. D. Twichell]], who lived in Amarillo from 1890 to 1918, and surveyed 165 of the 254 Texas counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swco.ttu.edu/abstracts/2614.htm|title=Oral History Collection|publisher=Texas Tech University, Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library|accessdate=May 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725193300/http://swco.ttu.edu/abstracts/2614.htm|archive-date=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter Goodnight had already left the JA, [[Tom Blasingame]] came to the ranch in 1918. Blasingame worked there most of the next 73 years, having, at the time of his death in 1989, become the oldest cowboy in the [[history]] of the [[American West]].\n\n==Bison==\n\nIn addition to raising cattle 1876, the Goodnights preserved a herd of native plains [[American Bison|bison]] that year, which is said to survive to this day in [[Caprock Canyons State Park]]. The herd in Caprock Canyons was actually donated by JA Ranch and no documentation demonstrates that this was the herd preserved by the Goodnights. Bison of this herd were introduced into the [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1902 and into the larger zoos and ranches throughout the nation. He also crossbred the bison with domestic cattle, which he called [[Beefalo|cattalo]]. [[Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones]], a co-founder of [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], [[Kansas]], after meeting with Goodnight in Texas, also bred cattalo, or beefalo, on a ranch near [[Grand Canyon National Park]] in northern [[Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-shgape&month=0008&week=c&msg=4ZaC2nPza053qdx7jtInAg&user=&pw=|title=Buffalo Jones|publisher=h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=September 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306074551/http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-shgape&month=0008&week=c&msg=4ZaC2nPza053qdx7jtInAg&user=&pw=|archive-date=March 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn July 26, 1870, Goodnight married [[Mary Ann (Molly) Goodnight|Mary Ann \"Molly\" Dyer]], a [[teacher]] from Weatherford, west of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. Goodnight developed a practical [[sidesaddle]] for Molly. Though he was not of his wife's denomination, Goodnight donated money to build a [[Methodist]] church in Goodnight. Molly and he also established the Goodnight Academy to offer post[[elementary education]] to hundreds of children of ranchers.\n\nIn his younger years, Goodnight smoked some 50 [[cigar]]s per day, but switched to a [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] in his mature years. He never learned to read or write, but had his wives write letters for him to various individuals, including Quanah Parker. During his last illness, he gave his gold Hampton pocket watch to his [[pastor]], Ralph Blackburn.<ref name=PPHM/> After he mastered ranching, Goodnight was involved in other activities, including the establishment of his Goodnight College in [[Armstrong County, Texas|Armstrong County]] and working as a [[newspaper]]man and a [[banker]]. He lost his life's savings when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[silver]] mine he invested in was nationalized by the Mexican government. He was forced to sell his ranch in 1919 to an [[oil]]man friend, W. J. McAlister, with the provision that Goodnight and his then first wife could stay in the home until they both died.<ref name=globe062012>{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Kevin|title=Renovation winds down at historic Goodnight cattle ranch|url=http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2012-06-09/renovation-winds-down-historic-goodnight-cattle-ranch|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Amarillo Globe News}}</ref>\n\nAfter Molly died in April 1926, Goodnight became ill himself.

The interior was restored based on research into the original paint and wallpapers used. In 2005, Amarillo businessman Brent Caviness and a partner donated the home and 30 acres. Mary Ann Goodnight taught children in the bunkhouse. The cowboys slept there at night, and she moved their things aside for school during the day, Goodin said.\n\nThe house had [[electricity]] and sheltered hundreds of ranch workers and cowboys over the years. Beginning in 2006, the Armstrong County Museum in [[Claude, Texas|Claude]] started raising money to restore the structure and make it the centerpiece of the Charles Goodnight Historical Center. Nearly $1.8 million were raised, but another $600,000 are needed. Funds were contributed by several Amarillo-area philanthropies, as well as fund-raisers from the Texas Historical Foundation. The first phase of the restoration, which included work on the foundation, porches, roof, and exterior paint, has been completed. Goodin said that the next step will include interior painting and wallpapering. A small rope bed built by Adam Sheek, Goodnight's second stepfather, a minister and a furniture maker, will be placed in the house upon renovation. Ruth Robinson of [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]], the seat of [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]], who is a great-great-niece of Goodnight's, donated the bed, as well as her mother's [[Queen Victoria|Victorian]] bedroom suite.<ref name=house/> The house was scheduled to open in April 2013.<ref name=restoration/>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Charles Goodnight letter.jpg|thumb|300px|Charles Goodnight letter on his stationery]]\nMontie Goodin, a member of the museum board who was born in the Goodnight house in 1931, two years after Goodnight's death, said that Goodnight had no concept of his own importance: \"It didn't matter who you were, he invited all in.\"<ref name=house>{{cite news |first=Cheryl |last=Berzanskis |title=Museum works to restore Goodnight's home |newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News |date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGoodnight is  presented as a good and decent man. J. Frank Dobie, who knew Goodnight, is quoted in ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle'' as having said: \"I have met a lot of good men, several fine gentlemen, hordes of cunning climbers, plenty of loud-braying asses and plenty of dumb oxen, but I haven't lived long enough or traveled far enough to meet more than two or three men I'd call great. This is a word I will not bandy around. To me, Charles Goodnight was great-natured.\"\n\nOther views have been expressed. In Time-Life's 1973 publication ''The Cowboys'', the author states (p.&nbsp;62): \"Goodnight was no better than the rest. Once when his wife expressed shock at some vigilante hangings ('I understand', she exclaimed, 'they hanged them to a telegraph pole!') Charlie replied quietly, 'Well, I don't think it hurt the telegraph pole.' What she didn't know was that the victims had actually been strung up with Goodnight's full approval.\" The men hung were caught in the act of murder and cattle rustling.\n\nThe western-themed sculptor [[Grant Speed]]'s depiction of Goodnight is housed in the Square House Museum in the city of [[Panhandle, Texas|Panhandle]]. In 2010, another of Speed's sculptures of Goodnight sold at auction for $5,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altermann.com/gallery/pages/c103u10337.htm|title=2010 March Auction|publisher=altermann.com|accessdate=June 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326030905/http://www.altermann.com/gallery/pages/c103u10337.htm|archivedate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\n\nIn 1935, six years after Goodnight's death, [[Laura Vernon Hamner]], who knew Charles and Molly Goodnight from her time in Claude in Armstrong County, Texas, published a [[fiction]]alized biography of the cattleman entitled, ''The No-Gun Man of Texas.'' The western novelist [[Matt Braun]]'s novel ''Texas Empire'' is based on the life of Goodnight and fictionalizes the founding of the JA Ranch. ''The Goodnight Trail'' is the name of a novel by [[Ralph Compton]]. Similarly, [[Mari Sandoz]]'s ''Old Jules Country'' in the part \"Some dedicated men\" relates the difficulties of Goodnight's cattle drives to Colorado.<ref>[[Mari Sandoz]], ''Old Jules Country'', pp. 171\u2013175</ref> In [[James A. Michener]]'s novel, ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'', the Skimmerhorn Trail is based on the actual Goodnight-Loving Trail. In addition, his name is mentioned in the novel; the character R. J. Poteet appears to have been based on Goodnight.\n \nAll four of [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Lonesome Dove series]] novels include brief appearances by Goodnight. His appearance in the [[prequel]] ''[[Dead Man's Walk]]'' is historically inaccurate. The story takes place during the Santa Fe Expedition of 1841, when Goodnight would have been only five years old. Further, ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'' is a fictionalized account of Goodnight and Loving's third cattle drive. Woodrow F. Call represents Goodnight, Augustus McCrae is Oliver Loving. Though the characters have personalities rather different from their real-life counterparts, the novel borrows heavily from actual events, in particular Loving's ambush by Indians and Goodnight's attentive care as Loving died from an arrow-induced infection. Call returns McCrae's body to Texas, just as Goodnight returned Loving for burial in Weatherford. The marker that Call carves for Deets is based on an epitaph Charles Goodnight created for [[Bose Ikard]], an ex-slave who worked alongside Goodnight most of his life. He also plays his largest role in the final volume, ''[[Streets of Laredo (novel)|Streets of Laredo]]''. He is played in the miniseries  ''[[Dead Man's Walk (miniseries)|Dead Man's Walk]]'' by [[Chris Penn]], in ''[[Comanche Moon (miniseries)|Comanche Moon]]'' by [[Jeremy Ratchford]], and in ''[[Streets of Laredo (miniseries)|Streets of Laredo]]'' by [[James Gammon]].\n\nHistorians John Milton Price (born 1942) of [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], and Byron Price (born 1949), the director of the Charles M. Russell Center at the [[University of Oklahoma]] at [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], will compile a book on Goodnight's life. Entitled ''The Charles Goodnight Papers'', the three-volume work will be published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]], of which Byron Price is also the director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodnightheritage.com/book/byron-price/|title=Byron Price|publisher=goodnightheritage.com|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232924/http://goodnightheritage.com/book/byron-price/|archivedate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In November 2013, the two professors received a $50,000 grant from the Summerlee Foundation in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] to assist in the Goodnight project.

Hagan published ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle'' through the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in Norman. Hagan's short biography, only 147 pages, is the first to re-examine Goodnight's life in some 75 years. He examines Goodnight's friendship with his two great friends, Oliver Loving and Oliver H. Nelson, as well as the clash over grasslands with [[Temple Lea Houston]], youngest son of [[Sam Houston]]. Hagan describes Goodnight as a \"demanding boss, approach[ing] every task himself with all the energy he could muster, and he expected the same ... from those under his direction.\" Whatever tasks were pending, Goodnight thought that he was able to do it better than his hands, and usually could.\" In his last years, Goodnight still tried to finish all work that day, rather than postponing the less critical activities to maximize his declining physical energy.<ref name=wtha>Billy Hathorn, \"Review of ''Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle''\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 195-196</ref>\n\nThough Goodnight had a profane tongue and consumed [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] moderately on occasion, he would fire any hand caught drinking, [[gambling]], or fighting. Any abuse of horses also met with Goodnight's stern disapproval.<ref name=wtha/>\n\nHagan examines the partnership between Goodnight and Loving and then with John George Adair, an arrangement that succeeded probably because the two strong-willed men were rarely in each other's company. Paraphrasing J. Frank Dobie, Hagan explains the basis of Goodnight's wealth. A steer of 800 pounds brought $64 in Kansas but barely $10 in Texas. So, a herd of 750 animals would net more than $40,000, a large return in the 1870s before the [[inflation]] of [[currency]] and the [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]].

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. The Talbot lands in Killycluggin were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to ''Captain Gwilliams'' (i.e. the landlord of Ballyconnell, Captain Thomas Gwyllym) and the tenants as ''Edward Rely & Others''. \n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]),  despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin, despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained.

The character has also been associated with Marvel merchandise including [[clothing]], [[toy]]s, [[trading card]]s, [[animated]] [[television series]], [[video game]]s, and the 2006 superhero feature film, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', in which he was a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and was played by [[Vinnie Jones]].

In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men's headquarters while the team's leader, [[Professor X]], related the character's origin in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\n\nAfter an initial defeat in the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in ''X-Men'' #32\u201333 (May\u2013June 1967), and returned again in ''X-Men'' #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] in ''Doctor Strange'' #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in ''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (January 1973), and the [[Hulk]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #172 (February 1974).\n\nAfter the canceled ''X-Men'' returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in ''X-Men'' #101\u2013103 (October 1975\u2013February 1976). Storylines in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #37\u201338 (April & June 1981) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #229\u2013230 (June\u2013July 1982) explored the Juggernaut's relationship with his ally [[Black Tom Cassidy]].\n\nThe X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984), ''Marvel Team-up'' #150 (February 1985), and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #194 (June 1985). The Juggernaut guest-starred in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #7 (January 1986), battled a new generation of mutants in ''X-Men'' #217\u2013218 (April & June 1987), appeared in a flashback story in ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' #21 (August 1987), and in a humorous episode in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #3 (December 1988).\n\nThe Juggernaut also participated in the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\" storyline in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #411\u2013412 (December 1989) and returned in ''Thor'' #429 (February 1991). Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, [[Cyttorak]], in ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #12 (September 1996) and starring in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997).\n\nIn 1994 Marvel purchased [[Malibu Comics]] and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse. In 1995\u20131996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras, who were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles eventually met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, The All New Exiles vs X-Men, Issue #0, dated October 1995.\n\nThe character appeared in ''Juggernaut: The Eighth Day'' #1 (November 1999) and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 3, Nos. 23\u201325 (December 1999\u2013February 2000) with similarly powered [[Incarnation|avatars]] and attempted a reformation in ''Uncanny X-Men'' # 410\u2013413 (September\u2013December 2002) and ''X-Men'' #162\u2013164 (November 2004\u2013January 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier&mdash;leader of the X-Men&mdash;in ''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in ''Hulk'' #602 (November 2009).\n\nHe appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158, during the ''Fear Itself'' limited series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===1960s===\nCain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who becomes Charles Xavier's stepfather when he marries Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt is partially responsible. Kurt Marko favors Charles and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain resents Charles and bullies him frequently. Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the [[US Army]] and are stationed in [[Korea]]. Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity [[Cyttorak]]. On entering, Marko finds and holds a huge [[ruby]] and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: \"Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!\" The gem channels Cyttorak's power into Marko. The transformation causes a [[cave-in]], and the character is buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men's headquarters.\n\nXavier recounts the Juggernaut's origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion's defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is seen clearly in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] to aid the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s; the Torch generates 'pulses' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a [[telepath]]ic attack by Xavier.<ref>''X-Men'' #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965)</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut returns seeking revenge and is delayed by three of the X-Men while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], aided by the [[:wikt:Astral|astral]] form of mystic [[Doctor Strange]], find and use another jewel of Cyttorak, which banishes the Juggernaut to the \"Crimson Cosmos\", the home dimension of Cyttorak.<ref>''X-Men'' #32-33 (May\u2013June 1967)</ref> When the Juggernaut reappears, the character has gained mystical abilities and briefly battles the mystic [[Doctor Strange]] before being banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] by the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nJuggernaut reappears on Earth through sheer force of will, although the alien dimension caused him to age rapidly. The panicking villain battles former X-Man the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before being drawn back to the same dimension.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (Jan. 1973)</ref> An entity from his prison dimension reverses the aging process and removes the mystical powers on the proviso that the villain never return. The Juggernaut is accidentally pulled back to Earth at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base by an interdimensional device designed to banish the Hulk. The Hulk aids the Juggernaut in escaping from the base but attacks him when the Juggernaut threatens a civilian. During the battle, the Juggernaut's helmet is removed, and he is surprised and defeated by Professor X, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl.<ref name=\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\">''Hulk'' #172 (Feb. 1974)</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut befriends [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the cousin of X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and battles the first generation of new X-Men.

He almost kills Web by accident when he removes her from a life support device, and abandons her.

The government comes along and transports the Juggernaut to a secure facility. Spider-Man sneaks into the facility to ask the Juggernaut who did this to him. Then, a new [[Captain Universe]] breaks into the room and claims he's there to slay the Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #627</ref> Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen who wants revenge on Juggernaut for ruining his life during [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|his previous fight with Spider-Man]] over Madame Web.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #628\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #628</ref> When he insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves Nguyen and enters the Juggernaut.

Following [[Luke Cage]]'s appointment as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Cain is brought up for suggestion for the program. While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain. Juggernaut agrees to do whatever Luke says, partly because he is now suffused with nanomachines which can affect him in his weakened state.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' # 144</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy that was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]: God of Fear lands near Juggernaut. Juggernaut lifts it and becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. His transformation is enough to level the Raft, causing a mass prison break.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #2</ref> Kuurth makes his way to California and fights the X-Men. Magik, Colossus, and Shadowcat go to Cyttorak's dimension and inform it that the Serpent has control over Juggernaut. Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak, who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut's powers. However, the entity transfers the Juggernaut's powers to Colossus instead. Colossus is able to turn the tide on Kuurth before Kuurth is teleported away by the Serpent.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #540\u2013542</ref> During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth is defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor and loses his hammer when the Serpent is killed by Thor.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref>\n\nCain Marko, apparently having been incarcerated after the events of ''Fear Itself'', having lost the power of both Kuurth and Cyttorak (but retaining his enormous physique) is released into military custody. Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more, just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allows the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet, as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko's release back through time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #182</ref> He soon loses these borrowed powers again and lives in solitude in the desert, still, it seems, super-strong, although not mystically-empowered.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #183</ref> Meanwhile, Magik purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #20</ref>\n\nAfter a time, Cyttorak causes the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and emit a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut. Cain Marko, finally having found peace\u2014even tending a vegetable garden\u2014senses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the [[Vanisher]] to take him to the Gem's location. He comes into conflict with a team of X-Men (having been alerted by Colossus, who also perceived the call), as well as seekers of the Juggernaut's power such as [[Man-Killer]]. Marko and Colossus struggle with one another, only to realize that they have the same goal\u2014to destroy the Crimson Gem and prevent another avatar being empowered. Ahmet Adbol, the former [[Living Monolith]], claims the Gem and is transformed into an amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #16\u201317</ref> As the colossal new Juggernaut wreaks havoc in the countryside, Colossus invokes Cyttorak, and the god responds to his former exemplar. Arguing that the Monolith-Juggernaut will eventually fail Cyttorak, as all his former avatars have done, Colossus challenges him to try something new: empower him enough to kill Cyttorak himself. Apparently daunted by this prospect, the god withdraws his power from Ahmet Abdol and instead empowers another avatar, to a greater extent than any Juggernaut has ever been. However, the new avatar is not Colossus, but once more Cain Marko. Marko is full of rage, which he focuses on the X-Men and specifically Cyclops (who isn't even present), for killing Professor Xavier. Now more powerful than ever and stripped of even his last weaknesses, he feels that Charles Xavier was the only one who ever truly believed in Cain Marko. Colossus attempts to battle the empowered Juggernaut, but dodges Cain's blows rather than fighting him head on. Peter eventually \"cheats\" and strikes the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, but in the end, he is seen rising from the waves once again.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #18\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut and Black Tom resurface attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref>\n\nCain next appears in ''Iceman'' #5, still looking for those responsible who killed his half-brother Charles Xavier. He runs into Iceman, who's having family issues of his own. Bobby, thankful for the distraction, engages Cain. At the end of the fight, Iceman encases Juggernaut in an ice cage and rockets him into the nearby river via ice elevator sling-shot. Then he creates some ice simulacrum that carry/swim him down river, removing Cain from the area altogether.<ref>''Iceman'' #5</ref>\n\nA continuation where ''Iceman'' #5 left off, Cain is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is being flown to a secure location but gets accidentally summoned by Dr. Voodoo to the X-Mansion. Cain fights a mixed team of veterans (Rogue, Quicksilver, Wanda, Dr. Voodoo & Wasp) and newbie (Quicksilver's latest girl-friend: Synapse). Once Juggernaut has engaged them, Rogue power punches him away from the team to give them more space. Quicksilver attempts to finish the fight quickly by racing Synapse over to Cain to get his helmet off so she can mentally neutralize him. Pietro quickly gets the helmet off but finds out Cain's wearing a mental protection skull cap underneath. Cain subsequently attacks Synapse, almost killing her. More battle ensues and Dr. Voodoo sends his summoned Cyttorak minions to \"fix\" Cain's armor and thus \"sealing\" him inside his armor. The little Cyttorak builders then carry Cain back into Cyttorak's realm and Dr. Voodoo closes the portal.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers Vol 3'' #29</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWhen Cain Marko finds the Gem of the mystical entity [[Cyttorak]], he is empowered with magical energies and transformed into an immortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] for the entity in question.<ref>''Juggernaut: The 8th Day''; ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #24-25 (Jan.-Feb. 2000)</ref> As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains,<ref name=\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\"/> lifting and using buildings as weapons,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #361 (Nov. 1998)</ref> and extreme durability.<ref name=\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\"/>\n\nJuggernaut is able to generate a mystical [[force shield|force field]] that grants him additional [[invulnerability]] to any physical attack when it is at its maximum.<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\">''X-Men'' #13 (Sept. 1965)</ref> Even when the force field is temporarily absorbed by Thor's hammer, the Juggernaut's natural durability still proves to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor.<ref name=\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\"/> The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion,<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\"/> does not tire from physical activity, and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen.

Trion Juggernaut is capable of altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing and projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals through space-time.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #369</ref>\n\nThe character is vulnerable to [[telepathy|mental attacks]], a weakness that has been exploited via the removal of his helmet, which normally protects him from such.<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\"/> The Juggernaut has circumvented this weakness on occasion by wearing a metal [[Capeline|skullcap]] inside his main helmet.<ref name=\"Marvel Team-Up' 1985\"/> If Juggernaut loses his helmet, he can magically recreate it from available raw materials (as long as he possesses the full power of the gem).<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #628\"/>\n\nAfter Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his strength and durability were raised to higher levels than ever before, and his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 # 19</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe, Cain is a monk who works as a protector of Avalon.

Believing that Xavier's more ruthless methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence and using a telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing what he is up to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #13</ref>\n*In ''What if?'' Vol. 2 #94, in a reality where Cain successfully defeats the X-Men in their first battle, the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] are thus released in mass numbers without the X-Men to oppose them, resulting in Earth's destruction in their subsequent assault. Although Cain eventually destroys the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he is left alone wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other humans, and even animals, having been killed by the radiation released by the Sentinels.

This ability is awakened by the gem of Cyttorak. At some point, he has been caught and placed in stasis at a secure facility. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] releases him to get Xavier's [[Cerebro|computer]] to give to Mystique. Juggernaut betrays Mystique and smashes through the [[X-Mansion|X-Men's mansion]]. The [[X-Men]] and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants team up and defeat Juggernaut by taking off his helmet to allow the Professor to knock him out with mental attacks. In the end, Juggernaut is re-imprisoned, and the X-Men hope the Brotherhood will come to their side eventually.

In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men's headquarters while the team's leader, [[Professor X]], related the character's origin in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\n\nAfter an initial defeat in the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in ''X-Men'' #32\u201333 (May\u2013June 1967), and returned again in ''X-Men'' #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] in ''Doctor Strange'' #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in ''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (January 1973), and the [[Hulk]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #172 (February 1974).\n\nAfter the canceled ''X-Men'' returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in ''X-Men'' #101\u2013103 (October 1975\u2013February 1976). Storylines in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #37\u201338 (April & June 1981) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #229\u2013230 (June\u2013July 1982) explored the Juggernaut's relationship with his ally [[Black Tom Cassidy]].\n\nThe X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984), ''Marvel Team-up'' #150 (February 1985), and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #194 (June 1985). The Juggernaut guest-starred in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #7 (January 1986), battled a new generation of mutants in ''X-Men'' #217\u2013218 (April & June 1987), appeared in a flashback story in ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' #21 (August 1987), and in a humorous episode in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #3 (December 1988).\n\nThe Juggernaut also participated in the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\" storyline in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #411\u2013412 (December 1989) and returned in ''Thor'' #429 (February 1991). Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, [[Cyttorak]], in ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #12 (September 1996) and starring in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997).\n\nIn 1994 Marvel purchased [[Malibu Comics]] and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse. In 1995-1996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras, who were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles eventually met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, The All New Exiles vs X-Men, Issue #0, dated October 1995.\n\nThe character appeared in ''Juggernaut: The Eighth Day'' #1 (November 1999) and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 3, Nos. 23\u201325 (December 1999\u2013February 2000) with similarly powered [[Incarnation|avatars]] and attempted a reformation in ''Uncanny X-Men'' # 410\u2013413 (September\u2013December 2002) and ''X-Men'' #162\u2013164 (November 2004\u2013January 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier&mdash;leader of the X-Men&mdash;in ''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in ''Hulk'' #602 (November 2009).\n\nHe appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158, during the ''Fear Itself'' limited series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===1960s===\nCain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who becomes Charles Xavier's stepfather when he marries Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt is partially responsible. Kurt Marko favors Charles and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain resents Charles and bullies him frequently. Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the [[US Army]] and are stationed in [[Korea]]. Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity [[Cyttorak]]. On entering, Marko finds and holds a huge [[ruby]] and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: \"Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!\" The gem channels Cyttorak's power into Marko. The transformation causes a [[cave-in]], and the character is buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men's headquarters.\n\nXavier recounts the Juggernaut's origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion's defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is seen clearly in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] to aid the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s; the Torch generates 'pulses' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a [[telepath]]ic attack by Xavier.<ref>''X-Men'' #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965)</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut returns seeking revenge and is delayed by three of the X-Men while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], aided by the [[:wikt:Astral|astral]] form of mystic [[Doctor Strange]], find and use another jewel of Cyttorak, which banishes the Juggernaut to the \"Crimson Cosmos\", the home dimension of Cyttorak.<ref>''X-Men'' #32-33 (May\u2013June 1967)</ref> When the Juggernaut reappears, the character has gained mystical abilities and briefly battles the mystic [[Doctor Strange]] before being banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] by the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nJuggernaut reappears on Earth through sheer force of will, although the alien dimension caused him to age rapidly. The panicking villain battles former X-Man the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before being drawn back to the same dimension.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (Jan. 1973)</ref> An entity from his prison dimension reverses the aging process and removes the mystical powers on the proviso that the villain never return. The Juggernaut is accidentally pulled back to Earth at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base by an interdimensional device designed to banish the Hulk. The Hulk aids the Juggernaut in escaping from the base but attacks him when the Juggernaut threatens a civilian. During the battle, the Juggernaut's helmet is removed, and he is surprised and defeated by Professor X, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl.<ref name=\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\">''Hulk'' #172 (Feb. 1974)</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut befriends [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the cousin of X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and battles the first generation of new X-Men.

On arriving in [[New York City]], Tom sends the Juggernaut [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|to capture Madame Web]]; Juggernaut destroys several city blocks in the process, and ignores [[Spider-Man]]'s best efforts to stop him. He almost kills Web by accident when he removes her from a life support device, and abandons her.

Following [[Luke Cage]]'s appointment as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Cain is brought up for suggestion for the program. While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain. Juggernaut agrees to do whatever Luke says, partly because he is now suffused with nanomachines which can affect him in his weakened state.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' # 144</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy that was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]: God of Fear lands near Juggernaut. Juggernaut lifts it and becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. His transformation is enough to level the Raft, causing a mass prison break.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #2</ref> Kuurth makes his way to California and fights the X-Men. Magik, Colossus, and Shadowcat go to Cyttorak's dimension and inform it that the Serpent has control over Juggernaut. Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak, who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut's powers. However, the entity transfers the Juggernaut's powers to Colossus instead. Colossus is able to turn the tide on Kuurth before Kuurth is teleported away by the Serpent.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #540\u2013542</ref> During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth is defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor and loses his hammer when the Serpent is killed by Thor.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref>\n\nCain Marko, apparently having been incarcerated after the events of ''Fear Itself'', having lost the power of both Kuurth and Cyttorak (but retaining his enormous physique) is released into military custody. Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more, just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allows the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet, as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko's release back through time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #182</ref> He soon loses these borrowed powers again and lives in solitude in the desert, still, it seems, super-strong, although not mystically-empowered.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #183</ref> Meanwhile, Magik purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #20</ref>\n\nAfter a time, Cyttorak causes the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and emit a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut. Cain Marko, finally having found peace\u2014even tending a vegetable garden\u2014senses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the [[Vanisher]] to take him to the Gem's location. He comes into conflict with a team of X-Men (having been alerted by Colossus, who also perceived the call), as well as seekers of the Juggernaut's power such as [[Man-Killer]]. Marko and Colossus struggle with one another, only to realize that they have the same goal\u2014to destroy the Crimson Gem and prevent another avatar being empowered. Ahmet Adbol, the former [[Living Monolith]], claims the Gem and is transformed into an amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #16\u201317</ref> As the colossal new Juggernaut wreaks havoc in the countryside, Colossus invokes Cyttorak, and the god responds to his former exemplar. Arguing that the Monolith-Juggernaut will eventually fail Cyttorak, as all his former avatars have done, Colossus challenges him to try something new: empower him enough to kill Cyttorak himself. Apparently daunted by this prospect, the god withdraws his power from Ahmet Abdol and instead empowers another avatar, to a greater extent than any Juggernaut has ever been. However, the new avatar is not Colossus, but once more Cain Marko. Marko is full of rage, which he focuses on the X-Men and specifically Cyclops (who isn't even present), for killing Professor Xavier. Now more powerful than ever and stripped of even his last weaknesses, he feels that Charles Xavier was the only one who ever truly believed in Cain Marko. Colossus attempts to battle the empowered Juggernaut, but dodges Cain's blows rather than fighting him head on. Peter eventually \"cheats\" and strikes the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, but in the end, he is seen rising from the waves once again.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #18\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Juggernaut and Black Tom resurface attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref>\n\nCain next appears in ''Iceman'' #5, still looking for those responsible who killed his half-brother Charles Xavier. He runs into Iceman, who's having family issues of his own. Bobby, thankful for the distraction, engages Cain. At the end of the fight, Iceman encases Juggernaut in an ice cage and rockets him into the nearby river via ice elevator sling-shot. Then he creates some ice simulacrum that carry/swim him down river, removing Cain from the area altogether.<ref>''Iceman'' #5</ref>\n\nA continuation where ''Iceman'' #5 left off, Cain is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is being flown to a secure location but gets accidentally summoned by Dr. Voodoo to the X-Mansion. Cain fights a mixed team of veterans (Rogue, Quicksilver, Wanda, Dr. Voodoo & Wasp) and newbie (Quicksilver's latest girl-friend: Synapse). Once Juggernaut has engaged them, Rogue power punches him away from the team to give them more space. Quicksilver attempts to finish the fight quickly by racing Synapse over to Cain to get his helmet off so she can mentally neutralize him. Pietro quickly gets the helmet off but finds out Cain's wearing a mental protection skull cap underneath. Cain subsequently attacks Synapse, almost killing her. More battle ensues and Dr. Voodoo sends his summoned Cyttorak minions to \"fix\" Cain's armor and thus \"sealing\" him inside his armor. The little Cyttorak builders then carry Cain back into Cyttorak's realm and Dr. Voodoo closes the portal.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers Vol 3'' #29</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWhen Cain Marko finds the Gem of the mystical entity [[Cyttorak]], he is empowered with magical energies and transformed into an immortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] for the entity in question.<ref>''Juggernaut: The 8th Day''; ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #24-25 (Jan.-Feb. 2000)</ref> As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains,<ref name=\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\"/> lifting and using buildings as weapons,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #361 (Nov. 1998)</ref> and extreme durability.<ref name=\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\"/>\n\nJuggernaut is able to generate a mystical [[force shield|force field]] that grants him additional [[invulnerability]] to any physical attack when it is at its maximum.<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\">''X-Men'' #13 (Sept. 1965)</ref> Even when the force field is temporarily absorbed by Thor's hammer, the Juggernaut's natural durability still proves to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor.<ref name=\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\"/> The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion,<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\"/> does not tire from physical activity, and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen.

Trion Juggernaut is capable of altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing and projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals through space-time.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #369</ref>\n\nThe character is vulnerable to [[telepathy|mental attacks]], a weakness that has been exploited via the removal of his helmet, which normally protects him from such.<ref name=\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\"/> The Juggernaut has circumvented this weakness on occasion by wearing a metal [[Capeline|skullcap]] inside his main helmet.<ref name=\"Marvel Team-Up' 1985\"/> If Juggernaut loses his helmet, he can magically recreate it from available raw materials (as long as he possesses the full power of the gem).<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #628\"/>\n\nAfter Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his strength and durability were raised to higher levels than ever before, and his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 # 19</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe, Cain is a monk who works as a protector of Avalon.

Believing that Xavier's more ruthless methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence and using a telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing what he is up to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #13</ref>\n*In ''What if?'' Vol. 2 #94, in a reality where Cain successfully defeats the X-Men in their first battle, the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] are thus released in mass numbers without the X-Men to oppose them, resulting in Earth's destruction in their subsequent assault. Although Cain eventually destroys the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he is left alone wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other humans, and even animals, having been killed by the radiation released by the Sentinels.

This ability is awakened by the gem of Cyttorak. At some point, he has been caught and placed in stasis at a secure facility. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] releases him to get Xavier's [[Cerebro|computer]] to give to Mystique. Juggernaut betrays Mystique and smashes through the [[X-Mansion|X-Men's mansion]]. The [[X-Men]] and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants team up and defeat Juggernaut by taking off his helmet to allow the Professor to knock him out with mental attacks. In the end, Juggernaut is re-imprisoned, and the X-Men hope the Brotherhood will come to their side eventually.

The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n=== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ===\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n===2018: Second major debut, more major changes===\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n===2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment===\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour. Auditions were held in April to find members for a third iteration of the group.\n\n==Members==\n===Current===\n*Toggy\n*Ito Musensiteebu\n*Chant Monkee\n*Neo Trees\n\n===Former===\n====First

Cyzo}}</ref>  Their music videos touch on themes such as point-of-view pornography and sexual violence, attracting both positive and negative attitudes from viewers. Pour Lui notes that many are difficult to watch, and Avex staff member Ryuta Ochi explains \"They [Bis] wanted to make a deliberate uglification of idol events.\"<ref name=\"cbw\">{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Clive|date=September 2013|title=Trash Yr Idols|journal=The Wire|issue=355|page=12}}</ref> The image of a typical idol is generally accepted as being pure and good-natured, which Bis reject. A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Before the single's release, the music video for \"Idol\" was uploaded to Bis' official YouTube channel and was met with criticism; the once shocking, [[punk rock]] Bis were singing a very typical cute idol song, wearing maid outfits and simpering. However, this video (with its deliberate parody of idol groups) was revealed to be a joke at the expense of their fans. It was then made private and a new video for a different song, titled \"Idol\", was released. \"Idol\"'s [[metal]]-inspired sound was strongly different from the exaggerated cuteness of \"Idol\".

The concert was the longest ever performed by the group, consisting of 48 songs (including guest appearances by ex.members Rio Michibayashi, Rina Yokoyama and Yukiko Nakayama). Nearly every song released by the group was performed, and the setlist was composed so that newer songs were performed first and older songs were performed last. At the end of the concert, the future paths of each of the members were announced: First Summer Uika and Nozomi Hirano would form [[Billie Idle]]; Saki Kamiya would form Pla2me with Mari Mizuta; Megumi Koshouji would form Maison Book Girl; Tentenko would start a solo/DJ career; Pour Lui would continue to perform with Lui Frontic Matsukuma Japan. In addition, in classic Bis style, a concert by \"Ex. Bis\" was announced for the next day at the Shimokitazawa Shelter. Tickets were exclusively 30,000 yen, including an \"all you can eat buffet\" (revealed on the day to be McDonald's). This July 9 show marked the true end of Bis.\n\n===Post disbandment===\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Junnosuke Watanabe, along with members of the team that initially conceived Bis would be putting together a successor group [[BiSH|Bish]].

The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n=== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ===\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n===2018: Second major debut, more major changes===\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n===2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment===\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour. Auditions were held in April to find members for a third iteration of the group.\n\n==Members==\n===Current===\n*Toggy\n*Ito Musensiteebu\n*Chant Monkee\n*Neo Trees\n\n===Former===\n====First

Cyzo}}</ref>  Their music videos touch on themes such as point-of-view pornography and sexual violence, attracting both positive and negative attitudes from viewers. Pour Lui notes that many are difficult to watch, and Avex staff member Ryuta Ochi explains \"They [Bis] wanted to make a deliberate uglification of idol events.\"<ref name=\"cbw\">{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Clive|date=September 2013|title=Trash Yr Idols|journal=The Wire|issue=355|page=12}}</ref> The image of a typical idol is generally accepted as being pure and good-natured, which Bis reject. A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]].

From the mid-1940s onwards, SNP policy was [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributionist]] in relation to land and in favour of \u2018the diffusion of economic power\u2019, including the [[decentralisation]] of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/><ref name=\"Hassan2009120\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=120}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically, with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban, industrial Scotland, and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[trade union]]s and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name=\"Brand199032\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=32|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=208}}</ref> The emergence of [[William Wolfe|Billy Wolfe]] as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift. By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members.<ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\"/> In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the [[United States|US]] [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine base at the [[Holy Loch]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nFundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it.
