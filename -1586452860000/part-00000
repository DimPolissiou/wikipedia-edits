The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.
