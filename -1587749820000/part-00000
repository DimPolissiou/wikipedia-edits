In Arabic, the term ''tajw\u012bd'' is derived from the [[triliteral]] root ''{{transl|ar|ALA|j-w-d}}'', meaning enhancement or to make something excellent. Technically, it means giving every letter its right in reciting the Qur'an.\n\n==History==\nThe history of tajwid is tied to the history of [[qira'at]], as each reciter had their own set of tajwid rules, with much overlap between them.\n\n[[Abu Ubaid al-Qasim bin Salam]] (774 - 838 CE) was the first to develop a recorded science for [[tajwid]], giving the rules of tajwid names and putting it into writing in his book called ''al-Qiraat.'' He wrote about 25 reciters, including the 7 mutawatir reciters.<ref name=\"ajaja\">{{cite web |last1=Ajaja |first1=Abdurrazzak |title=\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a : The readings |url=https://scientificsentence.net/newArabic/tajweed/index.php?key=yes&Integer=the_10_readings}}</ref> He made the reality, transmitted through reciters of every generation, a science with defined rules, terms, and enunciation.<ref name=\"shadee\">{{cite book |last1=el-Masry |first1=Shadee |title=The Science of Tajwid |publisher=Safina Society |page=8 |url=https://myarkview.org/courses/322185/lectures/5481431 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=shadee}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What is Tajweed? |url=https://www.onlinequranteachers.com/what-is-tajweed/ |website=Online Quran Teachers |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Abu Bakr Ibn Muj\u0101hid]] (859 - 936 CE) wrote a book called ''Kitab al-Sab\u2019 fil-qir\u0101\u2019\u0101t'' \"The Seven of the [[Qira'at|Recitations]].\" He is the first to limit the number of [[Qira'at|reciters]] to the seven known.\n\nImam [[Al-Shatibi]] (1320 - 1388 CE) wrote a poem outlining the two most famous ways passed down from each of seven strong imams, known as ''ash-Shatibiyyah.'' In it, he documented the rules of recitation of Naafi\u2019, Ibn Katheer, Abu \u2018Amr, Ibn \u2018Aamir, \u2018Aasim, al-Kisaa\u2019i, and Hamzah. It is 1173 lines long and a major reference for the seven qira\u2019aat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ijazah in Ash-Shatibiyyah |url=https://www.onlinequranteachers.com/course/ijazah-in-ash-shatibiyyah/ |website=Online Quran Teachers}}</ref>\n\n[[Ibn al-Jazari]] (1350 - 1429 CE) wrote two large poems about [[Qira'at]] and tajwid. One was Durrat Al-Maa'nia ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u064a\u0629}}) , in the readings of three major reciters, added to the seven in the Shatibiyyah, making it ten. The other is Tayyibat An-Nashr ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0634\u0631}}), which is 1014 lines on the ten major reciters in great detail, of which he also wrote a commentary.\n\n==Religious Obligation==\nKnowledge of the actual ''tajw\u012bd'' rules is a community duty (''[[fard|far\u1e0d al-kif\u0101ya]]''), meaning that at least one person in every community must know it. There is a difference of opinion on the ruling for individuals.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the speaking and singing voices of Kristoff's pet reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the other reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n**  [[Frank Welker]] as the vocal effects for Sven and the reindeer.\n* [[Sterling K.

At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Into the Unknown (Disney song)|Into the Unknown]]\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words, according to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, so please do not expand this section too much and do not include unnecessary details. -->\nKing Agnarr of Arendelle tells a story to his young children, [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]] and [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], that their grandfather, King Runeard, had established a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest. However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

Nathan plays Harry Schechter, heir to a [[Hollywood]] studio forced to make a [[musical film|musical comedy]] [[pornographic movie|porno]] in order to stave off bankruptcy. The movie features a series of farcical lewd musical numbers in the style of classical Hollywood musical comedies including: \"Orgasm\", \"Lesbian Butch Dyke\", and \"Dancing Dildos.\" The movie has a low-budget feel, with a \"musical-within-a-movie\" theme in the tradition of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', but with satirical sexual humor.\n\nAn early staple of [[Cinemax]], it has become a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]] since its initial release and was released on DVD in 2001 and is currently available on Blu-ray on Kritzerland. It was one of several farcical musical-comedy collaborations between Kimmel (who also co-starred in the movie) and Williams, along with ''[[The Creature Wasn't Nice]]'' in 1981. Originally distributed by Paramount Pictures in 1976, it was picked up by World-Northal in 1977 and re-released to great acclaim, first in New York, where it played for three months exclusively at the 68th Street Playhouse before gaining wider distribution.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received polarizing reviews.

It says that people have a moral responsibility to break unjust laws and to take direct action rather than waiting potentially forever for justice to come through the courts. Responding to being referred to as an \"outsider\", King writes, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\"\n\nThe letter, written during the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign]], was widely published, and became an important text for the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Birmingham campaign]] began on April 3, 1963, with coordinated marches and sit-ins against [[Racism in the United States|racism]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] campaign was coordinated by the [[Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights]] (ACMHR) and King's [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). On April 10, Circuit Judge W. A. Jenkins Jr. issued a blanket injunction against \"parading, demonstrating, boycotting, trespassing and picketing.\" Leaders of the campaign announced they would disobey the ruling.<ref>{{cite news |date=April 11, 1963 |title=Negroes To Defy Ban |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YREdAAAAIBAJ&pg=7376%2C1391871 |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |volume=145 |issue=101 |page=21 |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> On April 12, King was arrested with SCLC activist [[Ralph Abernathy]], ACMHR and SCLC official [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], and other marchers, while thousands of African Americans dressed for [[Good Friday]] looked on.{{sfn|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\u201d}}\n\nKing was met with unusually harsh conditions in the Birmingham jail.<ref>{{harvnb|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\"}}: \"King was placed alone in a dark cell, with no mattress, and denied a phone call. Was Connor's aim, as some thought, to break him?\"</ref> An ally smuggled in a newspaper from April 12, which contained \"[[A Call for Unity]]\", a statement by eight white Alabama clergymen against King and his methods.{{sfn|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\"}} The letter provoked King, and he began to write a response to the newspaper itself. King writes in ''Why We Can't Wait'': \"Begun on the margins of the newspaper in which the statement appeared while I was in jail, the letter was continued on scraps of writing paper supplied by a friendly black [[Trusty system (prison)|trusty]]<!-- NOTE! This is not a misspelling of trustee. Please don't \"correct\" it. Thank you,-->, and concluded on a pad my attorneys were eventually permitted to leave me.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=64}}\n\n== Summary and themes ==\nKing's letter, dated April 16, 1963,<ref name=King1963/> responded to several criticisms made by the \"[[A Call for Unity]]\" clergymen, who agreed that social injustices existed but argued that the battle against racial segregation should be fought solely in the courts, not the streets. As a minister, King responded to these criticisms on religious grounds.  As an activist challenging an haha your annoying and a brat who ever is reading this god bless you\nsocial system, he argued on legal, political, and historical grounds.  As an African American, he spoke of the country's oppression of black people, including himself.  As an orator, he used many persuasive techniques to reach the hearts and minds of his audience.  Altogether, King's letter was a powerful defense of the motivations, tactics, and goals of the Birmingham campaign and the Civil Rights Movement more generally.\n\nKing began the letter by responding to the criticism that he and his fellow activists were \"outsiders\" causing trouble in the streets of Birmingham.  To this, King referred to his responsibility as the leader of the SCLC, which had numerous affiliated organizations throughout the South. \"I was invited\" by our Birmingham affiliate \"because injustice is here\", in what is probably the most racially divided city in the country, with its brutal police, unjust courts, and many \"unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches.\"{{sfn|King|1964|pp=65\u201366}} Referring to his belief that all communities and states were interrelated, King wrote, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly&nbsp;... Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.\"<ref name=King>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther|title=Letter from a Birmingham Jail|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>  King also warned that if white people successfully rejected his nonviolent activists as rabble-rousing outside agitators, this could encourage millions of African Americans to \"seek solace and security in [[Black nationalism|black nationalist ideologies]], a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=76}}\n\nThe clergymen also disapproved of tensions created by public actions such as sit-ins and marches.  To this, King confirmed that he and his fellow demonstrators were indeed using nonviolent direct action in order to create \"constructive\" tension.{{sfn|King|1964|p=65}} This tension was intended to compel meaningful negotiation with the white power structure, without which true civil rights could never be achieved.  Citing previous failed negotiations, King wrote that the black community was left with \"no alternative.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=65}} \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=68}}\n\nThe clergymen also disapproved of the timing of public actions. In response, King said that recent decisions by the SCLC to delay its efforts for tactical reasons showed they were behaving responsibly. He also referred to the broader scope of history, when \"'Wait' has almost always meant 'Never.'\"<ref name=\"King\"/>  Declaring that African Americans had waited for these God-given and constitutional rights long enough, King {{cn span|quoted Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], who said in 1958|reason=Are we sure that Earl Warren said this? Our article \"Justice delayed is justice denied\" says nothing of the sort.|date=March 2020}} that \"[[Justice delayed is justice denied|justice too long delayed is justice denied]].\"<ref name=\"King\"/>  Listing numerous ongoing injustices toward black people, including himself, King said, \"Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, 'Wait.'\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=69}} Along similar lines, King also lamented the \"myth concerning time,\" by which white moderates assumed that progress toward equal rights was inevitable, so assertive activism was unnecessary.{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}} King called it a \"tragic misconception of time\" to assume that its mere passage \"will inevitably cure all ills.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}} Progress takes time as well as the \"tireless efforts\" of dedicated people of good will.{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}}\n\nAgainst the clergymen's assertion that demonstrations could be illegal, King argued that not only was civil disobedience justified in the face of unjust laws, but it was necessary and even patriotic:\n{{quote|The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with [[St. Augustine]] that \"an unjust law is no law at all.\"}}\n\nAnticipating the claim that one cannot determine such things, he again cited Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], saying any law not rooted in \"eternal law and [[Natural law#Christianity|natural law]]\" is not just, while any law that \"uplifts human personality\" is just. Segregation undermines human personality, ergo, is unjust. Furthermore:\n\n:\"I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=72}}\n\nKing cites [[Martin Buber]] and [[Paul Tillich]] with further examples from the past and present of what makes laws just or unjust. For example, \"A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} In terms of obedience to the law, King says citizens have \"not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws,\" and at the same time \"to disobey unjust laws.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} King stated that it is not morally wrong to disobey a law that pertains to one group of people differently than another. Alabama has used \"all sorts of devious methods\" to deny its black citizens their right to vote and thus preserve its unjust laws and broader system of white supremacy.{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} That segregation laws are immoral and unjust \"because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.\"{{sfn|King|1964|pp=70\u201371}} Even some just laws, such as permit requirements for public marches, are unjust when used to uphold an unjust system.\n\nKing addressed the accusation that the Civil Rights Movement was \"extreme\"; first, by disputing the label but then accepting it.  Compared to other movements at the time, King finds himself as a moderate. However, in his devotion to his cause, King refers to himself as an extremist. Jesus and other great reformers were extremists: \"So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?\"<ref name=King1963>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther|title=Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1963 draft|publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/letter-birmingham-jail|access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> King's discussion of extremism implicitly responded to numerous \"moderate\" objections to the ongoing movement, such as President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s claim that he could not meet with civil rights leaders because doing so would require him to meet with the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|McCarthy|2010|p=16}}\n\nKing expressed general frustration with both white moderates and certain \"opposing forces in the Negro community.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=75}} He wrote that white moderates, including clergymen, posed a challenge comparable to that of white supremacists, in the sense that, \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.  Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=73}} King asserted that the white church needed to take a principled stand or risk being \"dismissed as an irrelevant social club.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=80}} Regarding the black community, King wrote that we need not follow \"the 'do-nothingism' of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=75}}\n\nIn the closing, King criticized the clergy's praise of the Birmingham police for maintaining order nonviolently.  The recent public displays of nonviolence by the police were in stark contrast to their typical treatment of black people, and, as public relations, helped \"to preserve the evil system of segregation.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=80}} Not only is it wrong to use immoral means to achieve moral ends, but also \"to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=82}} Instead of the police, King praised the nonviolent demonstrators in Birmingham, \"for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.  One day the South will recognize its real heroes.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=83}}\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS 4.jpg|thumb|upright|King promotes ''Why We Can't Wait'']]\nKing wrote the first part of the letter on the margins of a newspaper, which was the only paper available to him.

Responding to being referred to as an \"outsider\", King writes, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\"\n\nThe letter, written during the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign]], was widely published, and became an important text for the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Birmingham campaign]] began on April 3, 1963, with coordinated marches and sit-ins against [[Racism in the United States|racism]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] campaign was coordinated by the [[Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights]] (ACMHR) and King's [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). On April 10, Circuit Judge W. A. Jenkins Jr. issued a blanket injunction against \"parading, demonstrating, boycotting, trespassing and picketing.\" Leaders of the campaign announced they would disobey the ruling.<ref>{{cite news |date=April 11, 1963 |title=Negroes To Defy Ban |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YREdAAAAIBAJ&pg=7376%2C1391871 |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |volume=145 |issue=101 |page=21 |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> On April 12, King was arrested with SCLC activist [[Ralph Abernathy]], ACMHR and SCLC official [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], and other marchers, while thousands of African Americans dressed for [[Good Friday]] looked on.{{sfn|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\u201d}}\n\nKing was met with unusually harsh conditions in the Birmingham jail.<ref>{{harvnb|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\"}}: \"King was placed alone in a dark cell, with no mattress, and denied a phone call. Was Connor's aim, as some thought, to break him?\"</ref> An ally smuggled in a newspaper from April 12, which contained \"[[A Call for Unity]]\", a statement by eight white Alabama clergymen against King and his methods.{{sfn|Rieder|2013|loc=ch. \"Meet Me in Galilee\"}} The letter provoked King, and he began to write a response to the newspaper itself. King writes in ''Why We Can't Wait'': \"Begun on the margins of the newspaper in which the statement appeared while I was in jail, the letter was continued on scraps of writing paper supplied by a friendly black [[Trusty system (prison)|trusty]]<!-- NOTE! This is not a misspelling of trustee. Please don't \"correct\" it. Thank you,-->, and concluded on a pad my attorneys were eventually permitted to leave me.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=64}}\n\n== Summary and themes ==\nKing's letter, dated April 16, 1963,<ref name=King1963/> responded to several criticisms made by the \"[[A Call for Unity]]\" clergymen, who agreed that social injustices existed but argued that the battle against racial segregation should be fought solely in the courts, not the streets. As a minister, King responded to these criticisms on religious grounds.  As an activist challenging an entrenched social system, he argued on legal, political, and historical grounds.  As an African American, he spoke of the country's oppression of black people, including himself.  As an orator, he used many persuasive techniques to reach the hearts and minds of his audience.  Altogether, King's letter was a powerful defense of the motivations, tactics, and goals of the Birmingham campaign and the Civil Rights Movement more generally.\n\nKing began the letter by responding to the criticism that he and his fellow activists were \"outsiders\" causing trouble in the streets of Birmingham.  To this, King referred to his responsibility as the leader of the SCLC, which had numerous affiliated organizations throughout the South. \"I was invited\" by our Birmingham affiliate \"because injustice is here\", in what is probably the most racially divided city in the country, with its brutal police, unjust courts, and many \"unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches.\"{{sfn|King|1964|pp=65\u201366}} Referring to his belief that all communities and states were interrelated, King wrote, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly&nbsp;... Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.\"<ref name=King>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther|title=Letter from a Birmingham Jail|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>  King also warned that if white people successfully rejected his nonviolent activists as rabble-rousing outside agitators, this could encourage millions of African Americans to \"seek solace and security in [[Black nationalism|black nationalist ideologies]], a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=76}}\n\nThe clergymen also disapproved of tensions created by public actions such as sit-ins and marches.  To this, King confirmed that he and his fellow demonstrators were indeed using nonviolent direct action in order to create \"constructive\" tension.{{sfn|King|1964|p=65}} This tension was intended to compel meaningful negotiation with the white power structure, without which true civil rights could never be achieved.  Citing previous failed negotiations, King wrote that the black community was left with \"no alternative.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=65}} \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=68}}\n\nThe clergymen also disapproved of the timing of public actions. In response, King said that recent decisions by the SCLC to delay its efforts for tactical reasons showed they were behaving responsibly. He also referred to the broader scope of history, when \"'Wait' has almost always meant 'Never.'\"<ref name=\"King\"/>  Declaring that African Americans had waited for these God-given and constitutional rights long enough, King {{cn span|quoted Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], who said in 1958|reason=Are we sure that Earl Warren said this? Our article \"Justice delayed is justice denied\" says nothing of the sort.|date=March 2020}} that \"[[Justice delayed is justice denied|justice too long delayed is justice denied]].\"<ref name=\"King\"/>  Listing numerous ongoing injustices toward black people, including himself, King said, \"Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, 'Wait.'\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=69}} Along similar lines, King also lamented the \"myth concerning time,\" by which white moderates assumed that progress toward equal rights was inevitable, so assertive activism was unnecessary.{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}} King called it a \"tragic misconception of time\" to assume that its mere passage \"will inevitably cure all ills.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}} Progress takes time as well as the \"tireless efforts\" of dedicated people of good will.{{sfn|King|1964|p=74}}\n\nAgainst the clergymen's assertion that demonstrations could be illegal, King argued that not only was civil disobedience justified in the face of unjust laws, but it was necessary and even patriotic:\n{{quote|The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with [[St. Augustine]] that \"an unjust law is no law at all.\"}}\n\nAnticipating the claim that one cannot determine such things, he again cited Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], saying any law not rooted in \"eternal law and [[Natural law#Christianity|natural law]]\" is not just, while any law that \"uplifts human personality\" is just. Segregation undermines human personality, ergo, is unjust. Furthermore:\n\n:\"I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=72}}\n\nKing cites [[Martin Buber]] and [[Paul Tillich]] with further examples from the past and present of what makes laws just or unjust. For example, \"A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} In terms of obedience to the law, King says citizens have \"not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws,\" and at the same time \"to disobey unjust laws.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} King stated that it is not morally wrong to disobey a law that pertains to one group of people differently than another. Alabama has used \"all sorts of devious methods\" to deny its black citizens their right to vote and thus preserve its unjust laws and broader system of white supremacy.{{sfn|King|1964|p=71}} That segregation laws are immoral and unjust \"because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.\"{{sfn|King|1964|pp=70\u201371}} Even some just laws, such as permit requirements for public marches, are unjust when used to uphold an unjust system.\n\nKing addressed the accusation that the Civil Rights Movement was \"extreme\"; first, by disputing the label but then accepting it.  Compared to other movements at the time, King finds himself as a moderate. However, in his devotion to his cause, King refers to himself as an extremist. Jesus and other great reformers were extremists: \"So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?\"<ref name=King1963>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther|title=Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1963 draft|publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/letter-birmingham-jail|access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> King's discussion of extremism implicitly responded to numerous \"moderate\" objections to the ongoing movement, such as President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s claim that he could not meet with civil rights leaders because doing so would require him to meet with the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|McCarthy|2010|p=16}}\n\nKing expressed general frustration with both white moderates and certain \"opposing forces in the Negro community.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=75}} He wrote that white moderates, including clergymen, posed a challenge comparable to that of white supremacists, in the sense that, \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.  Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=73}} King asserted that the white church needed to take a principled stand or risk being \"dismissed as an irrelevant social club.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=80}} Regarding the black community, King wrote that we need not follow \"the 'do-nothingism' of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=75}}\n\nIn the closing, King criticized the clergy's praise of the Birmingham police for maintaining order nonviolently.  The recent public displays of nonviolence by the police were in stark contrast to their typical treatment of black people, and, as public relations, helped \"to preserve the evil system of segregation.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=80}} Not only is it wrong to use immoral means to achieve moral ends, but also \"to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=82}} Instead of the police, King praised the nonviolent demonstrators in Birmingham, \"for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.  One day the South will recognize its real heroes.\"{{sfn|King|1964|p=83}}\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS 4.jpg|thumb|upright|King promotes ''Why We Can't Wait'']]\nKing wrote the first part of the letter on the margins of a newspaper, which was the only paper available to him.

The game is traditionally played as a diversion from regular chess both over the board and [[internet chess server|online]].

Each team member faces one opponent of the other team. Partners sit next to each other and one player has black, while the other has white. Each player plays the opponent as in a standard [[rules of chess|chess]] game, with the exception of the rules specified below.<ref>Bughouse has many variations and there is no international standard. The rules below are in accordance with the [http://www.uschess.org/tournaments/2006/2006bughouse.pdf US chess federation], the rules as applied on the chess servers [[Free Internet Chess Server]] and [[Internet Chess Club]] and the [http://bughouse.info Berlin bughouse tournament]. In the case rules contradict, alternatives are listed. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Captured pieces ===\nA player capturing a [[chess piece|piece]] immediately passes that piece to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place one of these pieces on the board (as in [[shogi]] and [[crazyhouse]]), called ''dropping'' the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, [[pawn (chess)|pawns]] may not be dropped on the first or last {{chessgloss|rank}}. Dropped pawns may [[promotion (chess)|promote]], but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 15</ref> A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on the table in front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.\n\n=== Clock and completion of a move ===\nBughouse chess is usually played with [[chess clock]]s to prevent players from waiting indefinitely\nfor a piece. Clocks are placed on the outside so that each player can see both clocks. At the\nstart of the game, the players with the black pieces start the clocks simultaneously.\nBughouse is usually played using {{chessgloss|clock move}}, which allows touching of pieces. A move is completed only when the clock is pressed. {{chessgloss|touched piece rule|Touch move}} is practiced to a lesser extent.<ref>See for example the [http://pion.ch/Bug/ruleseng.html rules of the Geneva bughouse tournament]. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref> When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.\n\nBughouse can be played without a clock, but then there is usually a rule preventing a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond the time that it takes for their partner to make three moves.<ref name=cvv>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.chessvariants.org/multiplayer.dir/tandem.html\n |last1=Bodlaender\n |first1=Hans\n |authorlink1=Hans Bodlaender\n |last2=Scott\n |first2=Jay\n |last3=Junta\n |first3=Cristobal Joseevich\n |title=Bughouse and Tandem Chess\n |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]]\n |date=March 18, 2002\n |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}</ref> A team must have one checkmate to win. If they draw, it's over.\n\n=== End of the game ===\nThe match ends when either of the games on the two boards ends. A game is won when one player\ngets [[checkmate]]d, resigns, forfeits on time or when an illegal move\nis made in which the offending side is caught. The match can be drawn [[draw by agreement|by agreement]] or when two players run out of time or are checkmated simultaneously. Depending on (local) rules [[threefold repetition]] applies, in which case the reserve of pieces is not taken into account.<ref>For instance, the threefold repetition applies on [[Free Internet Chess Server|FICS]] but not on [[Internet Chess Club]].</ref>\n\nAlternatively, when one board finishes, play can continue on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still be dropped, but no new pieces are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.<ref name=\"cvv\" />\n\n=== Communication ===\nPartners are normally allowed to talk to each other during the game. They can for instance ask for a specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or ask their partner to stall. Shouts like \"Knight mates!\" or \"Don't let him have a Bishop!\" are common, and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.<ref>See Article nr. 12, [http://www.uschess.org/tournaments/2006/2006bughouse.pdf US Chess Federation bughouse rules]. Accessed August 27, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Two-player and six-player variations ==\nIt is possible to play the game with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one [[Game clock|clock]] by playing the boards in a specific order (White A, White B, Black B, Black A) and pressing the clock after each move. This variation is suitable for play [[correspondence chess|by mail]].<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 108</ref>\n\nBughouse can be played with three or more boards. The game is played in exactly the same way as normal bughouse with boards placed with alternating colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three-board bughouse chess, the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces.<ref name=mhtf>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 34\u201337</ref> The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.\n\n== Strategy ==\n\n=== Material ===\nIn chess, a minor material advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, there is no [[Chess endgame|endgame]] play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.<ref name=\"mhtf\" />\n\nA scoring system to evaluate material is to add up the [[Chess piece relative value|piece values]] of the material on the board. In chess, when a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] equals one unit, a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] or [[knight (chess)|knight]] is worth three, a [[rook (chess)|rook]] five and a [[queen (chess)|queen]] nine. These values are a consequence of the difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 17</ref> The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing [[pawn structure]]. They are also more likely to be hemmed in.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 32\u201333</ref> A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 17. The bughouse playing program [http://sunsetter.sourceforge.net/ Sunsetter] uses the values pawn=100, bishop=195, knight=192, rook=200 and queen=390, while the engine [http://www.sjeng.org/indexold.html Sjeng] uses pawn=100, bishop=230, knight=210, rook=250 and queen=450. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Coordination ===\nCaptured pieces are passed on and thus what happens on one board influences what happens on the other board. It is therefore natural for team members to communicate during game play. A common request of an attacking player would be \"trades are good\", while players in trouble would ask their partner to hold trades with \"trades are bad\". Equally a player can request a piece e.g. \"knight wins a queen\" or ask to hold a piece e.g. \"rook mates me\".<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 243\u201344</ref>\n\nAnother common situation in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving, also called sitting or stalling. This can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at the request of the partner. Suppose a player is under heavy attack, and an additional pawn would mate him. When the partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move, sitting is the only strategy. It would of course be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well, waiting for a pawn to come. The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a \"sitzkrieg\" (literally \"sitting war\" in German, and a pun on \"[[blitzkrieg]]\"). The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move. This diagonal time advantage is more important than the difference on the clock between opponents on the same board.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 75\u201389</ref>\n\nApart from this active communication, a good bughouse player tries to coordinate silently by keeping an eye on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. This can mean as little as glancing at the other board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.<ref>See Chris Ferrante (2000) {{cite web|url=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/f/e/ferrantc/chess/bughouse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117233417/http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/f/e/ferrantc/chess/bughouse.html |archivedate=2007-01-17 }}, reproduced in von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 79\u201394</ref>\n\n=== Attack and defense ===\nAttacking the king can mean checking the opponent but also controlling vital squares around the king. It is an essential part of bughouse gameplay. From a player's perspective, attacking the king has important advantages as opposed to defending or attempting to win material:<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 109</ref>\n* Because of the possibility of dropping pieces, attacks in bughouse can quickly lead to checkmate.\n* The attacking player has the initiative, he is the one who controls the board, while the opponent is left to react. This has also important consequences for the other board.\n* It is easier to attack than to defend. A defending mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender needs to be more precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.\n* It is common to sacrifice material to build up, or sustain an attack. Characteristic of attacks is the so-called \"piece storm\", where a player drops piece after piece with check. Contact checks or knight checks, which force the king to move as opposed to dropping pieces, are especially important. They can be used to drive the king into the open, away from its defenders, while they prevent the opponent from putting new material on the board.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 20</ref>\n\nPartner communication is essential in a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner should be aware of which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 113</ref>\n\n=== Opening ===\nThere are significantly fewer bughouse openings than there are [[chess opening]]s. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available after the first few moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 68</ref>\n\n== Notation and sample game ==\n[[Image:Bughouse game animation.gif|frame|right|Example bughouse game]]\n\nThe [[algebraic chess notation]] for [[chess]] can be used to record moves in bughouse games.\nDifferent notations for piece drops are possible.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992) use an \"x\" (as used in captures) in front to indicate a piece drop, as in xNf1. Penn and Dizon (1998) use the \"I\" (for insert) in front as in INf1. Von Zimmerman (2006) uses the @-notation.</ref> The [[internet chess server]]s [[Free Internet Chess Server|FICS]] and [[Internet Chess Club]] use the at-sign [[@]], as in N@f1 (knight drop at f1), Q@e6+ (queen drop with check at e6) or P@h7 (pawn drop at h7).\n\nBecause of the fast pace at which the game is played, bughouse games are rarely recorded\nin games played over the board. With the arrival of [[Bughouse chess#Online|online chess]] it has become possible to systematically record games.<ref>Two large bughouse databases are [http://www.bughouse-db.org Jamesbaud's database] and [http://www.bughouse.be/database.html Lieven's database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030525/http://www.bughouse.be/database.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}.Accessed July 31, 2007.</ref> The format in which this is done is the bughouse portable game notation (BPGN), an extension of the [[Portable Game Notation]] for chess.<ref>[http://www.bughouse.be/BPGN_Standard.txt Specification of the BPGN format from bughouse.be].

Each team member faces one opponent of the other team. Partners sit next to each other and one player has black, while the other has white. Each player plays the opponent as in a standard [[rules of chess|chess]] game, with the exception of the rules specified below.<ref>Bughouse has many variations and there is no international standard. The rules below are in accordance with the [http://www.uschess.org/tournaments/2006/2006bughouse.pdf US chess federation], the rules as applied on the chess servers [[Free Internet Chess Server]] and [[Internet Chess Club]] and the [http://bughouse.info Berlin bughouse tournament]. In the case rules contradict, alternatives are listed. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Captured pieces ===\nA player capturing a [[chess piece|piece]] immediately passes that piece to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place one of these pieces on the board (as in [[shogi]] and [[crazyhouse]]), called ''dropping'' the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, [[pawn (chess)|pawns]] may not be dropped on the first or last {{chessgloss|rank}}. Dropped pawns may [[promotion (chess)|promote]], but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 15</ref> A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on the table in front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.\n\n=== Clock and completion of a move ===\nBughouse chess is usually played with [[chess clock]]s to prevent players from waiting indefinitely\nfor a piece. Clocks are placed on the outside so that each player can see both clocks. At the\nstart of the game, the players with the black pieces start the clocks simultaneously.\nBughouse is usually played using {{chessgloss|clock move}}, which allows touching of pieces. A move is completed only when the clock is pressed. {{chessgloss|touched piece rule|Touch move}} is practiced to a lesser extent.<ref>See for example the [http://pion.ch/Bug/ruleseng.html rules of the Geneva bughouse tournament]. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref> When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.\n\nBughouse can be played without a clock, but then there is usually a rule preventing a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond the time that it takes for their partner to make three moves.<ref name=cvv>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.chessvariants.org/multiplayer.dir/tandem.html\n |last1=Bodlaender\n |first1=Hans\n |authorlink1=Hans Bodlaender\n |last2=Scott\n |first2=Jay\n |last3=Junta\n |first3=Cristobal Joseevich\n |title=Bughouse and Tandem Chess\n |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]]\n |date=March 18, 2002\n |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}</ref>A team must have one checkmate to win. If they draw, it's over.\n\n=== End of the game ===\nThe match ends when either of the games on the two boards ends. A game is won when one player\ngets [[checkmate]]d, resigns, forfeits on time or when an illegal move\nis made in which the offending side is caught. The match can be drawn [[draw by agreement|by agreement]] or when two players run out of time or are checkmated simultaneously. Depending on (local) rules [[threefold repetition]] applies, in which case the reserve of pieces is not taken into account.<ref>For instance, the threefold repetition applies on [[Free Internet Chess Server|FICS]] but not on [[Internet Chess Club]].</ref>\n\nAlternatively, when one board finishes, play can continue on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still be dropped, but no new pieces are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.<ref name=\"cvv\" />\n\n=== Communication ===\nPartners are normally allowed to talk to each other during the game. They can for instance ask for a specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or ask their partner to stall. Shouts like \"Knight mates!\" or \"Don't let him have a Bishop!\" are common, and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.<ref>See Article nr. 12, [http://www.uschess.org/tournaments/2006/2006bughouse.pdf US Chess Federation bughouse rules]. Accessed August 27, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Two-player and six-player variations ==\nIt is possible to play the game with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one [[Game clock|clock]] by playing the boards in a specific order (White A, White B, Black B, Black A) and pressing the clock after each move. This variation is suitable for play [[correspondence chess|by mail]].<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 108</ref>\n\nBughouse can be played with three or more boards. The game is played in exactly the same way as normal bughouse with boards placed with alternating colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three-board bughouse chess, the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces.<ref name=mhtf>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 34\u201337</ref> The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.\n\n== Strategy ==\n\n=== Material ===\nIn chess, a minor material advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, there is no [[Chess endgame|endgame]] play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.<ref name=\"mhtf\" />\n\nA scoring system to evaluate material is to add up the [[Chess piece relative value|piece values]] of the material on the board. In chess, when a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] equals one unit, a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] or [[knight (chess)|knight]] is worth three, a [[rook (chess)|rook]] five and a [[queen (chess)|queen]] nine. These values are a consequence of the difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 17</ref> The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing [[pawn structure]]. They are also more likely to be hemmed in.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 32\u201333</ref> A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 17. The bughouse playing program [http://sunsetter.sourceforge.net/ Sunsetter] uses the values pawn=100, bishop=195, knight=192, rook=200 and queen=390, while the engine [http://www.sjeng.org/indexold.html Sjeng] uses pawn=100, bishop=230, knight=210, rook=250 and queen=450. Accessed July 29, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Coordination ===\nCaptured pieces are passed on and thus what happens on one board influences what happens on the other board. It is therefore natural for team members to communicate during game play. A common request of an attacking player would be \"trades are good\", while players in trouble would ask their partner to hold trades with \"trades are bad\". Equally a player can request a piece e.g. \"knight wins a queen\" or ask to hold a piece e.g. \"rook mates me\".<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 243\u201344</ref>\n\nAnother common situation in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving, also called sitting or stalling. This can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at the request of the partner. Suppose a player is under heavy attack, and an additional pawn would mate him. When the partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move, sitting is the only strategy. It would of course be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well, waiting for a pawn to come. The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a \"sitzkrieg\" (literally \"sitting war\" in German, and a pun on \"[[blitzkrieg]]\"). The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move. This diagonal time advantage is more important than the difference on the clock between opponents on the same board.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992), pp. 75\u201389</ref>\n\nApart from this active communication, a good bughouse player tries to coordinate silently by keeping an eye on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. This can mean as little as glancing at the other board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.<ref>See Chris Ferrante (2000) {{cite web|url=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/f/e/ferrantc/chess/bughouse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117233417/http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/f/e/ferrantc/chess/bughouse.html |archivedate=2007-01-17 }}, reproduced in von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 79\u201394</ref>\n\n=== Attack and defense ===\nAttacking the king can mean checking the opponent but also controlling vital squares around the king. It is an essential part of bughouse gameplay. From a player's perspective, attacking the king has important advantages as opposed to defending or attempting to win material:<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 109</ref>\n* Because of the possibility of dropping pieces, attacks in bughouse can quickly lead to checkmate.\n* The attacking player has the initiative, he is the one who controls the board, while the opponent is left to react. This has also important consequences for the other board.\n* It is easier to attack than to defend. A defending mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender needs to be more precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.\n* It is common to sacrifice material to build up, or sustain an attack. Characteristic of attacks is the so-called \"piece storm\", where a player drops piece after piece with check. Contact checks or knight checks, which force the king to move as opposed to dropping pieces, are especially important. They can be used to drive the king into the open, away from its defenders, while they prevent the opponent from putting new material on the board.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 20</ref>\n\nPartner communication is essential in a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner should be aware of which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 113</ref>\n\n=== Opening ===\nThere are significantly fewer bughouse openings than there are [[chess opening]]s. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available after the first few moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 68</ref>\n\n== Notation and sample game ==\n[[Image:Bughouse game animation.gif|frame|right|Example bughouse game]]\n\nThe [[algebraic chess notation]] for [[chess]] can be used to record moves in bughouse games.\nDifferent notations for piece drops are possible.<ref>Manson and Hoover (1992) use an \"x\" (as used in captures) in front to indicate a piece drop, as in xNf1. Penn and Dizon (1998) use the \"I\" (for insert) in front as in INf1. Von Zimmerman (2006) uses the @-notation.</ref> The [[internet chess server]]s [[Free Internet Chess Server|FICS]] and [[Internet Chess Club]] use the at-sign [[@]], as in N@f1 (knight drop at f1), Q@e6+ (queen drop with check at e6) or P@h7 (pawn drop at h7).\n\nBecause of the fast pace at which the game is played, bughouse games are rarely recorded\nin games played over the board. With the arrival of [[Bughouse chess#Online|online chess]] it has become possible to systematically record games.<ref>Two large bughouse databases are [http://www.bughouse-db.org Jamesbaud's database] and [http://www.bughouse.be/database.html Lieven's database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030525/http://www.bughouse.be/database.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}.Accessed July 31, 2007.</ref> The format in which this is done is the bughouse portable game notation (BPGN), an extension of the [[Portable Game Notation]] for chess.<ref>[http://www.bughouse.be/BPGN_Standard.txt Specification of the BPGN format from bughouse.be].

It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board.<ref>von Zimmerman (2006), p. 240</ref> The time aspect is altered due to existence of [[premove]] and [[Lag#Lag in online multiplayer gaming|lag]].

While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most do not consider it to have a positive effect, especially for novice chess players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uschess.org/scholastic/sc-guide2.html|title=A guide to scholastic chess|work=Uschess.org|publisher=United States Chess Federation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192828/http://www.uschess.org/scholastic/sc-guide2.html|archive-date=13 February 2008}}</ref> According to [[Susan Polgar]], \"If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK.

It also lacks endgame play due to pieces being recycled, thereby reducing the need for precise moves. In addition, the lack of control over your teammate's board introduces randomness that is not encountered in normal chess. Further, many claim that since there is no set order of moves between the two boards, normal calculation ability is diminished. It also shares criticisms with [[speed chess]] in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.<ref name=wsj/>\n\n[[Levon Aronian]] is among those who view bughouse as beneficial \"for players who know chess well already.&nbsp;...

He also worked as '''King Kong Brody''', '''The Masked Marauder''', and '''Red River Jack'''.  Over the years Brody became synonymous with the [[hardcore wrestling]] brawling style that often saw one or more of the participants bleeding by the time the match was over. In his prime he worked as a \"special attraction\" wrestler in North America, making select appearances for various promotions such as [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] (CSW), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWFF), and the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) among others. He worked regularly in Japan for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW).\n\nBehind the scenes Goodish was very protective of his \"in-ring\" image, hardly ever agreeing to lose matches and building a reputation of being volatile; he would on occasion intentionally hit or hurt opponents during a match contrary to the pre-determined nature of professional wrestling. His in-ring work and wrestling persona earned him an induction in the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|professional wrestling hall of fame]], [[St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame]], [[Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame]], [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].\n\nGoodish died in 1988 from stab wounds suffered backstage in a shower during a wrestling event in [[Puerto Rico]]. The killer was [[Jos\u00e9 Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez]], the wrestler known as Invader I. A jury acquitted Gonz\u00e1lez of murder, ruling that Gonz\u00e1lez killed Goodish in self-defence. Key witnesses to the killing did not give testimony at Gonz\u00e1lez's trial due to their summons only being received after the trial had concluded.<ref name=newsAU/>\n\nThis situation led to many US wrestlers not working in Puerto Rico for a long time afterward. The Brody murder remains one of the most controversial incidents in the history of professional wrestling.\n\n==Early life==\nGoodish was an All-State football and basketball player at [[Warren High School (Warren, Michigan)|Warren High School, Michigan]], and played football at [[West Texas A&M University]] (then known as West Texas State) and with the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n{{citation needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAfter attending West Texas A&M and working as a sportswriter Goodish was trained to wrestle by [[Fritz Von Erich]]. He first wrestled in Dallas - Fort Worth and later Louisiana. As Bruiser Brody and King Kong Brody, Goodish competed as a freelancer in several companies including the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] (CSW), [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] (SCW), [[Windy City Pro Wrestling|Windy City Wrestling]], [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC), [[Deep South Wrestling]] (DSW), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF), [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), and [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). In the States, he had numerous feuds with the likes of [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala the Ugandan Giant]], [[Abdullah the Butcher]], and [[\"Crusher\" Jerry Blackwell]]. In Japan, he was in a tag team with [[Stan Hansen]]. Brody had a reputation for refusing to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to other wrestlers. He also competed under the moniker of Red River Jack in Texas, during an angle against [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart's]] men and [[Skandor Akbar]]'s Army in World Class Championship Wrestling. Brody also competed as the Masked Marauder at one time in the AWA. In 1976, he went to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince J. McMahon's]] WWWF where he challenged WWWF Champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Brody also teamed with [[Big John Studd]]. It was also in the WWWF where he wrestled Invader 1 (Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez), for whom he refused to [[sell (professional wrestling)|sell]].\n\nIn 1985, he had a very short stint with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) in a feud with [[Antonio Inoki]] and many of their matches ended in no contests or disqualifications. In 1987, Brody began working primarily for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico after getting fired from New Japan. Brody continued his feud with Abdullah the Butcher, as well as engaging in a feud with [[Carlos Colon]]. He briefly returned to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] to win his last [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship]]. On April 15, 1988, the first attempt to form what became the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] was done when Brody faced off against [[NWA United National Championship|NWA United National]] and [[PWF Heavyweight Championship|PWF]] champion [[Genichiro Tenryu]]; the result was a double countout. Brody lost the title to [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] four days later. In WCCW in Texas he was actually a babyface, most often against Abdullah The Butcher. However against Abdullah in Montreal he was a heel managed by Floyd Creatchman. While there Tim \"Killer\" Brooks acted as his brother Buster Brody. Brody was in an ongoing feud with The Russian Brute who later went on to AWA fame with Manager Ox Baker. Due to his huge reputation in Japan promoter [[Giant Baba|Shohei Baba]] had the match taped and later aired on Japanese TV.\n\nIn Florida he beat [[B. Brian Blair]] for the Florida State championship. Brody had an infamous cage match with [[Lex Luger]] in Florida on January 21, 1987. In the middle of the match, Brody stopped \"[[Work (professional wrestling)|work]]ing\" and stood around. Luger and [[Bill Alfonso]], the referee of the match, were puzzled and attempted to speak to Brody who did not respond. Luger and Alfonso decided to forgo the planned finish of the match and Alfonso disqualified Luger in a spot where Luger continually punched Brody in a corner and did not back off. After the match, Luger recalls asking Brody if he did anything wrong to upset him, to which Brody responded \"no\", and Brody's reasons for not working were not very clear, stating that \"the match just wasn't working\". In [[Larry Matysik]]'s book, ''Wrestling at the Chase'', Matysik states that before the match Brody told him \"I'm not putting up with any of his bullshit\" and that Brody was upset that Luger would not sell for him. However, when watching the match, it is clear that Luger did sell for Brody. In a later shoot interview, Bill Alfonso said that there was a miscommunication issue on who would lead the match and there was no ill will ever between the two. Another scenario was that Brody was upset with the promoters over his paychecks (Brody had a contentious history with wrestling promoters for much of his career) and decided to embarrass the promotion by being uncooperative in the match. In 1987 he returned to the AWA where he fought Greg Gagne and Jerry Blackwell. Despite his reputation as being disagreeable with promoters he would aid any who needed a boost in ticket sales as he was guaranteed to bring in crowds. While working for WCCW in Texas he was the booker and produced their TV program.\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrior to his wrestling career, Goodish worked as a sportswriter in San Antonio, Texas.

Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.115)</ref> allegedly asked him to step into the shower area to discuss business. There was an argument between the two wrestlers and a scuffle ensued. Due to the design of the dressing room, there were no witnesses to the altercation. However, two screams were heard, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. [[Tony Atlas]] ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at Gonz\u00e1lez and saw him holding a knife.<ref name=atlasTMTS>Atlas, Tony. ''ATLAS Too Much ... Too Soon''. Crowbar Press.

When the paramedics arrived, Atlas helped carry Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance as, due to Brody's size, paramedics were unable to lift him. He later died from his stab wounds. Gonz\u00e1lez claimed self-defense and testified in his own defense. He was acquitted of murder in 1989. The prosecution witnesses living outside of Puerto Rico did not show up, claiming they had not received their summons until after the trial had ended.\n\nDutch Mantel and Tony Atlas, fellow wrestlers, have said that in the 1970s, when Brody and Gonz\u00e1lez had wrestled each other, Brody had wrestled very roughly and beat up Gonz\u00e1lez.

American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who earned his greatest fame under the [[ring name]] '''Bruiser Brody.''' He also worked as '''King Kong Brody''', '''The Masked Marauder''', and '''Red River Jack'''.  Over the years Brody became synonymous with the [[hardcore wrestling]] brawling style that often saw one or more of the participants bleeding by the time the match was over. In his prime he worked as a \"special attraction\" wrestler in North America, making select appearances for various promotions such as [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] (CSW), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWFF), and the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) among others. He worked regularly in Japan for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW).\n\nBehind the scenes Goodish was very protective of his \"in-ring\" image, hardly ever agreeing to lose matches and building a reputation of being volatile; he would on occasion intentionally hit or hurt opponents during a match contrary to the pre-determined nature of professional wrestling. His in-ring work and wrestling persona earned him an induction in the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|professional wrestling hall of fame]], [[St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame]], [[Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame]], [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].\n\nGoodish died in 1988 from stab wounds suffered backstage in a shower during a wrestling event in [[Puerto Rico]]. The killer was [[Jos\u00e9 Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez]], the wrestler known as Invader I. A jury acquitted Gonz\u00e1lez of murder, ruling that Gonz\u00e1lez killed Goodish in self-defence. Key witnesses to the killing did not give testimony at Gonz\u00e1lez's trial due to their summons only being received after the trial had concluded.<ref name=newsAU/>\n\nThis situation led to many US wrestlers not working in Puerto Rico for a long time afterward. The Brody murder remains one of the most controversial incidents in the history of professional wrestling.\n\n==Early life==\nGoodish was an All-State football and basketball player at [[Warren High School (Warren, Michigan)|Warren High School, Michigan]], and played football at [[West Texas A&M University]] (then known as West Texas State) and with the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n{{citation needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAfter attending West Texas A&M and working as a sportswriter Goodish was trained to wrestle by [[Fritz Von Erich]]. He first wrestled in Dallas - Fort Worth and later Louisiana. As Bruiser Brody and King Kong Brody, Goodish competed as a freelancer in several companies including the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] (CSW), [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] (SCW), [[Windy City Pro Wrestling|Windy City Wrestling]], [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC), [[Deep South Wrestling]] (DSW), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF), [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), and [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). In the States, he had numerous feuds with the likes of [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala the Ugandan Giant]], [[Abdullah the Butcher]], and [[\"Crusher\" Jerry Blackwell]]. In Japan, he was in a tag team with [[Stan Hansen]]. Brody had a reputation for refusing to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to other wrestlers. He also competed under the moniker of Red River Jack in Texas, during an angle against [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart's]] men and [[Skandor Akbar]]'s Army in World Class Championship Wrestling. Brody also competed as the Masked Marauder at one time in the AWA. In 1976, he went to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince J. McMahon's]] WWWF where he challenged WWWF Champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Brody also teamed with [[Big John Studd]]. It was also in the WWWF where he wrestled Invader 1 (Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez), for whom he refused to [[sell (professional wrestling)|sell]].\n\nIn 1985, he had a very short stint with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) in a feud with [[Antonio Inoki]] and many of their matches ended in no contests or disqualifications. In 1987, Brody began working primarily for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico after getting fired from New Japan. Brody continued his feud with Abdullah the Butcher, as well as engaging in a feud with [[Carlos Colon]]. He briefly returned to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] to win his last [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship]]. On April 15, 1988, the first attempt to form what became the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] was done when Brody faced off against [[NWA United National Championship|NWA United National]] and [[PWF Heavyweight Championship|PWF]] champion [[Genichiro Tenryu]]; the result was a double countout. Brody lost the title to [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] four days later. In WCCW in Texas he was actually a babyface, most often against Abdullah The Butcher. However against Abdullah in Montreal he was a heel managed by Floyd Creatchman. While there Tim \"Killer\" Brooks acted as his brother Buster Brody. Brody was in an ongoing feud with The Russian Brute who later went on to AWA fame with Manager Ox Baker. Due to his huge reputation in Japan promoter [[Giant Baba|Shohei Baba]] had the match taped and later aired on Japanese TV.\n\nIn Florida he beat [[B. Brian Blair]] for the Florida State championship. Brody had an infamous cage match with [[Lex Luger]] in Florida on January 21, 1987. In the middle of the match, Brody stopped \"[[Work (professional wrestling)|work]]ing\" and stood around. Luger and [[Bill Alfonso]], the referee of the match, were puzzled and attempted to speak to Brody who did not respond. Luger and Alfonso decided to forgo the planned finish of the match and Alfonso disqualified Luger in a spot where Luger continually punched Brody in a corner and did not back off. After the match, Luger recalls asking Brody if he did anything wrong to upset him, to which Brody responded \"no\", and Brody's reasons for not working were not very clear, stating that \"the match just wasn't working\". In [[Larry Matysik]]'s book, ''Wrestling at the Chase'', Matysik states that before the match Brody told him \"I'm not putting up with any of his bullshit\" and that Brody was upset that Luger would not sell for him. However, when watching the match, it is clear that Luger did sell for Brody. In a later shoot interview, Bill Alfonso said that there was a miscommunication issue on who would lead the match and there was no ill will ever between the two. Another scenario was that Brody was upset with the promoters over his paychecks (Brody had a contentious history with wrestling promoters for much of his career) and decided to embarrass the promotion by being uncooperative in the match. In 1987 he returned to the AWA where he fought Greg Gagne and Jerry Blackwell. Despite his reputation as being disagreeable with promoters he would aid any who needed a boost in ticket sales as he was guaranteed to bring in crowds. While working for WCCW in Texas he was the booker and produced their TV program.\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrior to his wrestling career, Goodish worked as a sportswriter in San Antonio, Texas. Goodish was married on June 4, 1968, to Nola Marie Neece;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/25456?c=search&first=Frank&last=Goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}</ref> the marriage ended in divorce on October 12, 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/31992?c=search&first=Frank&last=Goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}</ref> Goodish's second wife, New Zealander Barbara Smith, remained with him until his death in 1988. She has stated that while his wrestling persona was known for brutality and being uncontrollable, Brody was the complete opposite with his family. Brody and Smith lived in Texas. Together they had a son named Geoffrey Dean, born November 7, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/20902?c=search&first=geoffrey&last=goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nOn July 16, 1988, Brody was in the locker room before his scheduled match with [[Dan Spivey]] at [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Loubriel Stadium]] in [[Bayam\u00f3n]] (a city near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]), when [[Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Jos\u00e9 Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez]], a fellow wrestler and booker,<ref name=\"Foley, Mick p.115\">Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.115)</ref> allegedly asked him to step into the shower area to discuss business. There was an argument between the two wrestlers and a scuffle ensued. Due to the design of the dressing room, there were no witnesses to the altercation. However, two screams were heard, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. [[Tony Atlas]] ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at Gonz\u00e1lez and saw him holding a knife.<ref name=atlasTMTS>Atlas, Tony. ''ATLAS Too Much ... Too Soon''. Crowbar Press. (p.197-205) {{ISBN|978-0-9844090-2-0}}</ref>\n\nDue to the heavy traffic outdoors and large crowd in the stadium it took paramedics close to an hour to reach Brody. When the paramedics arrived, Atlas helped carry Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance as, due to Brody's size, paramedics were unable to lift him. He later died from his stab wounds. Gonz\u00e1lez claimed self-defense and testified in his own defense. He was acquitted of murder in 1989.

The team is controlled by the governing body of football and futsal in Bhutan, the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. [[Futsal]] used to be very much in an embryonic stage of development in Bhutan, with the team only having played eight competitive matches.  A national team was selected at very short notice for the [[2013 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games|fourth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games]] held in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]], in 2013. In their first game, they were soundly beaten 29-1 by [[Thailand national futsal team|Thailand]], despite scoring through Dawa Dhendup in the first minute. The team is currently ranked 150th and last in the world futsal rankings.\nBy establishing National League and investing in futsal infrastructure, conditions have significantly improved since then.\n\n==History==\nBhutan first entered an international futsal competition in 2005 when they took part in the [[2005 AFC Futsal Championship]] preliminary round.<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/futsal-as.html#05|title=Asian Futsal Championship Overview|last=De Bock|first=Christofhe|last2=Garin|first2=Erik|last3=Burkurt|first3=Sturmius|last4=Bobrowsky|first4=Josef|date=22 August 2008|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> Travelling to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in [[Vietnam]], they were drawn in Group C for the preliminary round along with [[Iran national futsal team|Iran]], [[Kuwait national futsal team|Kuwait]] and [[Lebanon national futsal team|Lebanon]].
