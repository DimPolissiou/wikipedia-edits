She chooses four of her sixth-grade students (Ethan, Noah, Nadia, and Julian), who form a group they call \"The Souls,\" to represent her class in the [[Academic Bowl]] competition. They defeat the other sixth-grade teams, then the seventh- and eighth-grade champions at Epiphany, and so on until they become [[New York state]] middle school champions. The children help their teacher live a happier life after her win. A child named Hamilton Knapp makes fun of her and makes life harder for her. Later The Souls stick out their arms and legs when Mrs. Olinski stands up for herself when Hamilton and his follower Jared Lord harass the class. They stick out their limbs to show that she can stand up for herself.\n\nBetween chapters that feature the progress of the competition, each of the four students narrates one chapter related both to the development of The Souls and to a question in the state championship [[final (competition)|final]]. Noah Gershom recounts learning [[calligraphy]] and being [[groomsman|best man]] for his grandfather's friend at his wedding in [[Century Village]] in [[Florida]]. Nadia Diamondstein describes working to conserve [[sea turtles]] and meeting Ethan, also at Century Village. Ethan Potter tells of meeting Julian, a new boy in town, and attending his tea parties, where the four Souls became friends. Julian Singh explains being new at school and tells of handling a chance for revenge against one of the bullies \u2014 remarkably grounded in the part played by Nadia's dog in the school musical.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Mrs. Eva Marie Olinski''' teaches at Epiphany Middle School. She feels that sixth-grade students have descended from \"Now what?\" to \"So what?\" during the years she has been away. Once shaken by her injury (car crash) and left paraplegic, she has suffered also from how students receive her. The four Souls respect her and help restore her confidence as a teacher, although they are not as the Academic Bowl team representing her class. For a long while she is not certain why she picked them, but with help from her friend Mr. Singh, she finally sees why, as explained in a long and confusing anecdote.\n*'''Noah Gershom''' has brown hair and wears glasses. His mother is a real estate agent and his father is a dentist who employs Nadia's mom. In Noah's story, he visits his grandparents who reside in a retirement home in Florida, where he unexpectedly has an opportunity to learn calligraphy and accidentally becomes the best man at the wedding of Izzy Diamondstein (Nadia's grandfather) and Margaret Draper (Ethan's grandmother) when Izzy's son sprains his ankle. Noah is the first to be chosen by Mrs. Olinski to become part of the quiz team because he is intelligent, observant, quick and articulate, always able to provide an answer, and is a willing leader. As Noah learns, he cannot always be the hero, and that a team only wins the Academic Bowl by working together.\n*'''Nadia Diamondstein''' is a beautiful plump girl with curly red hair, which notably forms a halo in the sunlight. She recently moved to New York from Florida with her mother, who works as a dental hygienist for Noah's father. Her father is an accountant in Florida, where grandfather Izzy Diamondstein recently married Ethan's grandmother Margaret Draper, formerly a principal and Mrs. Olinski's best friend.<ref group=lower-alpha>[[#sigwald|Review by Sigwald]]: Librarian John Sigwald remarks that \"the characters hardly note the numerous links between Epiphany, New York, and Century Village in Florida. I found a family tree (with a few birds on the branches) to be useful ...\". He provides a paraphrase of the tree.</ref> In the school play, Nadia's dog Ginger plays [[Little Orphan Annie#Characters|Little Orphan Annie's dog Sandy]]. She has a fondness for sea turtles.\n*'''Ethan Potter''' is a medium-sized boy with short, blond hair. He lives on a farm, and his family is one of the oldest in Epiphany. His grandmother, Margaret Draper, a teacher who retired to Florida, recently married Nadia's grandfather Izzy Diamondstein. Aware that he tends to disappoint his teachers, who compare and expect him to excel academically and athletically like his older brother, Lucas, or Luke, Ethan is a quiet and nervous individual until he becomes a part of the Souls. He loves theater, [[staging (theatre)|staging]] included, and has a secret passion for halos. His family's goal for him is to be a farmer while Lucas goes all around the world.\n*'''Julian Singh''' is an [[Indian people|Indian]] boy with black hair and a [[British accent]] that he acquired as a [[boarding school]] student in England. His mother was a [[chanteuse]], or singer, on a cruise ship who died young. His father is a cook and now an [[innkeeper]] at a farm in Epiphany that he has made into a [[bed and breakfast]] inn. There Julian has been \"facilitator\" of the four Souls, as host of 4:00&nbsp;pm tea every Saturday.<ref name=review/> Julian was teased and bullied by other students this year, as a new boy from another culture. That was a learning experience, especially for Ethan. Julian is the last chosen for the quiz team, the missing piece from Mrs. Olinski's perspective. Julian makes the very best of things. When a bully wrote something that was not school appropriate on his backpack, he wrote: I AM A pASSenger on spaceship earth. When kids try to trip him, he says \"excuse me\" or \"I beg your pardon\".\n*'''Hamilton Knapp''' is the antagonist of the story and is the character who wrote the non school appropriate message on Julian Singh's backpack. Hamilton Knapp was almost the 4th member of the academic bowl team. Hamilton Knapp tried to drug Ginger in the play [[Little Orphan Annie#Characters|Little Orphan Annie's dog Sandy]].\n\nKonigsburg tells Scholastic Teachers regarding all of her books that \"the characters begin their lives as people that I may know, but they end up their lives as characters!\"<ref name=transcript>[http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/collateral.jsp?id=1488_type=Contributor_typeId=3412 \"E.

A member of the council for three terms, he ran for mayor in 1999, losing to the CCC candidate Steven Plate.

A member of the council for three terms, he ran for mayor in 1999, losing to the CCC candidate Steven Plate. When Plate was selected as the CCC candidate again in 2003 (contradicting the committee's precedent of one term per mayor), Bergmanson ran again, and won, gaining the majority in all but one of the town's districts.
