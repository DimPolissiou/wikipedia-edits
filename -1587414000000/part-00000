Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today, the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers, each equipped with an access opening and cover, and separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.\n\nWastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. The excess liquid, now in a relatively clear condition, then drains from the outlet into the [[septic drain field]], also referred to as a leach field, drain field or seepage field, depending upon locality. A [[percolation test]] is required prior to installation to ensure the porosity of the soil is adequate to serve as a drain field.<ref>Section H2 Building Regulations</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gustafson|first1=David|last2=Machmeier|first2=Roger E.|title=How to run a percolation test|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/environment/housing-technology/moisture-management/how-to-run-a-percolation-test/index.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining impurities are trapped and eliminated in the [[soil]], with the excess water eliminated through [[percolation]] into the soil, through [[evaporation]], and by uptake through the [[root]] system of [[plant]]s and eventual [[transpiration]] or entering [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see [[weeping tile]]), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network.  The size of the drain field is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift [[pump]].  Certain septic tank designs include [[siphon]]s or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the drainage field.  These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or [[bioclogging]].\n\nAn [[Imhoff tank]] is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank.  This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the [[effluent]] from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.\n\nA properly designed and normally operating septic system is odor-free. Besides periodic inspection and emptying, a septic tank should last for decades with minimal maintenance, with concrete, fiberglass, or plastic tanks lasting about 50 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |title=Septic Tanks: The Real Poop |publisher=University of California Extension |accessdate=28 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303040517/http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |archive-date=3 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Emptying (desludging) ==\n[[File:Emptying of a tank full with sewage by vacuum truck (2921521126).jpg|thumb|A vacuum truck used to empty septic tanks in Germany]]\n{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}\nWaste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion must eventually be removed from the septic tank. Otherwise the septic tank fills up and wastewater containing undecomposed material discharges directly to the drainage field.  Not only is this detrimental for the environment but, if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or decrease the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.\n\nWhen a septic tank is emptied, the accumulated sludge ([[septage]], also known as [[fecal sludge]]<ref name=Arbogast2013>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/water/why-fecal-sludge-management-serious-business |title=Why Fecal Sludge Management is Serious Business |last=Arbogast |first=Brian |date=November 18, 2013 |work=The Water Blog, [[The World Bank]]}}</ref>) is pumped out of the tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. How often the septic tank must be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids, and the ambient temperature (because anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures), as well as usage, system characteristics and the requirements of the relevant authority. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the decision of an inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10\u201320 years between pumpings. An older system with an undersize tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly restarted when the tank is refilled.\n\nServices for desludging should not empty a septic tank completely but leave some settled solids in the septic tank to leave some of the microbial populations in place to continue the anaerobic degradation processes.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} An empty tank may be damaged by hydrostatic pressure causing the tank to partially \"float\" out of the ground, especially in flood situations or very wet ground conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Septic Systems - What to Do after the Flood |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/septic-systems-what-do-after-flood |website=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnother option is \"scheduled desludging\" of septic tanks which has been initiated in several Asian counties including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Meera|last2=Mehta|first2=Dinesh|last3=Yadav|first3=Upasana|date=2019|title=Citywide Inclusive Sanitation Through Scheduled Desludging Services: Emerging Experience From India|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00188/full|journal=Frontiers in Environmental Science|volume=7|pages=188|doi=10.3389/fenvs.2019.00188|issn=2296-665X|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> In this process, every property is covered along a defined route and the property occupiers are informed in advance about desludging that will take place.\n\n==Maintenance==\n\nThe maintenance of a septic system is often the responsibility of the resident or property owner. Some forms of abuse or neglect include the following:\n\n=== User's actions ===\n* Excessive disposal of cooking oils and grease can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.\n* Flushing non-biodegradable waste items down the toilet such as [[Cigarette#Cigarette butt|cigarette butts]], [[cotton swab|cotton buds/swabs]] or [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|menstrual hygiene products]] and [[condom]]s can cause a septic tank to clog and fill rapidly, so these materials should not be disposed of in that manner. The same applies when the toilet is connected to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] rather than a septic tank. \n* Using the toilet for disposal of food waste can cause a rapid overload of the system with solids and contribute to failure.<ref name=\"homeowner2\">{{cite web |title=What can make my system fail? |url=http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/homeowner_guide_long_customize.pdf |website=United States Environmental Protection Agency |publisher=EPA |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Certain chemicals may damage the components of a septic tank or kill the bacteria needed in the septic tank for the system to operate properly, such as [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, materials with high concentrations of [[bleach]] or [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] (lye),{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Mark|title=Septic Tanks \u2013 The Guide|url=https://septicleanse.com/septic-tanks/|publisher=Septicleanse|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n* Using [[Water softening|water softeners]] - the brine discharge from water softeners may harm the bacteria responsible for breaking down the wastewater. Usually, however, the brine is sufficiently diluted with other wastewater that it does not adversely affect the septic system.<ref>https://www.hockingcountyhealthdepartment.com/pdf/water-softener-fact-sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Other factors ===\n* Roots from trees and shrubbery protruding above the tank or drainfield may clog and/or rupture them. Trees that are directly within the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, added to which the trees themselves tend to expand extremely vigorously due to the ready supply of nutrients from the septic system.\n* Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impermeable surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.\n* Excessive water entering the system may overload it and cause it to fail.\n* Very high rainfall, rapid [[snowmelt]], and [[flood]]ing from rivers or the sea can all prevent a drain field from operating, and can cause flow to back up, interfering with the normal operation of the tank. High winter [[water table]]s can also result in [[groundwater]] flowing back into the septic tank.\n* Over time, [[biofilm]]s develop on the pipes of the drainage field, which can lead to blockage. Such a failure can be referred to as \"biomat failure\".\n\n=== Septic tank additives ===\n{{Further|Pit additives}}\nSeptic tank additives have been promoted by some manufacturers with the aim to improve the effluent quality from septic tanks, reduce sludge build-up and to reduce odors. These additives\u2014which are commonly based on \"[[effective microorganisms]]\"\u2014are usually costly in the longer term and fail to live up to expectations.<ref name=\":0\">Foxon, K., Still, D.

Since septic systems require large [[Septic drain field|drainfields]], they are unsuitable for densely built areas.\n\n=== Odor and gas emissions ===\nSome constituents of wastewater, especially [[sulfate]]s, under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to [[hydrogen sulfide]], a [[odor|pungent]] and [[toxic]] gas. [[Methane]] may also be released. [[Nitrate]]s and [[Nitro compound|organic nitrogen compounds]] can be reduced to [[ammonia]]. Because of the anaerobic conditions, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes take place, which may generate [[carbon dioxide]] and/or [[methane]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Nutrients in the effluent ===\nSeptic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing [[nitrogen]] compounds that have potential to cause [[algal blooms]] in waterways into which affected water from a septic system finds its way. This can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology,<ref name=\"Vcenter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |title=Residential nutrient reduction |accessdate=2010-12-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602060154/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2011 }}</ref> or by simply ensuring that the leach field is properly sited to prevent direct entry of effluent into bodies of water.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anaerobic with a low [[redox]] potential, which keeps [[phosphates]] in a soluble and, thus, mobilized form. Phosphates discharged from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms, which can also include blooms of potentially toxic [[cyanobacteria]].\n\nThe soil's capacity to retain phosphorus is usually large enough to handle the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when [[septic drain field]]s are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjacent to a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphates. Phosphates will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of [[eutrophication]] to surface waters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/eb1475/eb1475.html | author = Craig G.

Some small towns experience the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, due to the high cost of extended collection systems. To reduce residential development that might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limitations on the [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.\n\n=== Surface water pollution ===\nIn areas adjacent to water bodies with fish or [[shellfish]] intended for human consumption, improperly maintained and failing septic systems contribute to pollution levels that can force harvest restrictions and/or commercial or recreational harvest closures.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the [[United States]], the 2007 American Housing Survey indicated that about 20 percent of all households rely on septic tanks, <ref name=\"AHS2007\">{{cite web |title=American Housing Survey for the United States: 2007 |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/h150-07.pdf |website=American Housing Survey |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |accessdate=2018-08-08 |page=6}}</ref> and that the overwhelming majority of systems are located in [[rural]] (50%) and [[suburb]]an (47%) areas.<ref name=\"AHS2007\" |page=17,28,39/> [[Indianapolis]] is one example of a large city where many of the city's neighborhoods still rely on separate septic systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensenergygroup.com/STEP|title=Septic Tank Elimination Program|publisher=Citizens Energy Group|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> In Europe, septic systems are generally limited to rural areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Regulations==\n{{Over-coverage|section|region=the European Union|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== European Union ===\nIn the [[European Union]] the [[EN 12566]] standard provides the general requirements for packaged and site assembled treatment plants used for domestic wastewater treatment.\n\nPart 1 ([[EN 12566-1]]) is for septic tanks that are prefabricated or factory manufactured and made of [[polyethylene]], [[glass reinforced polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[UPVC|PVC-U]], [[steel]] or [[concrete]].

Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today, the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers, each equipped with an access opening and cover, and separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.\n\nWastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. The excess liquid, now in a relatively clear condition, then drains from the outlet into the [[septic drain field]], also referred to as a leach field, drain field or seepage field, depending upon locality. A [[percolation test]] is required prior to installation to ensure the porosity of the soil is adequate to serve as a drain field.<ref>Section H2 Building Regulations</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gustafson|first1=David|last2=Machmeier|first2=Roger E.|title=How to run a percolation test|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/environment/housing-technology/moisture-management/how-to-run-a-percolation-test/index.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining impurities are trapped and eliminated in the [[soil]], with the excess water eliminated through [[percolation]] into the soil, through [[evaporation]], and by uptake through the [[root]] system of [[plant]]s and eventual [[transpiration]] or entering [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see [[weeping tile]]), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network.  The size of the drain field is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift [[pump]].  Certain septic tank designs include [[siphon]]s or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the drainage field.  These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or [[bioclogging]].\n\nAn [[Imhoff tank]] is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank.  This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the [[effluent]] from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.\n\nA properly designed and normally operating septic system is odor-free. Besides periodic inspection and emptying, a septic tank should last for decades with minimal maintenance, with concrete, fiberglass, or plastic tanks lasting about 50 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |title=Septic Tanks: The Real Poop |publisher=University of California Extension |accessdate=28 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303040517/http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |archive-date=3 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Emptying (desludging) ==\n[[File:Emptying of a tank full with sewage by vacuum truck (2921521126).jpg|thumb|A vacuum truck used to empty septic tanks in Germany]]\n{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}\nWaste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion must eventually be removed from the septic tank. Otherwise the septic tank fills up and wastewater containing undecomposed material discharges directly to the drainage field.  Not only is this detrimental for the environment but, if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or decrease the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.\n\nWhen a septic tank is emptied, the accumulated sludge ([[septage]], also known as [[fecal sludge]]<ref name=Arbogast2013>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/water/why-fecal-sludge-management-serious-business |title=Why Fecal Sludge Management is Serious Business |last=Arbogast |first=Brian |date=November 18, 2013 |work=The Water Blog, [[The World Bank]]}}</ref>) is pumped out of the tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. How often the septic tank must be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids, and the ambient temperature (because anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures), as well as usage, system characteristics and the requirements of the relevant authority. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the decision of an inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10\u201320 years between pumpings. An older system with an undersize tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly restarted when the tank is refilled.\n\nServices for desludging should not empty a septic tank completely but leave some settled solids in the septic tank to leave some of the microbial populations in place to continue the anaerobic degradation processes.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} An empty tank may be damaged by hydrostatic pressure causing the tank to partially \"float\" out of the ground, especially in flood situations or very wet ground conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Septic Systems - What to Do after the Flood |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/septic-systems-what-do-after-flood |website=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnother option is \"scheduled desludging\" of septic tanks which has been initiated in several Asian counties including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Meera|last2=Mehta|first2=Dinesh|last3=Yadav|first3=Upasana|date=2019|title=Citywide Inclusive Sanitation Through Scheduled Desludging Services: Emerging Experience From India|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00188/full|journal=Frontiers in Environmental Science|volume=7|pages=188|doi=10.3389/fenvs.2019.00188|issn=2296-665X|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> In this process, every property is covered along a defined route and the property occupiers are informed in advance about desludging that will take place.\n\n==Maintenance==\n\nThe maintenance of a septic system is often the responsibility of the resident or property owner. Some forms of abuse or neglect include the following:\n\n=== User's actions ===\n* Excessive disposal of cooking oils and grease can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.\n* Flushing non-biodegradable waste items down the toilet such as [[Cigarette#Cigarette butt|cigarette butts]], [[cotton swab|cotton buds/swabs]] or [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|menstrual hygiene products]] and [[condom]]s can cause a septic tank to clog and fill rapidly, so these materials should not be disposed of in that manner. The same applies when the toilet is connected to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] rather than a septic tank. \n* Using the toilet for disposal of food waste can cause a rapid overload of the system with solids and contribute to failure.<ref name=\"homeowner2\">{{cite web |title=What can make my system fail? |url=http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/homeowner_guide_long_customize.pdf |website=United States Environmental Protection Agency |publisher=EPA |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Certain chemicals may damage the components of a septic tank or kill the bacteria needed in the septic tank for the system to operate properly, such as [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, materials with high concentrations of [[bleach]] or [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] (lye),{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Mark|title=Septic Tanks \u2013 The Guide|url=https://septicleanse.com/septic-tanks/|publisher=Septicleanse|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n* Using [[Water softening|water softeners]] - the brine discharge from water softeners may harm the bacteria responsible for breaking down the wastewater. Usually, however, the brine is sufficiently diluted with other wastewater that it does not adversely affect the septic system.<ref>https://www.hockingcountyhealthdepartment.com/pdf/water-softener-fact-sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Other factors ===\n* Roots from trees and shrubbery protruding above the tank or drainfield may clog and/or rupture them. Trees that are directly within the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, added to which the trees themselves tend to expand extremely vigorously due to the ready supply of nutrients from the septic system.\n* Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impermeable surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.\n* Excessive water entering the system may overload it and cause it to fail.\n* Very high rainfall, rapid [[snowmelt]], and [[flood]]ing from rivers or the sea can all prevent a drain field from operating, and can cause flow to back up, interfering with the normal operation of the tank. High winter [[water table]]s can also result in [[groundwater]] flowing back into the septic tank.\n* Over time, [[biofilm]]s develop on the pipes of the drainage field, which can lead to blockage. Such a failure can be referred to as \"biomat failure\".\n\n=== Septic tank additives ===\n{{Further|Pit additives}}\nSeptic tank additives have been promoted by some manufacturers with the aim to improve the effluent quality from septic tanks, reduce sludge build-up and to reduce odors. These additives\u2014which are commonly based on \"[[effective microorganisms]]\"\u2014are usually costly in the longer term and fail to live up to expectations.<ref name=\":0\">Foxon, K., Still, D.

Since septic systems require large [[Septic drain field|drainfields]], they are unsuitable for densely built areas.\n\n=== Odor and gas emissions ===\nSome constituents of wastewater, especially [[sulfate]]s, under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to [[hydrogen sulfide]], a [[odor|pungent]] and [[toxic]] gas. [[Methane]] may also be released. [[Nitrate]]s and [[Nitro compound|organic nitrogen compounds]] can be reduced to [[ammonia]]. Because of the anaerobic conditions, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes take place, which may generate [[carbon dioxide]] and/or [[methane]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Nutrients in the effluent ===\nSeptic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing [[nitrogen]] compounds that have potential to cause [[algal blooms]] in waterways into which affected water from a septic system finds its way. This can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology,<ref name=\"Vcenter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |title=Residential nutrient reduction |accessdate=2010-12-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602060154/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2011 }}</ref> or by simply ensuring that the leach field is properly sited to prevent direct entry of effluent into bodies of water.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anaerobic with a low [[redox]] potential, which keeps [[phosphates]] in a soluble and, thus, mobilized form. Phosphates discharged from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms, which can also include blooms of potentially toxic [[cyanobacteria]].\n\nThe soil's capacity to retain phosphorus is usually large enough to handle the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when [[septic drain field]]s are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjacent to a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphates. Phosphates will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of [[eutrophication]] to surface waters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/eb1475/eb1475.html | author = Craig G.

Some small towns experience the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, due to the high cost of extended collection systems. To reduce residential development that might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limitations on the [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.\n\n=== Surface water pollution ===\nIn areas adjacent to water bodies with fish or [[shellfish]] intended for human consumption, improperly maintained and failing septic systems contribute to pollution levels that can force harvest restrictions and/or commercial or recreational harvest closures.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the [[United States]], the 2007 American Housing Survey indicated that about 20 percent of all households rely on septic tanks, <ref name=\"AHS2007\">{{cite web |title=American Housing Survey for the United States: 2007 |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/h150-07.pdf |website=American Housing Survey |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |accessdate=2018-08-08 |page=6}}</ref> and that the overwhelming majority of systems are located in [[rural]] (50%) and [[suburb]]an (47%) areas.<ref name=\"AHS2007\" |page=17,28,39/> [[Indianapolis]] is one example of a large city where many of the city's neighborhoods still rely on separate septic systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensenergygroup.com/STEP|title=Septic Tank Elimination Program|publisher=Citizens Energy Group|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> In Europe, septic systems are generally limited to rural areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Regulations==\n{{Over-coverage|section|region=the European Union|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== European Union ===\nIn the [[European Union]] the [[EN 12566]] standard provides the general requirements for packaged and site assembled treatment plants used for domestic wastewater treatment.\n\nPart 1 ([[EN 12566-1]]) is for septic tanks that are prefabricated or factory manufactured and made of [[polyethylene]], [[glass reinforced polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[UPVC|PVC-U]], [[steel]] or [[concrete]]. Part 4 ([[EN 12566-4]]) regulates septic tanks that are assembled in situ from prefabricated kits, generally of concrete construction. Certified septic tanks of both types must pass a standardized hydraulic test to assess their ability to retain suspended solids within the system. Additionally, their structural adequacy in relevant ground conditions is assessed in terms of water-tightness, treatment efficiency, and structural behaviour.<ref>Santala, E.

Blasdel''' (His surname is sometimes listed as Blasedale) (January 2, 1843 &ndash; 1932) was a [[Union Army]] soldier during the [[American Civil War]]. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for gallantry during the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] on May 22, 1863.'''Thomas A. Blasdel'''  (1843\u20131932) was a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient and a soldier in the American Civil War. Blasdel went on to get promoted to Private, and from there to Corporal. Blasdel enlisted in the Union army at 19 years old in August, 1862 during the Civil War.\n\n== Early life  ==\n\nThomas A. Blasdel was born on January 2, 1843 in Dearborn County, Indiana, United States of America. His parents were named Ferris Enoch Blasdel and Clarissa Annis Blasdel and they too were both born in America. The Blasdel family was a big one, consisting of 10 children. Thomas was the second oldest of 9 children; 5 girls and 4 boys. His siblings were: Rhoda, Pamelia, Eleanor, George, Enoch, John, Clara, Raymond, and Rachel.\n\n== Career  ==\n\nFor most of his military career, Thomas Blasdel served as a Private in Company H, 83rd Indiana Infantry. The event that Thomas is most famous for is his actions during the Siege of Vicksburg. \n\nOn May 22, 1863, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.\n\nThomas Blasdel was 20 years old at the time and still relatively new to his military career. Private Blasdel, along with many other soldiers, volunteered to be a part of the storming party against the Confederates during the Siege of Vicksburg. Thomas and the other did this knowing that the odds of all of them, or even some of them, being alive afterwards were very slim and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \"forlorn hope\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. Even though the men knew how risky it was, double the amount of needed men volunteered and some were even turned away. In the end there were 150 men apart of the storming party. This meant that they had to, before the main attack by the Confederates, build a bridge across a moat and plant ladders all against the Confederate embankment. \n\nThis entire event  started in the morning, not very long after a naval bombardment by the opposing side. The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Even though there were multiple, powerful attacks by the Confederates, Private Blasdel, along with others, were able to hold off the opposing side. From the morning those 150 men kept away tons of Confederate soldiers. This went on until night, when both sides retreated since it was dark. Out of the 150 who bravely volunteered, around half of them were killed; which in reality could have been worse and was much better than what men predicted. 79 of the survivors (including Thomas A Blasdel) were awarded the Medal of Honor. This event happened just one year after Thomas Blasdel enlisted in the army.\n\nBlasdel was discharged in June 1865.<ref>[http://www.indianadigitalarchives.org/ViewRecord.aspx?RID=CB1FE990A284DCB9B18F2601A270E772 Indiana Digital Archives]</ref>\nOn August 11, 1894, 31 years after the fact at the age of 51, Blasdel received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siege of Vicksburg.\n\n== Later life  ==\n\nBlasdel married Elizabeth and had a child, Emert.
