Its council had religious authority and the power to pronounce punishments against offenders. Punishments could range from fines to expulsion and to conduct sacred wars. The Amphictyonic League also set the rules of battle so as to protect sanctuaries and impose sentences on those who molested sanctuaries. All members were obliged to pledge themselves by an oath as reported by [[Aeschines]].<ref>The Speeches of Aeschines, On the Embassy, https://archive.org/stream/speechesofaesch00aesc/speechesofaesch00aesc_djvu.txt  (p.245)</ref>\n\nBased on legend, the Great Amphictyonic League was founded somewhat after the [[Trojan War]], for the protection and administration of the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi, Greece|Delphi]] and [[Temple of Demeter Amphictyonis|temple of Demeter]] in [[Anthela (Thessaly)|Anthela]] (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03bb\u03b7), near [[Thermopylae]]. The [[founding myth]] claimed that it had been founded in the most distant past by an [[Eponym|eponymous founder]] [[Amphictyon]], brother of [[Hellen]], the common ancestor of all Hellenes. Representatives of the twelve members (called ''hieromnemones'') met in Thermopylae in spring and in Delphi in autumn.\n\nThe twelve founders enumerated by [[Aeschines]]<ref>Aeschines, ii (''On the embassy''). 115; see also [[Strabo]], ix.3.7, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x.8.2-5.</ref> were the [[Aenianes]] or [[Oetaeans]] (\u0391\u1f30\u03bd\u03b9\u1fb6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, \u039f\u1f30\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), the [[Boeotians]] (\u0392\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03af) of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the [[Dolopes]] (\u0394\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2), the [[Dorians]] (\u0394\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03c2) of [[Sparta]], the [[Ionians]] (\u1f3c\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) of [[Athens]], the [[Phthia]]n Achaeans (\u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03af), the [[Locrians]] (\u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af) [Opuntians (\u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) and Ozolians (\u1f48\u03b6\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03af)], the [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]ns (\u039c\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2), the [[Malians (Greek tribe)|Malians]] (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2), the [[Perrhaebians]] (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03af), the [[Phocians]] (\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2), the [[Pythia]]ns (\u03a0\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) of [[Delphi]], and the [[Thessalians]] (\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03af). The League doctrine required that no member would be entirely wiped out in war and no water supply of any member would be cut even in wartime. It did not prevent members from fighting about the dominance over the temples.\n\n===The first Amphictyony===\n\nThe oldest religious Amphictyonic League was known as ''Anthelian'', because it was centered on the cult of the [[chthonic]] goddess [[Demeter]] at Anthela. The twelve delegates were entitled ''Pylagorai'' (gate-assemblers), perhaps a reference to the local Gates of Hades, since Demeter was a chthonic goddess in her older local cults. The immediate dwellers-round were some small states and also Achaea-Phthiotis that probably paved the way for the entry of the body of the rest Boeotian tribes which were living around Thessaly (''perioikoi''). Boeotia and [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]] the remotest may have joined only during or after the \"[[First Sacred War]]\", which led to the defeat of the old priesthood and to a new control of the prosperity of the oracle at [[Delphi]].<ref>L. H . Jeffery (1976). ''Archaic Greece. The Greek city states c. 700-500 B.C.''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London & Tonbridge  pp. 72-73, 78. {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the war the Anthelan body was known thenceforth as the Delphic Amphictyony and became the official overseer and military defender of the Delphic cult. A strange and revealing anti-Thessalian feeling appeared and a wall was built across the narrow defile at Thermopylae to keep the Thessalians out.\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Shield of Heracles]] may reflect anti-Thessalian feeling after the First Sacred War: in this epic, a Thessalian hero interfering with the [[Phocis|Phocian]] [[sanctuary]] is killed by a Boeotian hero ([[Heracles]]), whose mortal father Amphitryon had for allies [[Locris|Locrians]] and Phocians. This was a pastiche made to be sung at a Boeotian festival at midsummer at the hottest time of the dogstar ''Sirios''.<ref>L.H.Jeferry (1976). ''The Archaic Greece. The Greek city states. 700-500 B.C.'', p.74</ref>\n\nThe name ''Hellenes'', may be related to the members of the league and may have been broadened to refer to all Greeks when the myth of their patriarch [[Hellen]] was invented. In Greek mythology [[Amphictyon]] was brother of Hellen, and [[Graecus]] was son of his sister [[Pandora]]. According to the [[Parian Chronicle]], the previously-named Graeces were renamed Hellenes.<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004008.html Entry No 6: Graeces-Hellenes]</ref>\n\n===Sacred Wars===\nOriginally a religious organization, the Amphictyonic League became politically important in the 6th century BCE, when larger city-states began to use it to apply pressure to the lesser ones.\n\nThe Oracle managed to become independent from the city of Krissa, to which the temple originally belonged. The people of Krissa then imposed a tax on those who were passing through their area to go to Delphi, causing strong complaints and reducing the resources of the Oracle. The Amphictyony, having exhausted all other means to peacefully resolve the crisis, declared the [[First Sacred War]] (or ''Cirrhean War'')<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZwNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA92 An Epitome of the Civil and Literary Chronology of Greece. By Henry Fynes Clinton, p. 92.]</ref> against Krissa that lasted a decade, from 596 to 585 BCE. The result was the destruction of Krissa and the dedication of this country to [[Apollo]], [[Leto]], [[Artemis]], and [[Athena]] Pronaia. After this, the [[Pythian Games]] were held every four years, under the direction of the Amphictyons.\n\nIn 449-448 the Phocians, wanting to become masters of the sanctuary, marched against Delphi, but the Spartans sent an army and restored things, thus causing the [[second Sacred War]]. After the Spartans\u2019 departure, the Athenians, led by [[Pericles]], gave back to the Phocians the rule of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games. In 421, after the [[Peace of Nicias]], Delphi became autonomous again. It is unlikely, however, that Phocis remained in control of Delphi after members of the Boeotian League defeated Athens at the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BCE)]].<ref>For a more detailed account of this conflict, see Donald Kagan (1969), The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, pp. 120-124, based largely on Thuc. 1.112-13.</ref>\n\nIn 356 the Phocians under Philomelos captured and [[Looting|sacked]] Delphi and another sacred war was declared against them. After a [[Third Sacred War|ten-year war]] the Phocians were expelled from the League in 346 and their two votes were given to [[Macedon]]ians who had helped to defeat them. [[Philip II of Macedonia]] used this power to further his expansionist policy in Greece. This ended up in the [[Fourth Sacred War]] which culminated in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BCE), marking the final domination of the Macedonians over Greece.\n\n===Decline===\nIn 279 the Delphic Amphictyony admitted as new members the [[Aetolians]], who had successfully defended the sanctuary as well as the rest of mainland Greece against the [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Gauls]]. At this instance the Phocians were also readmitted for having also participated at the defense of the region. In the 3rd century the [[Soteria (festival)]] was held in honour of the Greek victory against the Gauls.\nBy 191 the League had 17 members but only the most dominant one had the two votes, when others had only one. The league continued to exist under the [[Roman Empire]] but its authority was limited to the care of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman emperor [[Augustus]] incorporated the Aenianes, Malians, Magnetians and Pythians with the Thessalians. Since the Dolopes had meanwhile vanished,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} he gave their vote to the city of [[Nicopolis]].\n\nThe Amphictyonic League gradually declined and in the 2nd century CE it was replaced by the Panhellenion, established by the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]]. However, the see of the Amphictyonic League was in Athens, the emperor's favourite city. Thus, it seems that the Amphictyony finally faded away, although we have no specific date for its actual cessation.\n\n===Bolivar's emulation===\n\nThe [[Congress of Panama]], organized by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1826 with the goal of bringing together the new republics of [[Latin America]] in a permanent alliance, was often referred to as ''The Amphictyonic Congress'', in homage to the above.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calaurian Amphictyony]]\n* [[Delian Amphictyony]]\n* [[Panionium]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ancient Library on [https://web.archive.org/web/20100529233331/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0086.html Amphictyones] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060520081644/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0614.html Hieromnemones]\n*[http://www.attalus.org/docs/search.html#amphictyon Decrees of the Amphictyonic Council], in English translation at ''attalus.org''\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Delphic Amphictyony}}\n\n{{Sacred Wars}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek society]]\n[[Category:Delphic amphictyony| ]]\n[[Category:Archaic Greece]]\n[[Category:Iron Age Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek city-state federations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Pre-polis type of ancient Greek confederacy}}\n\nIn [[Archaic Greece]], an '''amphictyony''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}), a \"league of neighbors\", or '''Amphictyonic League''' was an ancient religious<ref>{{cite web|last=Definition|title=Amphictiony|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amphictiony|work=2014|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref> association of Greek tribes<ref>[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..am091400.a#FWNE.fw..am091400.a History.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423105512/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..am091400.a#FWNE.fw..am091400.a |date=April 23, 2009 }};[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565255/Amphictyonic_League.html Encarta].

Archaeology of the site suggested to Thomas Kelly that the sacred league was founded in the second quarter of the 7th century BCE, c. 680-650;<ref>Thomas Kelly, \"The Calaurian Amphictiony\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''70'''.2 (April 1966:113-121).</ref> before that date there were virtually no remains at the site, which could not have been used more than sporadically.<ref>Some [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] objects found at the site related to a few ancient burials without connection to Poseidon.

Its council had religious authority and the power to pronounce punishments against offenders. Punishments could range from fines to expulsion and to conduct sacred wars. The Amphictyonic League also set the rules of battle so as to protect sanctuaries and impose sentences on those who molested sanctuaries. All members were obliged to pledge themselves by an oath as reported by [[Aeschines]].<ref>The Speeches of Aeschines, On the Embassy, https://archive.org/stream/speechesofaesch00aesc/speechesofaesch00aesc_djvu.txt  (p.245)</ref>\n\nBased on legend, the Great Amphictyonic League was founded somewhat after the [[Trojan War]], for the protection and administration of the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi, Greece|Delphi]] and [[Temple of Demeter Amphictyonis|temple of Demeter]] in [[Anthela (Thessaly)|Anthela]] (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03bb\u03b7), near [[Thermopylae]]. The [[founding myth]] claimed that it had been founded in the most distant past by an [[Eponym|eponymous founder]] [[Amphictyon]], brother of [[Hellen]], the common ancestor of all Hellenes. Representatives of the twelve members (called ''hieromnemones'') met in Thermopylae in spring and in Delphi in autumn.\n\nThe twelve founders enumerated by [[Aeschines]]<ref>Aeschines, ii (''On the embassy''). 115; see also [[Strabo]], ix.3.7, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x.8.2-5.</ref> were the [[Aenianes]] or [[Oetaeans]] (\u0391\u1f30\u03bd\u03b9\u1fb6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, \u039f\u1f30\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), the [[Boeotians]] (\u0392\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03af) of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the [[Dolopes]] (\u0394\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2), the [[Dorians]] (\u0394\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03c2) of [[Sparta]], the [[Ionians]] (\u1f3c\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) of [[Athens]], the [[Phthia]]n Achaeans (\u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03af), the [[Locrians]] (\u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af) [Opuntians (\u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) and Ozolians (\u1f48\u03b6\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03af)], the [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]ns (\u039c\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2), the [[Malians (Greek tribe)|Malians]] (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2), the [[Perrhaebians]] (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03af), the [[Phocians]] (\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2), the [[Pythia]]ns (\u03a0\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) of [[Delphi]], and the [[Thessalians]] (\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03af). The League doctrine required that no member would be entirely wiped out in war and no water supply of any member would be cut even in wartime. It did not prevent members from fighting about the dominance over the temples.\n\n===The first Amphictyony===\n\nThe oldest religious Amphictyonic League was known as ''Anthelian'', because it was centered on the cult of the [[chthonic]] goddess [[Demeter]] at Anthela. The twelve delegates were entitled ''Pylagorai'' (gate-assemblers), perhaps a reference to the local Gates of Hades, since Demeter was a chthonic goddess in her older local cults. The immediate dwellers-round were some small states and also Achaea-Phthiotis that probably paved the way for the entry of the body of the rest Boeotian tribes which were living around Thessaly (''perioikoi''). Boeotia and [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]] the remotest may have joined only during or after the \"[[First Sacred War]]\", which led to the defeat of the old priesthood and to a new control of the prosperity of the oracle at [[Delphi]].<ref>L. H . Jeffery (1976). ''Archaic Greece. The Greek city states c. 700-500 B.C.''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London & Tonbridge  pp. 72-73, 78. {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the war the Anthelan body was known thenceforth as the Delphic Amphictyony and became the official overseer and military defender of the Delphic cult. A strange and revealing anti-Thessalian feeling appeared and a wall was built across the narrow defile at Thermopylae to keep the Thessalians out.\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Shield of Heracles]] may reflect anti-Thessalian feeling after the First Sacred War: in this epic, a Thessalian hero interfering with the [[Phocis|Phocian]] [[sanctuary]] is killed by a Boeotian hero ([[Heracles]]), whose mortal father Amphitryon had for allies [[Locris|Locrians]] and Phocians. This was a pastiche made to be sung at a Boeotian festival at midsummer at the hottest time of the dogstar ''Sirios''.<ref>L.H.Jeferry (1976). ''The Archaic Greece. The Greek city states. 700-500 B.C.'', p.74</ref>\n\nThe name ''Hellenes'', may be related to the members of the league and may have been broadened to refer to all Greeks when the myth of their patriarch [[Hellen]] was invented. In Greek mythology [[Amphictyon]] was brother of Hellen, and [[Graecus]] was son of his sister [[Pandora]]. According to the [[Parian Chronicle]], the previously-named Graeces were renamed Hellenes.<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004008.html Entry No 6: Graeces-Hellenes]</ref>\n\n===Sacred Wars===\nOriginally a religious organization, the Amphictyonic League became politically important in the 6th century BCE, when larger city-states began to use it to apply pressure to the lesser ones.\n\nThe Oracle managed to become independent from the city of Krissa, to which the temple originally belonged. The people of Krissa then imposed a tax on those who were passing through their area to go to Delphi, causing strong complaints and reducing the resources of the Oracle. The Amphictyony, having exhausted all other means to peacefully resolve the crisis, declared the [[First Sacred War]] (or ''Cirrhean War'')<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZwNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA92 An Epitome of the Civil and Literary Chronology of Greece. By Henry Fynes Clinton, p. 92.]</ref> against Krissa that lasted a decade, from 596 to 585 BCE. The result was the destruction of Krissa and the dedication of this country to [[Apollo]], [[Leto]], [[Artemis]], and [[Athena]] Pronaia. After this, the [[Pythian Games]] were held every four years, under the direction of the Amphictyons.\n\nIn 449-448 the Phocians, wanting to become masters of the sanctuary, marched against Delphi, but the Spartans sent an army and restored things, thus causing the [[second Sacred War]]. After the Spartans\u2019 departure, the Athenians, led by [[Pericles]], gave back to the Phocians the rule of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games. In 421, after the [[Peace of Nicias]], Delphi became autonomous again. It is unlikely, however, that Phocis remained in control of Delphi after members of the Boeotian League defeated Athens at the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BCE)]].<ref>For a more detailed account of this conflict, see Donald Kagan (1969), The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, pp. 120-124, based largely on Thuc. 1.112-13.</ref>\n\nIn 356 the Phocians under Philomelos captured and [[Looting|sacked]] Delphi and another sacred war was declared against them. After a [[Third Sacred War|ten-year war]] the Phocians were expelled from the League in 346 and their two votes were given to [[Macedon]]ians who had helped to defeat them. [[Philip II of Macedonia]] used this power to further his expansionist policy in Greece. This ended up in the [[Fourth Sacred War]] which culminated in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BCE), marking the final domination of the Macedonians over Greece.\n\n===Decline===\nIn 279 the Delphic Amphictyony admitted as new members the [[Aetolians]], who had successfully defended the sanctuary as well as the rest of mainland Greece against the [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Gauls]]. At this instance the Phocians were also readmitted for having also participated at the defense of the region. In the 3rd century the [[Soteria (festival)]] was held in honour of the Greek victory against the Gauls.\nBy 191 the League had 17 members but only the most dominant one had the two votes, when others had only one. The league continued to exist under the [[Roman Empire]] but its authority was limited to the care of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman emperor [[Augustus]] incorporated the Aenianes, Malians, Magnetians and Pythians with the Thessalians. Since the Dolopes had meanwhile vanished,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} he gave their vote to the city of [[Nicopolis]].\n\nThe Amphictyonic League gradually declined and in the 2nd century CE it was replaced by the Panhellenion, established by the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]]. However, the see of the Amphictyonic League was in Athens, the emperor's favourite city. Thus, it seems that the Amphictyony finally faded away, although we have no specific date for its actual cessation.\n\n===Bolivar's emulation===\n\nThe [[Congress of Panama]], organized by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1826 with the goal of bringing together the new republics of [[Latin America]] in a permanent alliance, was often referred to as ''The Amphictyonic Congress'', in homage to the above.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calaurian Amphictyony]]\n* [[Delian Amphictyony]]\n* [[Panionium]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ancient Library on [https://web.archive.org/web/20100529233331/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0086.html Amphictyones] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060520081644/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0614.html Hieromnemones]\n*[http://www.attalus.org/docs/search.html#amphictyon Decrees of the Amphictyonic Council], in English translation at ''attalus.org''\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category inline|Delphic Amphictyony}}\n\n{{Sacred Wars}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek society]]\n[[Category:Delphic amphictyony| ]]\n[[Category:Archaic Greece]]\n[[Category:Iron Age Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek city-state federations]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typos for \"Encyclopedia\", replaced: Enyclopaedia \u2192 Encyclopaedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica \u2192 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,typo(s) fixed: 680-650 \u2192 680\u2013650", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphictyonic_League"}

He wrote the novels ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' and ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', and also published [[Sermons of Laurence Sterne|many sermons]], wrote memoirs, and was involved in local politics. Sterne died in London after years of fighting [[tuberculosis]].\n\nSterne grew up in a military family and spent his youth traveling from place to place, never remaining in any location for over a year. Sterne's wealthy uncle provided the funds for Sterne to attend [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] as Sterne's father was ordered to Jamaica where he would die of malaria a few years later. Sterne attended Jesus College on a [[sizar|sizarship]] where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. While he serving a vicarship at [[Sutton-on-the-Forest]] in Yorkshire, he married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741. \n\nSterne's ''[[A Political Romance]]'', an ecclesiastical satire, received harsh criticism by the church and was burnt. Having discovered a talent for writing, Sterne published the first few volumes of his best-known novel, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen''. Sterne struggled with tuberculosis and traveled to France to find relief from his illness. His travels in France were documented in ''A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'', which was published a few weeks before his death. Published posthumously was ''Journal to Eliza'', a collection of his letters to [[Eliza Draper]], a woman for whom Sterne had romantic feelings. Sterne died in 1768 and was buried in the churchyard of [[St George's, Hanover Square]]. It has been alleged that Sterne's body was stolen after burial and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. After being recognized, he was reinterred. His alleged skull was found after the churchyard was redeveloped and was transferred to [[Coxwold]] churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Laurence Sterne by Joseph Nollekens, 1766, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|Laurence Sterne by [[Joseph Nollekens]], 1766, National Portrait Gallery, London]]\nSterne was born in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]] on 24 November 1713.{{sfn|Keymer|2009|p=xii}} His father, Roger Sterne, was an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in a British regiment recently returned from [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]], which was disbanded on the day of Sterne's birth.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=20-21}} Within six months the family had returned to [[Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=21}} His great-grandfather [[Richard Sterne (archbishop)|Richard Sterne]] had been the Master of the [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] as well as the Archbishop of York.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=22\u201323}} Roger Stern was the youngest son of Richard Sterne's youngest son and consequently, Roger Sterne inherited little of Richard Sterne's wealth.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=22\u201323}} Roger Sterne left his family and enlisted in the army at the age of 25; he enlisted uncommissioned, which was unusual for someone from a family of high social position. Despite being promoted to an officer, he was of the lowest commission and lacked financial resources.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=23\u201324}} Roger Sterne married Agnes Hobert, the widow of a military captain.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=24}}\n\nThe first decade of Laurence Sterne's life was spent moving from place to place as his father was reassigned throughout Ireland.  During this period Sterne never lived in one place for more than a year.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=21\u201322}} In 1724, Roger took Sterne to his wealthy brother, Richard, so that Laurence could attend [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=33}}; Laurence never saw his father again as Roger was ordered to [[Jamaica]] where he died of malaria in 1731.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=29\u201330}} Laurence was admitted to a [[sizar]]ship at Jesus College, in July 1733 at the age of 20.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=36\u201337}} He graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in January 1737 and returned in the summer of 1740 to be awarded his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n===Early career===\nSterne was ordained as a [[deacon]] on 6 March 1737<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurence Sterne's holy orders |url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/laurence-sternes-holy-orders |website=British Library |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref> and as a priest on 20 August 1738.{{sfn|Sichel|1971|p=27}} His religion is said to have been the \"centrist Anglicanism of his time\", known as \"[[latitudinarian]]ism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26412|title=Laurence Sterne|website=www.oxforddnb.com|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> A few days after his ordination as a priest, Sterne was awarded the vicarship living of [[Sutton-on-the-Forest]] in Yorkshire.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=48\u201349}} Sterne married Elizabeth Lumley on 30 March 1741, despite both being ill with [[Tuberculosis|consumption]].{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=58\u201360}} In 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring [[Benefice|living]] of [[Stillington, North Yorkshire|Stillington]] by Rev. Richard [[Levett]], Prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living. Subsequently Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton.{{sfn|Cross|1909|p=54}} He was also a [[prebendary]] of [[York Minster]].{{sfn|Cross|1909|p=37}} Sterne's life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Jaques Sterne, the [[Archdeacon]] of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] and [[Precentor]] of York Minster. Sterne's uncle was an ardent [[British Whig Party|Whig]]{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=45\u201347}}, and urged Sterne to begin a career of [[political journalism]] which resulted in some scandal for Sterne and, eventually, a terminal falling-out between the two men.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=64\u201370, 168\u2013174}}\n\nJaques Sterne was a powerful clergyman but a mean-tempered man and a rabid politician.{{sfn|Venn|Venn|1927|p=159}} In 1741\u201342 Laurence Sterne wrote political articles supporting the administration of [[Sir Robert Walpole]] for a newspaper founded by his uncle but soon withdrew from politics in disgust. His uncle became his arch-enemy, thwarting his advancement whenever possible. Despite the friction with his uncle, Laurence's Whig sympathies remained with him throughout his life.{{sfn|Keymer|2009|p=16}} Laurence lived in Sutton for twenty years, during which time he kept up an intimacy which had begun at Cambridge with [[John Hall-Stevenson]], a witty and accomplished ''[[bon vivant]]'', owner of [[Skelton Hall]] in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2001|pp=41\u201342}}; {{harvnb|Vapereau|1876|p=1915}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:The south entrance to Shandy Hall showing the gates.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shandy Hall]], Sterne's home in [[Coxwold]], North Yorkshire]]\n\nIn 1759, to support his dean in a church squabble, Sterne wrote ''[[A Political Romance]]'' (later called ''The History of a Good Warm Watch-Coat''), a Swiftian satire of dignitaries of the spiritual courts. At the demands of embarrassed churchmen, the book was burnt.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=190\u2013196}} Thus, Sterne lost his chances for clerical advancement but discovered his real talents; until the completion of this first work, \"he hardly knew that he could write at all, much less with humour so as to make his reader laugh\".{{sfn|Howes|1971|p=60}}\n\nHaving discovered his talent, at the age of 46, he turned over his parishes to a curate, and dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. It was while living in the countryside, having failed in his attempts to supplement his income as a farmer and struggling with tuberculosis, that Sterne began work on his best-known novel, ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever.<ref>\"Cross (1908), chap. 8, The Publication of Tristram Shandy: Volumes I and II, p.197</ref> He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759.<ref name=\"Cross178\">Cross (1908), chap. 8, ''The Publication of Tristram Shandy: Volumes I and II'', p.178</ref> Due to his poor financial position, Sterne was forced to borrow money for the printing of his novel, suggesting that Sterne was confident in the prospective commercial success of his work and that the local critical reception of the novel was favorable enough to justify the loan.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=213}}\n\nThe publication of ''Tristram Shandy'' made Sterne famous in London and on the continent.

Sterne was lucky to attach himself to a diplomatic party bound for [[Turin]], as England and France were still adversaries in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Sterne was gratified by his reception in France, where reports of the genius of ''Tristram Shandy'' had made him a celebrity. Aspects of this trip to France were incorporated into Sterne's second novel, ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]''.<ref name=\"encyclo\">{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=1985 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |location=Chicago |pages=256\u2013257 |isbn=0852294239}}</ref>\n\n===Eliza===\nEarly in 1767, Sterne met [[Eliza Draper]], the wife of an official of the [[East India Company]], then staying on her own in London.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=360}} He was quickly captivated by Eliza\u2019s charm, vivacity, and intelligence, and she did little to discourage the attentions of such a celebrated man.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2001|p=361}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sterne |first1=Laurence |title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of the Journal to Eliza and Various letters |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/60563/60563-h/60563-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> They met frequently, exchanged miniature portraits, and Sterne\u2019s admiration seems to have turned into an obsession which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress, Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting, and he died from consumption a year later without seeing her again. At the beginning of 1768, Sterne brought out his ''Sentimental Journey'' which contains some extravagant references to her, and the relationship, though platonic, aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his ''[[Journal to Eliza]]'' part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. After Sterne\u2019s death, Eliza allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title ''Letters from Yorick to Eliza'' and succeeded in suppressing her letters to him, though some blatant forgeries were produced, probably by [[William Combe]], in a volume entitled ''Eliza's Letters to Yorick''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Sclater |first=William Lutley |title= Sterne's Eliza; some account of her life in India: with her letters written between 1757 and 1774 |publisher= W.

A year later a group of [[Freemason]]s erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the [[churchyard]] of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination.

He wrote the novels ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' and ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', and also published [[Sermons of Laurence Sterne|many sermons]], wrote memoirs, and was involved in local politics. Sterne died in London after years of fighting [[tuberculosis]].\n\nSterne grew up in a military family and spent his youth traveling from place to place, never remaining in any location for over a year. Sterne's wealthy uncle provided the funds for Sterne to attend [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] as Sterne's father was ordered to Jamaica where he would die of malaria a few years later. Sterne attended Jesus College on a [[sizar|sizarship]] where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. While he serving a vicarship at [[Sutton-on-the-Forest]] in Yorkshire, he married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741. \n\nSterne's ''[[A Political Romance]]'', an ecclesiastical satire, received harsh criticism by the church and was burnt. Having discovered a talent for writing, Sterne published the first few volumes of his best-known novel, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen''. Sterne struggled with tuberculosis and traveled to France to find relief from his illness. His travels in France were documented in ''A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'', which was published a few weeks before his death. Published posthumously was ''Journal to Eliza'', a collection of his letters to [[Eliza Draper]], a woman for whom Sterne had romantic feelings. Sterne died in 1768 and was buried in the churchyard of [[St George's, Hanover Square]]. It has been alleged that Sterne's body was stolen after burial and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. After being recognized, he was reinterred. His alleged skull was found after the churchyard was redeveloped and was transferred to [[Coxwold]] churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Laurence Sterne by Joseph Nollekens, 1766, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|Laurence Sterne by [[Joseph Nollekens]], 1766, National Portrait Gallery, London]]\nSterne was born in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]] on 24 November 1713.{{sfn|Keymer|2009|p=xii}} His father, Roger Sterne, was an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in a British regiment recently returned from [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]], which was disbanded on the day of Sterne's birth.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=20-21}} Within six months the family had returned to [[Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=21}} His great-grandfather [[Richard Sterne (archbishop)|Richard Sterne]] had been the Master of the [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] as well as the Archbishop of York.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=22\u201323}} Roger Stern was the youngest son of Richard Sterne's youngest son and consequently, Roger Sterne inherited little of Richard Sterne's wealth.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=22\u201323}} Roger Sterne left his family and enlisted in the army at the age of 25; he enlisted uncommissioned which was unusual for someone from a family of high social position. Despite being promoted to an officer, he was of the lowest commission and lacked financial resources.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=23\u201324}} Roger Sterne married Agnes Hobert, the widow of a military captain.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=24}}\n\nThe first decade of Sterne's life was spent moving from place to place as his father was reassigned throughout Ireland.  During this period Sterne never lived in one place for more than a year.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=21\u201322}} In 1724, his father took Sterne to Roger's wealthy brother, Richard, so that Sterne could attend [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=33}}; Sterne never saw his father again as Roger was ordered to [[Jamaica]] where he died of malaria in 1731.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=29\u201330}} Sterne was admitted to a [[sizar]]ship at Jesus College, in July 1733 at the age of 20.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=36\u201337}} Sterne graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in January 1737. He returned in the summer of 1740 to be awarded his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n===Early career===\nSterne was ordained as a [[deacon]] on 6 March 1737<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurence Sterne's holy orders |url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/laurence-sternes-holy-orders |website=British Library |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref> and as a priest on 20 August 1738.{{sfn|Sichel|1971|p=27}} His religion is said to have been the \"centrist Anglicanism of his time\", known as \"[[latitudinarian]]ism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26412|title=Laurence Sterne|website=www.oxforddnb.com|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> A few days after his ordination as a priest, Sterne was awarded the vicarship living of [[Sutton-on-the-Forest]] in Yorkshire.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=48\u201349}} Sterne married Elizabeth Lumley on 30 March 1741, despite both being ill with [[Tuberculosis|consumption]].{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=58\u201360}} In 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring living of [[Stillington, North Yorkshire|Stillington]] by Rev. Richard [[Levett]], Prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living. Subsequently Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton.{{sfn|Cross|1909|p=54}} He was also a [[prebendary]] of [[York Minster]].{{sfn|Cross|1909|p=37}} Sterne's life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Dr Jaques Sterne, the [[Archdeacon]] of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] and [[Precentor]] of York Minster. Sterne's uncle was an ardent [[British Whig Party|Whig]]{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=45\u201347}}, and urged Sterne to begin a career of [[political journalism]] which resulted in some scandal for Sterne and, eventually, a terminal falling-out between the two men.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=64\u201370, 168\u2013174}}\n\nJaques Sterne was a powerful clergyman but a mean-tempered man and a rabid politician.{{sfn|Venn|Venn|1927|p=159}} In 1741\u201342 Sterne wrote political articles supporting the administration of [[Sir Robert Walpole]] for a newspaper founded by his uncle but soon withdrew from politics in disgust. His uncle became his arch-enemy, thwarting his advancement whenever possible. Despite the friction with his uncle, Laurence's Whig sympathies remained with him throughout his life.{{sfn|Keymer|2009|p=16}} Sterne lived in Sutton for twenty years, during which time he kept up an intimacy which had begun at Cambridge with [[John Hall-Stevenson]], a witty and accomplished ''[[bon vivant]]'', owner of [[Skelton Hall]] in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2001|pp=41\u201342}}; {{harvnb|Vapereau|1876|p=1915}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:The south entrance to Shandy Hall showing the gates.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shandy Hall]], Sterne's home in [[Coxwold]], North Yorkshire]]\n\nIn 1759, to support his dean in a church squabble, Sterne wrote ''[[A Political Romance]]'' (later called ''The History of a Good Warm Watch-Coat''), a Swiftian satire of dignitaries of the spiritual courts. At the demands of embarrassed churchmen, the book was burnt.{{sfn|Ross|2001|pp=190\u2013196}} Thus, Sterne lost his chances for clerical advancement but discovered his real talents; until the completion of this first work, \"he hardly knew that he could write at all, much less with humour so as to make his reader laugh\".{{sfn|Howes|1971|p=60}}\n\nHaving discovered his talent, at the age of 46, he turned over his parishes to a curate, and dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. It was while living in the countryside, having failed in his attempts to supplement his income as a farmer and struggling with tuberculosis, that Sterne began work on his best-known novel, ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever.<ref>\"Cross (1908), chap. 8, The Publication of Tristram Shandy: Volumes I and II, p.197</ref> He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759.<ref name=\"Cross178\">Cross (1908), chap. 8, ''The Publication of Tristram Shandy: Volumes I and II'', p.178</ref> Due to his poor financial position, Sterne was forced to borrow money for the printing of his novel, suggesting that Sterne was confident in the prospective commercial success of his work and that the local critical reception of the novel was favorable enough to justify the loan.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=213}}\n\nThe publication of ''Tristram Shandy'' made Sterne famous in London and on the continent. He was delighted by the attention, famously saying \"I wrote not [to] be ''fed'' but to be ''famous.\"''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fanning|first=Christopher|date=|title=Sterne and print culture|url=|journal=The Cambridge Companion to Laurence Sterne|volume=|pages=125\u2013141}}</ref> He spent part of each year in London, being f\u00eated as new volumes appeared. Even after the publication of volumes three and four of ''Tristram Shandy'', his love of attention (especially as related to financial success) remained undiminished. In one letter, he wrote \"One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies\u2014the best is, they abuse it and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Letters of Laurence Sterne: Part One, 1739\u20131764|last=|first=|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2009|isbn=978-0813032368|location=|pages=129\u2013130}}</ref> Indeed, [[Baron Fauconberg]] rewarded Sterne by appointing him as the perpetual [[curate]] of [[Coxwold]], North Yorkshire in March 1760.{{sfn|Howes|1971|p=55}}\n\nIn 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, the composer and former slave [[Ignatius Sancho]] wrote to Sterne<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/Carey_BJECS_2003.pdf |title=The extraordinary Negro': Ignatius Sancho, Joseph Jekyll, and the Problem of Biography |author=Carey, Brycchan |journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies |date=March 2003 |volume=26 |number=1 |pages=1\u201313 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2003.tb00257.x}}</ref> encouraging him to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters |chapter=Director's Forward |author=Phillips, Caryl |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London |date=December 1996 |page=12}}</ref> In July 1766 Sterne received Sancho's letter shortly after he had finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in ''Tristram Shandy'', wherein Tom described the oppression of a black servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon which he had visited.<ref name=\"Norton\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/noa/pdf/27636_Rest_U12_Sancho.pdf |title=Ignatius Sancho and Laurence Sterne |publisher=Norton}}</ref> Sterne's widely publicised response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.<ref name=\"Norton\" />\n\n===Foreign travel===\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|France in the Seven Years' War}}\n[[File:Laurence Sterne by Louis Carrogis Carmontelle.jpg|thumb|upright|Sterne painted in [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] by French artist [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle]], ca. 1762]]\nSterne continued to struggle with his illness, and departed England for France in 1762 in an effort to find a climate that would alleviate his suffering. Sterne was lucky to attach himself to a diplomatic party bound for [[Turin]], as England and France were still adversaries in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Sterne was gratified by his reception in France, where reports of the genius of ''Tristram Shandy'' had made him a celebrity. Aspects of this trip to France were incorporated into Sterne's second novel, ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]''.<ref name=\"encyclo\">{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=1985 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |location=Chicago |pages=256\u2013257 |isbn=0852294239}}</ref>\n\n===Eliza===\nEarly in 1767, Sterne met [[Eliza Draper]], the wife of an official of the [[East India Company]], then staying on her own in London.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=360}} He was quickly captivated by Eliza\u2019s charm, vivacity, and intelligence, and she did little to discourage the attentions of such a celebrated man.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2001|p=361}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sterne |first1=Laurence |title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of the Journal to Eliza and Various letters |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/60563/60563-h/60563-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> They met frequently, exchanged miniature portraits, and Sterne\u2019s admiration seems to have turned into an obsession which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress, Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting, and he died from consumption a year later without seeing her again. At the beginning of 1768, Sterne brought out his ''Sentimental Journey'' which contains some extravagant references to her, and the relationship, though platonic, aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his ''[[Journal to Eliza]]'' part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. After Sterne\u2019s death, Eliza allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title ''Letters from Yorick to Eliza'' and succeeded in suppressing her letters to him, though some blatant forgeries were produced, probably by [[William Combe]], in a volume entitled ''Eliza's Letters to Yorick''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Sclater |first=William Lutley |title= Sterne's Eliza; some account of her life in India: with her letters written between 1757 and 1774 |publisher= W.

A year later a group of [[Freemason]]s erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the [[churchyard]] of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination. One was identified to be of a size that matched a bust of Sterne made by Nollekens.<ref>{{cite news | title=Is this the skull of Sterne? | newspaper=[[The Times]] | pages= | date=5 June 1969 | url= }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loftis|Kellar|Ulevich|2018|pp=220, 227}}</ref>\n\nThe skull was held up to be his, albeit with \"a certain area of doubt\".{{sfn|Loftis|Kellar|Ulevich|2018|p=220}} Along with nearby skeletal bones, these remains were transferred to [[Coxwold]] [[churchyard]] in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Carole |title=Laurence Sterne |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2009/03/11/laurence_sterne_profile_feature.shtml |accessdate=4 March 2020 |work=BBC |date=March 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laurence Sterne and the Laurence Sterne Trust |url=https://www.laurencesternetrust.org.uk/the-laurence-sterne-trust.php |website=The Laurence Sterne Trust |publisher=Laurence Sterne Trust |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>''Alas, Poor Yorick'', Letters, The Times, 16 June 1969, Kenneth Monkman, Laurence Sterne Trust. \"If we have reburied the wrong one, nobody, I feel beyond reasonable doubt, would enjoy the situation more than Sterne\"</ref> The story of the reinterment of Sterne's skull in Coxwold is alluded to in [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s novel ''To the Hermitage''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suciu |first1=Andreia Irina |title=The Sense of History in Malcolm Bradbury's Work |journal=Economy Transdisciplinarity Cognition |date=2009 |issue=2 |pages=152\u2013160 |id={{ProQuest|757935757}} }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of ''Tristram Shandy'', part of the collection of the Laurence Sterne Trust at [[Shandy Hall]]]]\nThe works of Laurence Sterne are few in comparison to other eighteenth-century authors of comparable stature.{{sfn|New|1972|p=1083}} Sterne's early works were letters; he had two sermons published (in 1747 and 1750), and tried his hand at satire.{{sfn|Washington|2017|p=333}} He was involved in, and wrote about, local politics in 1742.{{sfn|Washington|2017|p=333}} His major publication prior to ''Tristram Shandy'' was the satire ''[[A Political Romance]]'' (1759), aimed at conflicts of interest within [[York Minster]].{{sfn|Washington|2017|p=333}} A posthumously published piece on the art of preaching, ''[[A Fragment in the Manner of Rabelais]]'', appears to have been written in 1759.{{sfn|New|1972|pp=1083-1091}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]] was by far Sterne's favourite author, and in his correspondence he made clear that he considered himself as Rabelais' successor in humour writing, distancing himself from [[Jonathan Swift]].<ref>Brown, Huntington (1967) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NRZpJATd44C Rabelais in English literature]'' pp.190\u20131</ref><ref>Cross (1908), chap. 8, ''The Publication of Tristram Shandy: Volumes I and II'', p.179</ref> Sterne's novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' sold widely in England and throughout Europe.{{sfn|Cash|1975|p=296}} Translations of the work began to appear in all the major European languages almost upon its publication, and Sterne influenced European writers as diverse as [[Denis Diderot]]{{sfn|Cash|1975|p=139}} and the [[Romanticism|German Romanticists]].{{sfn|Large|2017|p=294}} His work had also noticeable influence over Brazilian author [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of the digressive technique in the novel ''[[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas]]''.{{sfn|Barbosa|1992|p=28}} \n\nEnglish writer and literary critic [[Samuel Johnson]]'s verdict in 1776 was that \"Nothing odd will do long.

Since the 1950s, following the lead of DW Jefferson, there are those who argue that, whatever its legacy of influence may be, ''Tristram Shandy'' in its original context actually represents a resurgence of a much older, [[Renaissance]] tradition of \"Learned Wit\"\u2014owing a debt to such influences as the [[Scriblerus Club|Scriblerian]] approach.<ref>{{harvnb|Jefferson|1951}}; {{harvnb|Keymer|2002|pp=4-11}}</ref> ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' has many stylistic parallels with ''Tristram Shandy'', and indeed, the narrator is one of the minor characters from the earlier novel.{{sfn|Vivi\u00e8s|1994|pp=246-247}} Although the story is more straightforward, ''A Sentimental Journey'' is interpreted by critics as part of the same artistic project to which ''Tristram Shandy'' belongs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Line |first1=Anne |title=Two Englishmen in France: A Comparison of Laurence Sterne's Book 7 of \"Tristram Shandy\" and \"A Sentimental Journey\" |url=https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/25302 |website=University of Oslo Research Archive |publisher=University of Oslo |accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> Two volumes of Sterne's ''Sermons'' were published during his lifetime; more copies of his ''Sermons'' were sold in his lifetime than copies of ''Tristram Shandy''.{{sfn|Ross|2001|p=245}} The sermons, however, are conventional in substance.{{sfn|Pfister|2001|p=26}} Several volumes of letters were published after his death, as was ''[[Journal to Eliza]]''.{{sfn|Keymer|2009|p=xv}} These collections of letters, more sentimental than humourous, tell of Sterne's relationship with Eliza Draper.{{sfn|Pfister|2001|p=15}}\n\n==Publications==\n*1743 \"The Unknown World: Verses Occasioned by Hearing a Pass-Bell\"\n*1747 \"The Case of Elijah and the Widow of Zerephath\"\n*1750 \"The Abuses of Conscience\" \n*1759 ''A Political Romance''\n*1759 ''Tristram Shandy'' vol. 1 and 2\n*1760 ''The Sermons of Mr Yorick'' vol. 1 and 2\n*1761 ''Tristram Shandy'' vol. 3\u20136\n*1765 ''Tristram Shandy'' vol. 7 and 8\n*1766 ''The Sermons of Mr Yorick'' vol. 3 and 4\n*1767 ''Tristram Shandy'' vol. 9\n*1768 ''A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy''\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Irish writers]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Barbosa |first1=Maria Jos\u00e9 Somerlate |title=Sterne and Machado: Parodic and Intertextual Play in \"Tristram Shandy\" and \"Memorias\" |journal=The Comparatist |date=May 1992 |volume=16 |pages=24\u201348 |ref=harv|jstor=44366842 |doi=10.1353/com.1992.0014 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Arthur H. |title=Laurence Sterne: The Early & Middle Years |date=1975 |publisher=Methuen & Co |location=London |isbn=041682210X |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/laurencesterneea0000cash }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Wilbur L. |title=The Life and Times of Laurence Sterne |date=1909 |publisher=The Macmillan Company |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/lifetimesoflaure00cros |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifetimesoflaure00cros/page/53 53] |quote=Laurence Sterne Stillington Rev.

Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details various versions of Deadpool depicted in works including Marvel Comics Ultimate universe and What if issues.\n\n==Age of Apocalypse==\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Deadpool was redubbed '''Dead Man Wade''' and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's [[Pale Riders]], having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program. Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3, May 1995.</ref> Later, Dead Man Wade was revealed to be resurrected like many of the other Alpha mutants.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #3.</ref>\n\n==Captain America: Who Won't Wield the Shield==\nThe [[World War II]]-era version of Deadpool is introduced in the one-shot parody issue ''[[Captain America]]: Who Won't Wield the Shield''. Frederick \"Wheezy\" Wilson, the nephew of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], is a soldier who is experimented on by the Nazis to become 'V<!--intentionally misspelled in this series, do not correct to \"Weapon\"-->eapon X'.

He joins, claiming Wolverine only wants him as the \"token human\". This version of Deadpool is killed by [[Agent Zero]]'s Anti-Healing Factor corrosive acid. This version of Deadpool speaks in white text boxes.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Present''.</ref>\n\n==Marvel 2099==\nIn the potential future of [[Marvel 2099]], Deadpool is Warda Wilson, the daughter of Wade and Shiklah. She collaborates with a gang inspired by Hydra Agent Bob and is wanted by the police. She has taken an older Wade prisoner and forces him to watch political debates while chained up, angered that he's ruined her life and hopes she can use him to find her mother. Wade reveals he and Shiklah had a falling out after the death of Ellie, which led to a battle between the two former lovers in Hell.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #6.</ref> The new Deadpool is also being pursued by a woman who wears a costume that looks like Wade's \"Zenpool\" identity from Axis. The mysterious woman rescues Wade and gives him access to her bike to a hologram Preston. She then battles Warda and is revealed to be an alive Ellie, who plans to reclaim the Deadpool name.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #12.</ref> Wade and Preston break into the old hideout of the Uncanny Avengers for Wade to gear up. Warda and Ellie continue fighting until Warda reveals she will unleash a demonic monster unless Ellie does not get Wade to confess where Shiklah is. After Wade and Preston reunite with Ellie, Wade tells Ellie to search for Shiklah's casket at Doc Samson's grave while he and Preston then go to the Little Italy of 2099 to seek the help of one of the few heroes alive in this time period: Iron Fist.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #19.</ref>\n\nThe heroes and Danny's Iron Fists confront Warda in Madison Star Garden, where the Iron Fists fend off the giant monster while Wade tries to prevent his daughters from fighting by promising to tell Warda where Shiklah is. Despite his plea, Warda murders Ellie with liquid napalm and takes Wade to the sewer to interrogate him, where Wade reveals that Ellie's mutant ability is to regenerate all at once into her teenage body, allowing her to survive Warda's attack. After Wade, Preston, and Ellie defeat Warda, Wade tells her that he and Shiklah had an on-and-off-again relationship, but were always on the path for war which eventually resulted in her death, as on Earth, those who refuse to co-exist cease to exist (with Wade bringing up the Skrulls to support his point). He implants Preston into Warda's head so she can aid Warda in clearing her conscious and becoming a better person and tells his daughters that they can both be Deadpool. He later tells Ellie that he now plans to travel the world and rid the planet of his old enemies and that Shiklah's resting place is in a shrunken glass coffin located on top of his heart.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #25.</ref>\n\n==Marvel 2997==\nIn [[Messiah War]] Deadpool is locked in a freezer for eight hundred years. When he escapes he is captured by the armed forces of the few surviving humans left. He helps Cable to get [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] back from [[Stryfe]] who is later revealed to be inside this version of Deadpool's head. After seemingly defeating Stryfe, this version of Deadpool is quickly ripped in half and appears to die shortly after, his last words being a joke on \"severance\" pay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/995/995458p1.html |title=IGN: Cable #15 review |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=August 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Marvel Zombies==\nIn the first ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' limited series, a zombie version of Deadpool is seen fighting the [[Silver Surfer]].

Depicted as an anti-mutant extremist, he is a [[cyborg]] and leader of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] who hunt mutants for sport on a reality TV show. Beneath the mask, Deadpool appears to be a skull with an exposed brain, his skin formed by a transparent shell.

When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting [[Jheri curl]]s in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine, the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier.

Cuban Internet is characterized by a low number of connections, limited bandwidth, censorship and high cost. The Internet in Cuba stagnated since its introduction in 1996 due to several factors:\n* a lack of funding due to the devastation of Cuba\u2019s economy after the fall of the Soviet Union\n* the U.S. embargo which delayed construction infrastructure and made equipment expensive and difficult to obtain\n* tight government restrictions which identified the Internet as a tool for subversion of the Cuban Revolution<ref name=\":04\"/>\nStarting in 2007 this situation began to improve \u2014 Internet remains illegal in private homes but government-owned internet cafes offer Internet access. 118 cybercafes operate in Cuba.

All material intended for publication on the Internet must be approved by the National Registry of Serial Publications in advance. One report found that many foreign news outlet websites are not blocked in Cuba, but the slow connections and outdated technology in Cuba makes it impossible for citizens to load these websites. Rather than having complex filtering systems, the government relies on the high cost of getting online and the telecommunications infrastructure that is slow to restrict Internet access.

Since June 4, 2013 Cubans can sign up with [[ETECSA]], the state telecom company, for public Internet access at 118 centers across the country. The government approved wifi hotspots which were opened in 2015 give largely unfettered internet access and access to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter; however, opposition sites are blocked.

Some get online through embassies and coffee shops, or purchase accounts through the black market. The black market consists of professional or former government officials who have been cleared to have Internet access who sell or rent their usernames and passwords to citizens who want to have access.

In Havana, the Catholic Church publishes magazines such as ''Palabra Nueva'' and ''Espacio Laical'' monthly. In the diocese of Pinar del R\u00edo, ''Vitral'' is published bimonthly. These magazines and bulletins include religious instruction and news from the church.  The bulletin with the highest circulation is ''Vida cristiana'', published weekly in Havana; it reaches the majority of Catholics in the country. Today, the Church seeks to expand to different forms of media such as television and radio which it currently has no access.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\n=== Censorship ===\nCubans cannot read books, magazines or newspapers unless they have been approved/published by the government.

Of the six national AM/FM radio networks, the top three are [[Radio Progreso]], [[Radio Reloj]], and [[Radio Rebelde]], in that order. Two other national radio networks that also provide news and entertainment are Radio Musical Nacional (CMBF) and Radio Enciclopedia. Another station, [[Radio Ta\u00edno]], promotes [[tourism]]. The Cuban government also operates [[Radio Havana]], the official Cuban international short-wave radio service.

A series of small radio stations  in favor of the new government, organized an \"Independent Front of Free Broadcasters\" (Spanish: ''Frente Independiente de Emisoras Libres''). These radio stations were recognized as official by the new government. The government would develop a Bureau of Broadcasting under the political leadership of the PCC. Radio stations in the country were completely put under state control on May 24, 1962 under the management of the newly established Cuban Broadcasting Institute. Under the new broadcasting system, all media were to meet a set of values established by the government to strengthen the political process in the country, some names of radio stations were changed, and the coverage of radio services were extended to reach the whole country.

The popularity of radio led to the development and launch of television stations. The first years of television in Cuba were marked by a climate of competitiveness between two Cuban businessmen backed by US companies, Gaspar Pumarejo and Goar Mestre. Mestre started construction of ''Radio Center'', inspired by the Radio City in New York, while Pumarejo tried to develop a television studio in his own home.<ref name=\":12\"/> Pumarejo's channel (Uni\u00f3n Radio Televisi\u00f3n) was the first TV channel to start broadcasts in the island; it began broadcasting on 24 October 1950 with an address by President Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s from the Presidential Palace. Mestre began broadcasts on Channel 6 (CMQ) on December 18 of that year. [[Telenovela]]s, news, cooking shows, and comedy groups were shown.

Cuban Internet is characterized by a low number of connections, limited bandwidth, censorship and high cost. The Internet in Cuba stagnated since its introduction in 1996 due to several factors:\n* a lack of funding due to the devastation of Cuba\u2019s economy after the fall of the Soviet Union\n* the U.S. embargo which delayed construction infrastructure and made equipment expensive and difficult to obtain\n* tight government restrictions which identified the Internet as a tool for subversion of the Cuban Revolution<ref name=\":04\"/>\nStarting in 2007 this situation began to improve \u2014 Internet remains illegal in private homes but government-owned internet cafes offer Internet access. 118 cybercafes operate in Cuba.  In 2015, the government opened the first public wifi hotspots in 35 public locations and reduced prices and increased speeds for Internet access in cybercafes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://arabia.reporters-sans-frontieres.org/article.php3?id_article=10611 |title=Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res - Internet - Cuba |date=2011-07-27 |work=archive.is |access-date=2017-04-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110727014516/http://arabia.reporters-sans-frontieres.org/article.php3?id_article=10611 |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship ===\n{{See also|Internet censorship in Cuba}}The Cuban internet is among the most tightly regulated in the world. All content is subject to review by the [[Department of Revolutionary Orientation]].  At Internet cafes Cuban citizens have to give their name and address. All material intended for publication on the Internet must be approved by the National Registry of Serial Publications in advance. One report found that many foreign news outlet websites are not blocked in Cuba, but the slow connections and outdated technology in Cuba makes it impossible for citizens to load these websites. Rather than having complex filtering systems, the government relies on the high cost of getting online and the telecommunications infrastructure that is slow to restrict Internet access. Reports have shown that the Cuban government uses Avila Link software to monitor citizens use of the Internet. The government has obtained citizens usernames and passwords in order to closely monitor emails.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://12mars.rsf.org/2014-en/2014/03/11/cuba-long-live-freedom-but-not-for-the-internet/|title=Cuba: Long live freedom (but not for the Internet)!|date=2014-03-11|work=Enemies of the Internet|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDissidents accuse the government of not providing affordable home internet access for political reasons.

In 2007, it became possible for members of the public to legally buy a computer. Since June 4, 2013 Cubans can sign up with [[ETECSA]], the state telecom company, for public Internet access at 118 centers across the country. The government approved wifi hotspots which were opened in 2015 give largely unfettered internet access and access to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter; however, opposition sites are blocked. The cost of the new access at $4.50 an hour is still high in a country where state salaries average $20 a month. As of 2016, only 5% of Cubans enjoy web access at home.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Circumventing censorship and controversies ====\nCitizens have developed numerous techniques to circumvent the government's control of the Internet. Some get online through embassies and coffee shops, or purchase accounts through the black market. The black market consists of professional or former government officials who have been cleared to have Internet access who sell or rent their usernames and passwords to citizens who want to have access. Bloggers and dissidents also use USB keys to get their work published by giving their pieces to people who have an easier time getting online, who then upload their items from the USB.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThese USB sticks are known as \"El Paquete Semanal\" or weekly package noting their frequency of distribution across the Island.<ref>Humphreys, Laura-Zo\u00eb. \"Utopia in a Package?
