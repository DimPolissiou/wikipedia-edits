The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the [[Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.\n\nDivision among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Libya After Qaddafi: Lessons and Implications for the Future|last=Chivvis|first=Christopher S.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda;<ref name=\"John, Ronald Bruce 2014 p. 201\">{{cite book |last=St John |first=Ronald Bruce |date=4 June 2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Libya |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=201}}</ref> voting to declare [[sharia law]] and establishing a special committee to \"review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law\";<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/04/us-libya-law-idUSBRE9B30M220131204 |title=Libyan assembly votes to follow Islamic law |publisher=Reuters|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=26 August 2014 |last1=Bosalum |first1=Feras |last2=Markey |first2=Patrick}}</ref> imposing [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation]] and compulsory [[hijab]] at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014<ref>{{cite news|title=Libya congress extends its mandate until end-2014|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/libya-congress-extends-its-mandate-until-end-2014|agency=AFP|date=23 December 2013|access-date=3 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613134140/http://www.mei.edu/content/libya-congress-extends-its-mandate-until-end-2014|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named '''Operation Dignity''' ({{lang-ar |\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629}}; 'Amaliyat al-Karamah).<ref name=\"Magharebia Shahat\" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354 |title=Profile: Libyan ex-General Khalifa Haftar |date=16 October 2014 |first=Mohamed |last=Madi|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Political fragmentation of the GNC ===\nThe 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered \"fair and free\" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution.

The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the [[Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.\n\nDivision among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Libya After Qaddafi: Lessons and Implications for the Future|last=Chivvis|first=Christopher S.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda;<ref name=\"John, Ronald Bruce 2014 p. 201\">{{cite book |last=St John |first=Ronald Bruce |date=4 June 2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Libya |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=201}}</ref> voting to declare [[sharia law]] and establishing a special committee to \"review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law\";<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/04/us-libya-law-idUSBRE9B30M220131204 |title=Libyan assembly votes to follow Islamic law |publisher=Reuters|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=26 August 2014 |last1=Bosalum |first1=Feras |last2=Markey |first2=Patrick}}</ref> imposing [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation]] and compulsory [[hijab]] at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014<ref>{{cite news|title=Libya congress extends its mandate until end-2014|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/libya-congress-extends-its-mandate-until-end-2014|agency=AFP|date=23 December 2013|access-date=3 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613134140/http://www.mei.edu/content/libya-congress-extends-its-mandate-until-end-2014|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named '''Operation Dignity''' ({{lang-ar |\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629}}; 'Amaliyat al-Karamah).<ref name=\"Magharebia Shahat\" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354 |title=Profile: Libyan ex-General Khalifa Haftar |date=16 October 2014 |first=Mohamed |last=Madi|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Political fragmentation of the GNC ===\nThe 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered \"fair and free\" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution.

Written and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], it stars [[Moritz Bleibtreu]], [[Martina Gedeck]], and [[Johanna Wokalek]]. The film is based on the 1985 German best selling non-fiction book of the same name by [[Stefan Aust]]. It retells the story of the early years of the [[West Germany|West German]] [[far-left]] [[terrorist organisation]] the ''[[Rote Armee Fraktion]]'' (Red Army Fraction, or Red Army Faction, a.k.a. RAF) from 1967 to 1977.\n\nThe film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn 2 June 1967, the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] visits [[West Berlin]] and attends a performance at the [[Deutsche Oper]]. Angered at his policies in governing Iran, members of the [[German student movement]] protest his appearance. The West Berlin police and the Shah's security team attack the protesters, and unarmed protester [[Benno Ohnesorg]] is fatally shot by Officer [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]].\n\nOhnesorg's death outrages West Germany, including [[left wing]] journalist [[Ulrike Meinhof]], who claims in a televised debate that the democratically elected government of West Germany is a [[Fascist]] [[police state]]. Inspired by Meinhof's rhetoric, charismatic radicals [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] mastermind the {{ill|Frankfurt department store firebombing|de|Kaufhaus-Brandstiftungen am 2. April 1968}} of 1968. While covering their trial, Ulrike Meinhof finds herself deeply moved by their commitment to [[armed struggle]] against what they see as a [[Neo-Nazi]] Government. She secures a jailhouse interview with Ensslin and the two strike up a close friendship.  Soon after, Meinhof leaves her husband for Peter Homann.\n\nMeanwhile, Ensslin and Baader have been released pending an appeal and attract various young people, including [[Astrid Proll]] and [[Peter-Jurgen Boock]]. After spending some time abroad, Baader, Ensslin and Proll return to West Germany and begin living with Meinhof. Increasingly bored with her middle class life, Meinhof longs to take more [[direct action|violent action]]. Even though Ensslin tells her that sacrifices must be made for the revolution, Meinhof does not wish to leave her children. But then, Baader is arrested. Using her connections, Meinhof is able to arrange for him to be interviewed off prison grounds, where Ensslin and the others rescue him. While the plan called for Meinhof to look like an innocent journalist caught in a prison break, she flees with Baader and Ensslin, thereby incriminating herself in the attempted murders of an unarmed civilian and two policemen.\n\nAfter leaving Meinhof's two children in [[Sicily]], the group receives training in a [[Fatah]] camp in [[Jordan]], where the egotistical and promiscuous Germans enrage their Muslim hosts. Homann leaves the group after overhearing Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin asking Fatah to kill him. Having also learned that Meinhof wishes to send her two children to a training camp for suicide bombers, Homann informs Meinhof's former colleague [[Stefan Aust]], who returns the children to their father.\n\nReturning to Germany and styling themselves the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), Baader and his followers launch a campaign of bank robberies. In response, [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] chief Horst Herold orders all local police to be put at Federal command for one day. During that day, RAF member [[Petra Schelm]] drives through a roadblock and is chased by two cops. When cornered, she refuses to go quietly, initiates a gunfight, and is fatally shot by the policemen's return fire. Regarding this as murder, Baader and Ensslin overrule Meinhof's objections and begin systematically bombing police stations and [[United States Military]] bases. As grisly footage of the maimed and the dead appears onscreen, Meinhof's press statements rationalizing the bombings are heard in [[voiceover]].\n\nAs the violence escalates, Herold orders the BKA to pioneer [[criminal profiling]] and members of the RAF begin to be arrested. Baader and [[Holger Meins]] are caught after a shoot-out with police. Ensslin and Meinhof are captured soon after. In separate prisons, the RAF inmates stage a [[hunger strike]] which results in Meins' death. The German student movement considers this to be murder. The authorities then move Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] to [[Stammheim Prison]], where they work on their defense for their trial and smuggle orders outside.\n\nIn 1975, a group of younger RAF recruits [[West German Embassy siege|seize the West German embassy in Stockholm]]. The siege ends with a series of explosions, which kill several RAF members and injure the hostages. RAF member [[Siegfried Hausner]] survives the blast but is critically wounded, extradited to West Germany and dies in a prison hospital. The imprisoned RAF members are appalled by the poor execution of their orders for the Stockholm operation. Meanwhile, Herold's assistant asks why people who have never met Baader are willing to take orders from him. Herold replies, \"A myth.\"\n\nMeinhof, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and remorse over the deaths caused by their bombings, is subjected to sadistic emotional abuse by Baader and Ensslin, who call her a traitor and \"a knife in the RAF's back\". In response, Meinhof hangs herself in her cell. The imprisoned RAF members accuse West Germany's Government of murdering her during their trial and are widely believed.\n\nUpon completing her sentence [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]] takes over command of the RAF outside. She informs Boock that Baader has forbidden any more attacks on \"the people\" and enlists his help smuggling weapons into Stammheim. In retaliation for the \"murders\" of Meins, Hausner, and Meinhof, the RAF assassinates West Germany's Attorney General, [[Siegfried Buback]]. Mohnhaupt,  [[Christian Klar]], and [[Susanne Albrecht]], also attempt to kidnap [[Dresdner Bank]] President [[J\u00fcrgen Ponto]], who fights back and is shot dead. Knowing that the imprisoned RAF members have ordered both murders, the West German Government returns them to solitary confinement. Even so, Ensslin and Baader obtain two way radios and continue smuggling orders outside.\n\nMohnhaupt then abducts industrialist [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and demands the release of her imprisoned comrades in exchange for not killing him. When West German authorities fail to meet their demands, the RAF and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] hijack [[Lufthansa Flight 181]]. The hijacking ends with the plane being stormed and the hostages saved. In Stammheim, Baader warns a West German Government negotiator that the violence will continue to escalate. Ensslin makes the same prediction to the prison chaplain and claims that the West German Government is about to murder her and her imprisoned comrades.\n\nThe following morning, corrections officers find Baader and Raspe shot to death in their cells as the handguns Mohnhaupt smuggled into the prison lie nearby. Ensslin is found hanging from the steel bars of the window. They also find [[Irmgard M\u00f6ller]] stabbed four times in the chest, but still alive. When the news reaches the free RAF members, they are devastated and certain that the trio was murdered. To their shock, Mohnhaupt explains that Baader, Ensslin, M\u00f6ller, and Raspe \"are not victims and never were\". She explains, that they, like Meinhof, were \"in control of the outcome until the very end\". When the RAF members react with stunned disbelief, Mohnhaupt responds, \"You did not know them. Stop thinking that they were different than they were.\"\n\nIn a sign that RAF terrorism will continue, the last moments of the film show the murder of hostage Hanns-Martin Schleyer. In an ironic commentary on the violence of the era, [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" plays during the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Martina Gedeck]] as [[Ulrike Meinhof]]\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as [[Andreas Baader]]\n* [[Johanna Wokalek]] as [[Gudrun Ensslin]]\n* [[Nadja Uhl]] as [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]]\n* [[Stipe Erceg]] as [[Holger Meins]]\n* [[Niels-Bruno Schmidt]] as [[Jan Carl Raspe]]\n* [[Vinzenz Kiefer]] as [[Peter-Jurgen Boock]]\n* [[Simon Licht]] as [[Horst Mahler]]\n* [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as [[Petra Schelm]]\n* [[Daniel Lommatzsch]] as [[Christian Klar]]\n* [[Sebastian Blomberg]] as [[Rudi Dutschke]]\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as [[Horst Herold]]\n* [[Heino Ferch]] as Horst Herold's assistant\n* [[Jan Josef Liefers]] as [[Peter Homann (terrorist)|Peter Homann]]\n* [[Hannah Herzsprung]] as [[Susanne Albrecht]]\n* [[Tom Schilling]] as [[Josef Bachmann]]\n* [[Hans Werner Meyer]] as [[Klaus Rainer R\u00f6hl]]\n* [[Katharina Wackernagel]] as [[Astrid Proll]]\n* [[Anna Thalbach]] as Ingrid\n* [[Volker Bruch]] as [[Stefan Aust]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film began production in August 2007 with filming at several locations including [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stammheim Prison]], [[Rome]] and [[Morocco]].

Some who were older complained that the film had made the gang look too attractive. But they were dead-enders, and they were attractive.

He singled out the filmmakers' decision to strike against Hollywood's usual practice of glamorizing Marxist insurgents by making an explicit connection between revolutionary and criminal violence. By slowly erasing the difference between the two, Hitchens wrote that the film exposed the \"uneasy relationship between sexuality and cruelty, and between casual or cynical attitudes to both,\" as well as the \nRAF's tendency to offer unquestioning support to the most extreme factions of the Marxist and Islamist underground. Relating his own memories of West Germany during the era, Hitchens further described the RAF as \"a form of [[psychosis]]\" that swept through  the former [[Axis powers]] of Germany, Japan, and Italy a generation after the end of the [[Second World War]]. Comparing the RAF to the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the Italian [[Red Brigades]], Hitchens wrote, \"The propaganda of the terrorists showed an almost neurotic need to 'resist authority' in a way that their parents\u2019 generation had so terribly failed to do.\" In conclusion, Hitchens praised the film's depiction of an escalating cycle of violence and paranoia in \"which mania feeds upon itself and becomes hysterical.\"<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/hitchens-guerrillas200908?currentPage=1 Christopher Hitchens on The Baader Meinhof Complex] Vanity Fair, 17 August 2009</ref>\n\nFilm and Red Army Faction historian Christina Gerhardt wrote a more critical review for ''[[Film Quarterly (magazine)|Film Quarterly]]''. Arguing that its nonstop action failed to engage the historical and political events depicted, she wrote \"During its 150 minutes, the film achieves action-film momentum\u2014bombs exploding, bullets spraying, and glass shattering\u2014and this inevitably comes at the expense of quasi journalistic expos\u00e9 or historical excavation.\"<ref>[http://www.filmquarterly.org/2009/12/winter-2009-volume-63-no-2/] Film Quarterly, Winter 2009</ref>\n\nFrench movie director [[Olivier Assayas]], who had previously made a film about left-wing terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal]], wrote that the film addresses a very painful subject for modern Germany and called it, \"some kind of revolution.\" He admitted, however, that his own perspective was limited: \"I\u2019m not German and I\u2019m not an expert, but I never really bought the collective suicide theory.

Written and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], it stars [[Moritz Bleibtreu]], [[Martina Gedeck]], and [[Johanna Wokalek]]. The film is based on the 1985 German best selling non-fiction book of the same name by [[Stefan Aust]]. It retells the story of the early years of the [[West Germany|West German]] [[far-left]] [[terrorist organisation]] the ''[[Rote Armee Fraktion]]'' (Red Army Fraction, or Red Army Faction, a.k.a. RAF) from 1967 to 1977.\n\nThe film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn 2 June 1967, the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] visits [[West Berlin]] and attends a performance at the [[Deutsche Oper]]. Angered at his policies in governing Iran, members of the [[German student movement]] protest his appearance. The West Berlin police and the Shah's security team attack the protesters, and unarmed protester [[Benno Ohnesorg]] is fatally shot by Officer [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]].\n\nOhnesorg's death outrages West Germany, including [[left wing]] journalist [[Ulrike Meinhof]], who claims in a televised debate that the democratically elected government of West Germany is a [[Fascist]] [[police state]]. Inspired by Meinhof's rhetoric, charismatic radicals [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] mastermind the {{ill|Frankfurt department store firebombing|de|Kaufhaus-Brandstiftungen am 2. April 1968}} of 1968. While covering their trial, Ulrike Meinhof finds herself deeply moved by their commitment to [[armed struggle]] against what they see as a [[Neo-Nazi]] Government. She secures a jailhouse interview with Ensslin and the two strike up a close friendship.  Soon after, Meinhof leaves her husband for Peter Homann.\n\nMeanwhile, Ensslin and Baader have been released pending an appeal and attract various young people, including [[Astrid Proll]] and [[Peter-Jurgen Boock]]. After spending some time abroad, Baader, Ensslin and Proll return to West Germany and begin living with Meinhof. Increasingly bored with her middle class life, Meinhof longs to take more [[direct action|violent action]]. Even though Ensslin tells her that sacrifices must be made for the revolution, Meinhof does not wish to leave her children. But then, Baader is arrested. Using her connections, Meinhof is able to arrange for him to be interviewed off prison grounds, where Ensslin and the others rescue him. While the plan called for Meinhof to look like an innocent journalist caught in a prison break, she flees with Baader and Ensslin, thereby incriminating herself in the attempted murders of an unarmed civilian and two policemen.\n\nAfter leaving Meinhof's two children in [[Sicily]], the group receives training in a [[Fatah]] camp in [[Jordan]], where the egotistical and promiscuous Germans enrage their Muslim hosts. Homann leaves the group after overhearing Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin asking Fatah to kill him. Having also learned that Meinhof wishes to send her two children to a training camp for suicide bombers, Homann informs Meinhof's former colleague [[Stefan Aust]], who returns the children to their father.\n\nReturning to Germany and styling themselves the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), Baader and his followers launch a campaign of bank robberies. In response, [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] chief Horst Herold orders all local police to be put at Federal command for one day. During that day, RAF member [[Petra Schelm]] drives through a roadblock and is chased by two cops. When cornered, she refuses to go quietly, initiates a gunfight, and is fatally shot by the policemen's return fire. Regarding this as murder, Baader and Ensslin overrule Meinhof's objections and begin systematically bombing police stations and [[United States Military]] bases. As grisly footage of the maimed and the dead appears onscreen, Meinhof's press statements rationalizing the bombings are heard in [[voiceover]].\n\nAs the violence escalates, Herold orders the BKA to pioneer [[criminal profiling]] and members of the RAF begin to be arrested. Baader and [[Holger Meins]] are caught after a shoot-out with police. Ensslin and Meinhof are captured soon after. In separate prisons, the RAF inmates stage a [[hunger strike]] which results in Meins' death. The German student movement considers this to be murder. The authorities then move Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] to [[Stammheim Prison]], where they work on their defense for their trial and smuggle orders outside.\n\nIn 1975, a group of younger RAF recruits [[West German Embassy siege|seize the West German embassy in Stockholm]]. The siege ends with a series of explosions, which kill several RAF members and injure the hostages. RAF member [[Siegfried Hausner]] survives the blast but is critically wounded, extradited to West Germany and dies in a prison hospital. The imprisoned RAF members are appalled by the poor execution of their orders for the Stockholm operation. Meanwhile, Herold's assistant asks why people who have never met Baader are willing to take orders from him. Herold replies, \"A myth.\"\n\nMeinhof, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and remorse over the deaths caused by their bombings, is subjected to sadistic emotional abuse by Baader and Ensslin, who call her a traitor and \"a knife in the RAF's back\". In response, Meinhof hangs herself in her cell. The imprisoned RAF members accuse West Germany's Government of murdering her during their trial and are widely believed.\n\nUpon completing her sentence [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]] takes over command of the RAF outside. She informs Boock that Baader has forbidden any more attacks on \"the people\" and enlists his help smuggling weapons into Stammheim. In retaliation for the \"murders\" of Meins, Hausner, and Meinhof, the RAF assassinates West Germany's Attorney General, [[Siegfried Buback]]. Mohnhaupt,  [[Christian Klar]], and [[Susanne Albrecht]], also attempt to kidnap [[Dresdner Bank]] President [[J\u00fcrgen Ponto]], who fights back and is shot dead. Knowing that the imprisoned RAF members have ordered both murders, the West German Government returns them to solitary confinement. Even so, Ensslin and Baader obtain two way radios and continue smuggling orders outside.\n\nMohnhaupt then abducts industrialist [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and demands the release of her imprisoned comrades in exchange for not killing him. When West German authorities fail to meet their demands, the RAF and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] hijack [[Lufthansa Flight 181]]. The hijacking ends with the plane being stormed and the hostages saved. In Stammheim, Baader warns a West German Government negotiator that the violence will continue to escalate. Ensslin makes the same prediction to the prison chaplain and claims that the West German Government is about to murder her and her imprisoned comrades.\n\nThe following morning, corrections officers find Baader and Raspe shot to death in their cells as the handguns Mohnhaupt smuggled into the prison lie nearby. Ensslin is found hanging from the steel bars of the window. They also find [[Irmgard M\u00f6ller]] stabbed four times in the chest, but still alive. When the news reaches the free RAF members, they are devastated and certain that the trio was murdered. To their shock, Mohnhaupt explains that Baader, Ensslin, M\u00f6ller, and Raspe \"are not victims and never were\". She explains, that they, like Meinhof, were \"in control of the outcome until the very end\". When the RAF members react with stunned disbelief, Mohnhaupt responds, \"You did not know them. Stop thinking that they were different than they were.\"\n\nIn a sign that RAF terrorism will continue, the last moments of the film show the murder of hostage Hanns-Martin Schleyer. In an ironic commentary on the violence of the era, [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" plays during the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Martina Gedeck]] as [[Ulrike Meinhof]]\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as [[Andreas Baader]]\n* [[Johanna Wokalek]] as [[Gudrun Ensslin]]\n* [[Nadja Uhl]] as [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]]\n* [[Stipe Erceg]] as [[Holger Meins]]\n* [[Niels-Bruno Schmidt]] as [[Jan Carl Raspe]]\n* [[Vinzenz Kiefer]] as [[Peter-Jurgen Boock]]\n* [[Simon Licht]] as [[Horst Mahler]]\n* [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as [[Petra Schelm]]\n* [[Daniel Lommatzsch]] as [[Christian Klar]]\n* [[Sebastian Blomberg]] as [[Rudi Dutschke]]\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as [[Horst Herold]]\n* [[Heino Ferch]] as Horst Herold's assistant\n* [[Jan Josef Liefers]] as [[Peter Homann (terrorist)|Peter Homann]]\n* [[Hannah Herzsprung]] as [[Susanne Albrecht]]\n* [[Tom Schilling]] as [[Josef Bachmann]]\n* [[Hans Werner Meyer]] as [[Klaus Rainer R\u00f6hl]]\n* [[Katharina Wackernagel]] as [[Astrid Proll]]\n* [[Anna Thalbach]] as Ingrid\n* [[Volker Bruch]] as [[Stefan Aust]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film began production in August 2007 with filming at several locations including [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stammheim Prison]], [[Rome]] and [[Morocco]].

He singled out the filmmakers' decision to strike against Hollywood's usual practice of glamorizing Marxist insurgents by making an explicit connection between revolutionary and criminal violence. By slowly erasing the difference between the two, Hitchens wrote that the film exposed the \"uneasy relationship between sexuality and cruelty, and between casual or cynical attitudes to both,\" as well as the \nRAF's tendency to offer unquestioning support to the most extreme factions of the Marxist and Islamist underground. Relating his own memories of West Germany during the era, Hitchens further described the RAF as \"a form of [[psychosis]]\" that swept through  the former [[Axis powers]] of Germany, Japan, and Italy a generation after the end of the [[Second World War]]. Comparing the RAF to the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the Italian [[Red Brigades]], Hitchens wrote, \"The propaganda of the terrorists showed an almost neurotic need to 'resist authority' in a way that their parents\u2019 generation had so terribly failed to do.\" In conclusion, Hitchens praised the film's depiction of an escalating cycle of violence and paranoia in \"which mania feeds upon itself and becomes hysterical.\"<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/hitchens-guerrillas200908?currentPage=1 Christopher Hitchens on The Baader Meinhof Complex] Vanity Fair, 17 August 2009</ref>\n\nFilm and Red Army Faction historian Christina Gerhardt wrote a more critical review for ''[[Film Quarterly (magazine)|Film Quarterly]]''.

For me it\u2019s absolutely impossible to believe. So I don\u2019t think ''The Baader Meinhof Complex'' fully addresses the issue.
