It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]] and is part of the [[Mid-East Region, Ireland|Mid-East Region]]. It is named after the village of [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. [[Louth County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. According to the 2016 census, the population of the county was 128,884.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\nLouth is a kip  \n\nWith its fairly average total population and its small size, Louth is the second-most densely populated county in Ireland, behind [[County Dublin|Dublin]], and the fourth-most on the island of Ireland.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Dundalk#History|label 1=History of Dundalk | Drogheda#History|label 2=History of Drogheda}}\n\n[[File:Baronies of Louth.jpg|thumb|Baronies of Louth]]\nCounty Louth is named after the village of Louth, which in turn is named after [[Lugh]], a god of the ancient Irish. Historically, the placename has had various spellings; \"Lugmad\", \"Lughmhaigh\", and \"Lughmhadh\" (see [[County Louth Historic Names|Historic Names List]], for full listing). ''L\u00fa'' is the modern [[Irish orthography|simplified spelling]].\n\nThe county is steeped in myth, legend and history, and is a setting in the [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]. Later it saw the influence of the [[Viking]]s, as seen in the name of [[Carlingford Lough]]. They also established a [[longphort]] at [[Annagassan]] in the ninth century. At this time Louth consisted of three sub-kingdoms, each subject to separate over-kingdoms: [[Conaille Muirtheimne|Conaille]] ([[Ulaid]]h); Fir Rois ([[Airgialla]]); and, the Fir Arda Ciannachta ([[Kingdom of Mide|Midhe]]). The whole area became part of the O'Carroll Kingdom of Airgialla (Oriel) early in the 12th century under [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]]. At the same time, the area was removed from the diocese of Armagh and the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Bishop of Clogher|Diocese of Airg\u00edalla or Clogher]] was transferred to Louth ''c.'' 1130-1190.\n\nA number of historic sites are in the county, including religious sites at [[Monasterboice]], [[Mellifont Abbey]] and the [[Magdalene Tower, Drogheda|St Mary Magdalene Dominican Friary]].\n\nThe Normans occupied the Louth area in the 1180s, and it became known as 'English' Oriel, to distinguish it from the remainder ('Irish' Oriel) which remained in Irish hands. The latter became the [[McMahon]] lordship of Oriel of [[County Monaghan]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Scottish army of [[Edward Bruce]] was repulsed from [[Drogheda]]. Edward was finally defeated, losing his claim to the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] along with his life, in the [[Battle of Faughart]] near Dundalk, by a chiefly local force led by [[John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth|John de Bermingham]].\n\nIn 1189, a royal charter was granted to [[Dundalk]] after a Norman nobleman named [[Bertram de Verdun]] erected a manor house at Castletown Mount. Later in 1412, a royal charter was granted to Drogheda. This charter unified the towns of Drogheda-in-[[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] and Drogheda-in-[[Airg\u00edalla|Uriel (Louth)]] as a [[County Corporate|County in its own right]], styled as \u2018the County of the town of Drogheda\u2019.<ref name=\"Johnston 1826 37\">{{cite book|last=Johnston |first=L.

[[Siege of Drogheda|Oliver Cromwell attacked Drogheda in 1649]] slaughtering the Royalist garrison and hundreds of the town's citizens. Towards the end of the same century, the armies of the warring Kings, [[James II]] and [[William III of England|William (III) of Orange]], faced off in south Louth during the build-up to the [[Battle of the Boyne]]; the battle was fought 3&nbsp;km west from Drogheda. Drogheda held for James under Lord Iveagh, but surrendered to William the day after the battle of the Boyne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1798, the leaders of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] included Bartholomew Teeling, John Byrne, and Patrick Byrne, all from Castletown; Anthony Marmion from Louth Town and Dundalk, Anthony McCann from Corderry; Nicholas and Thomas Markey from Barmeath, and Arthur McKeown, John Warren, and James McAllister from Cambricville. They were betrayed by informers, notably a Dr. Conlan, who came from Dundalk, and an ''agent provocateur'' called Sam Turner, from Newry. Several leaders were hanged.\n\nThe priest and scientist [[Nicholas Callan]] (1799\u20131864) was from Darver.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| state=collapsed\n|1600|3454\n|1610|6787\n|1653|8527\n|1659|9690\n|1821|119129\n|1831|124846\n|1841|128240\n|1851|107662\n|1861|90713\n|1871|84021\n|1881|77684\n|1891|71038\n|1901|65820\n|1911|63665\n|1926|62739\n|1936|64339\n|1946|66194\n|1951|68771\n|1956|69194\n|1961|67378\n|1966|69519\n|1971|74951\n|1979|86135\n|1981|88514\n|1986|91810\n|1991|90724\n|1996|92166\n|2002|101821\n|2006|111267\n|2011|122897\n|2016|128884\n||footnote=<ref name=cso2016/><ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|author=|date=|website=www.cso.ie|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/|url-status=dead|title=HISTPOP.ORG - Home|archivedate=7 May 2016|website=www.histpop.org}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |date=17 February 2012 }}.

Historically, the placename has had various spellings; \"Lugmad\", \"Lughmhaigh\", and \"Lughmhadh\" (see [[County Louth Historic Names|Historic Names List]], for full listing). ''L\u00fa'' is the modern [[Irish orthography|simplified spelling]].\n\nThe county is steeped in myth, legend and history, and is a setting in the [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]. Later it saw the influence of the [[Viking]]s, as seen in the name of [[Carlingford Lough]]. They also established a [[longphort]] at [[Annagassan]] in the ninth century. At this time Louth consisted of three sub-kingdoms, each subject to separate over-kingdoms: [[Conaille Muirtheimne|Conaille]] ([[Ulaid]]h); Fir Rois ([[Airgialla]]); and, the Fir Arda Ciannachta ([[Kingdom of Mide|Midhe]]). The whole area became part of the O'Carroll Kingdom of Airgialla (Oriel) early in the 12th century under [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]]. At the same time, the area was removed from the diocese of Armagh and the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Bishop of Clogher|Diocese of Airg\u00edalla or Clogher]] was transferred to Louth ''c.'' 1130-1190.\n\nA number of historic sites are in the county, including religious sites at [[Monasterboice]], [[Mellifont Abbey]] and the [[Magdalene Tower, Drogheda|St Mary Magdalene Dominican Friary]].\n\nThe Normans occupied the Louth area in the 1180s, and it became known as 'English' Oriel, to distinguish it from the remainder ('Irish' Oriel) which remained in Irish hands. The latter became the [[McMahon]] lordship of Oriel of [[County Monaghan]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Scottish army of [[Edward Bruce]] was repulsed from [[Drogheda]]. Edward was finally defeated, losing his claim to the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] along with his life, in the [[Battle of Faughart]] near Dundalk, by a chiefly local force led by [[John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth|John de Bermingham]].\n\nIn 1189, a royal charter was granted to [[Dundalk]] after a Norman nobleman named [[Bertram de Verdun]] erected a manor house at Castletown Mount. Later in 1412, a royal charter was granted to Drogheda. This charter unified the towns of Drogheda-in-[[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] and Drogheda-in-[[Airg\u00edalla|Uriel (Louth)]] as a [[County Corporate|County in its own right]], styled as \u2018the County of the town of Drogheda\u2019.<ref name=\"Johnston 1826 37\">{{cite book|last=Johnston |first=L.

[[Siege of Drogheda|Oliver Cromwell attacked Drogheda in 1649]] slaughtering the Royalist garrison and hundreds of the town's citizens. Towards the end of the same century, the armies of the warring Kings, [[James II]] and [[William III of England|William (III) of Orange]], faced off in south Louth during the build-up to the [[Battle of the Boyne]]; the battle was fought 3&nbsp;km west from Drogheda. Drogheda held for James under Lord Iveagh, but surrendered to William the day after the battle of the Boyne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1798, the leaders of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] included Bartholomew Teeling, John Byrne, and Patrick Byrne, all from Castletown; Anthony Marmion from Louth Town and Dundalk, Anthony McCann from Corderry; Nicholas and Thomas Markey from Barmeath, and Arthur McKeown, John Warren, and James McAllister from Cambricville. They were betrayed by informers, notably a Dr. Conlan, who came from Dundalk, and an ''agent provocateur'' called Sam Turner, from Newry.

A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the [[Abbey Theatre]], and in his later years served two terms as a [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] of the [[Irish Free State]]. He was a driving force behind the [[Irish Literary Revival]] along with [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]], [[Edward Martyn]] and others.\n\nYeats was born in [[Sandymount]], Ireland, and educated there and in London. He spent childhood holidays in [[County Sligo]] and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]] and the [[occult]]. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and [[Literary realism|realistic]]. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born in [[Sandymount]] in [[County Dublin]], Ireland.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/> His father, [[John Butler Yeats]] (1839\u20131922), was a descendant of Jervis Yeats, a [[William III of England|Williamite]] soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter, who died in 1712.<ref>Jeffares, A.

Soon after William's birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\".{{sfn|Yeats|1994|p=vii}} So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\".<ref>W. B. Yeats, ''Autobiographies'' (1956), p. 12. London: Macmillan.</ref> The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack]] became an esteemed painter, while his sisters [[Elizabeth Yeats|Elizabeth]] and [[Lily Yeats|Susan Mary]]\u2014known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily\u2014became involved in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].<ref>Gordon Bowe, Nicola. \"Two Early Twentieth-Century Irish Arts and Crafts Workshops in Context\". ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 2, No. 2/3 (1989). 193\u2013206</ref>\n\nYeats was raised a member of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxviii}} Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby [[Slough]] countryside.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=24}} On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the [[Godolphin and Latymer School|Godolphin school]],{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=28}} which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=25}} Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]]<ref>Sessa, Anne Dzamba; ''Richard Wagner and the English''; p. 130. {{ISBN|0-8386-2055-8}}</ref>), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road.<ref name=chiswick>[http://www.chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&page=conyeats.htm Yeats in Bedford Park], chiswickw4.com</ref> For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of [[Harold's Cross]]{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=119}} and later [[Howth]]. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's [[The High School, Dublin|Erasmus Smith High School]].{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=33}} His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the ''Dublin University Review'' published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of [[Samuel Ferguson|Sir Samuel Ferguson]]\". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art\u2014now the [[National College of Art and Design]]\u2014in [[Thomas Street, Dublin|Thomas Street]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park.<ref>[https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ \"The attraction of Bedford Park\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001450/https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ |date=19 October 2018 }} by Amy Davies, 8 April 2013, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]</ref> The rent on the house was \u00a350 a year.<ref name=chiswick />\n\nHe began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem\u2014heavily influenced by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]\u2014that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=37}} Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, [[Edmund Spenser]], and on the diction and colouring of [[pre-Raphaelite]] verse, he soon turned to [[Irish mythology|Irish mythology and folklore]] and the writings of [[William Blake]]. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the \"great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan\".<ref>[[Tom Paulin|Paulin, Tom]].

Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s.

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.{{sfn|Jordan|2000|pp=13\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Portrait drawing of WB Yeats by JS Sargent.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Charcoal portrait of Yeats by [[John Singer Sargent]] (1908)]]\n\nYeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":{{sfn|Malins|Purkis|1994|page=124}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great [[Hector]] down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"].

Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\"<ref>Monroe, Harriet (1913). \"Poetry\". (Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123</ref> From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.<ref>Sands, Maren. \"[http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sands.htm The Influence of Japanese Noh Theater on Yeats]\". Colorado State University. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V.

He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F.

According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride.<ref>Gonne MacBride, Maud. ''A Servant of the Queen''.

The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"<ref>Brown, Terence.

During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule.{{sfn|Foster|2003|p=468}} His later association with Pound drew him towards [[Benito Mussolini]], for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Moses\" /> He wrote three \"marching songs\"\u2014never used\u2014for the Irish General [[Eoin O'Duffy]]'s [[Blueshirts]].\n\n[[File:Chantry House, Steyning.jpg|thumb|[[Chantry House, Steyning|Chantry House]], [[Steyning]].

B. Yeats bibliography|:Category:Works by W. B. Yeats}}\n\nYeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a [[Symbolist]] poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols<ref>[[Barry Ulanov|Ulanov, Barry]]. ''Makers of the Modern Theater''. McGraw-Hill, 1961</ref> is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.<ref>Gale Research International. ''Twentieth Century Literary Criticism'', No. 116''. Gale Cengage Learning, 2002, p. 303</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[modernism|modernists]] who experimented with [[free verse]], Yeats was a master of the traditional forms.<ref>Finneran, Richard. ''Yeats: An Annual of Critical and Textual Studies 1995''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. 82</ref> The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes ''In the Seven Woods'', ''Responsibilities'' and ''The Green Helmet''.<ref>Logenbach, James. ''Stone Cottage: Pound, Yeats, and Modernism''.

Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease [[Riversdale]] house in the Dublin suburb of [[Rathfarnham]] in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play ''[[Purgatory (drama)|Purgatory]]''.

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1990, pp. 327\u2013329. {{ISBN|0-389-20951-1}}</ref>\n\nSome critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as [[Pablo Picasso]] did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] variety.<ref>Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80</ref>\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W.

These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].

While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales.

The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage.

Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex.

Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"].

The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write.

Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V. ''A Reader's Guide to Modern Irish Drama'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 48</ref> Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the [[Easter Rising]], even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\n\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the [[Blueshirts]], although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece.

At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.\n\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] (1892\u20131968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear.

The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]].

During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule.{{sfn|Foster|2003|p=468}} His later association with Pound drew him towards [[Benito Mussolini]], for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Moses\" /> He wrote three \"marching songs\"\u2014never used\u2014for the Irish General [[Eoin O'Duffy]]'s [[Blueshirts]].\n\n[[File:Chantry House, Steyning.jpg|thumb|[[Chantry House, Steyning|Chantry House]], [[Steyning]].

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]].

His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W.

Some of these words were created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cacha\u00e7a was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate ''[[grappa]]''. There are more than two thousand words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate.<ref name=\"Cavalcante, Messias Soares 2011\"/> Some of these nicknames are: ''abre-cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' (heart-opener), ''\u00e1gua-benta'' (holy water), ''bafo-de-tigre'' (tiger breath), and ''limpa-olho'' (eye-wash).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |title=Cacha\u00e7a Nicknames &#124; The Almanac of Yum |publisher=Almanacofyum.wordpress.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102161608/http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Difference from rum ==\n\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas used the by-products of sugar, [[molasses]] and scummings as the raw material for the production of alcoholic spirits. The resulting beverage was known by several names: in British colonies, it was named ''rum;'' in France, ''tafia;'' in Spain, ''aguardiente de ca\u00f1a;'' and in Portugal (Brazil), ''aguardente da terra'', ''aguardente de cana'' and later ''cacha\u00e7a''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nThe major difference between cacha\u00e7a and [[rum]] is that rum is usually made from [[molasses]], a by-product after a refinery boils the cane juice to extract as much sugar crystal as possible, while cacha\u00e7a is made from fresh sugarcane juice, fermented and distilled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocktailtimes.com/dictionary/cachacas.shtml |title=> Dictionary |publisher=Cocktail Times |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> Some rums&mdash;in particular the ''[[rhum agricole]]'' of the [[French Caribbean]]&mdash;are also made by this process, cacha\u00e7a is also known as '''Brazilian rum'''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nIn the United States, cacha\u00e7a is recognized as a type of rum and distinctive Brazilian product after an agreement was signed in 2013 with Brazil in which it will drop the usage of the term Brazilian rum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colitt |first=Raymond |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/brazil-u-s-move-to-boost-cachaca-tennessee-whiskey-trade-1-.html |title= Brazil, U.S. Move to Boost Cachaca, Tennessee Whiskey Trade |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-02-25/pdf/2013-04242.pdf |title=TTB Amends the Distilled Spirits Identity Regulations to Recognize \"Cacha\u00e7a\" as a Type of Rum and Distinctive Product of Brazil |publisher=gpo.gov |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Liquor|Drink|Brazil}}\n* [[Clairin]]\n* [[Cocktails with cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of brands of Cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of Brazilian drinks]]\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cacha\u00e7a}}\n* [http://www.cnn.folderpark.net/ O \u00c1lbum Virtual de R\u00f3tulos de Garrafas de Cacha\u00e7a na Net]\u2014Web site dedicated to cacha\u00e7a labels.

[http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/dining/09cachaca.html \"Allure of Cacha\u00e7a Spreads to U.S. From Brazil\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 9, 2008. Accessed 1 June 2009.</ref>\n\nThere are very important regions in Brazil where fine [[pot still]] cacha\u00e7a is produced such as Ch\u00e3 Grande in [[Pernambuco]] state, Salinas in [[Minas Gerais]] state, [[Paraty]] in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state, Monte Alegre do Sul in [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] state and Aba\u00edra in [[Bahia]] state. Nowadays, producers of cacha\u00e7a can be found in most Brazilian regions and in 2011 there were over 40,000 of them.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\n== Synonyms ==\nFor more than four centuries of history, cacha\u00e7a has accumulated synonyms and creative nicknames coined by the Brazilian people. Some of these words were created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cacha\u00e7a was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate ''[[grappa]]''. There are more than two thousand words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate.<ref name=\"Cavalcante, Messias Soares 2011\"/> Some of these nicknames are: ''abre-cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' (heart-opener), ''\u00e1gua-benta'' (holy water), ''bafo-de-tigre'' (tiger breath), and ''limpa-olho'' (eye-wash).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |title=Cacha\u00e7a Nicknames &#124; The Almanac of Yum |publisher=Almanacofyum.wordpress.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102161608/http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Difference from rum ==\n\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas used the by-products of sugar, [[molasses]] and scummings as the raw material for the production of alcoholic spirits. The resulting beverage was known by several names: in British colonies, it was named ''rum;'' in France, ''tafia;'' in Spain, ''aguardiente de ca\u00f1a;'' and in Portugal (Brazil), ''aguardente da terra'', ''aguardente de cana'' and later ''cacha\u00e7a''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nThe major difference between cacha\u00e7a and [[rum]] is rum is usually made from [[molasses]], a by-product after a refinery boils the cane juice to extract as much sugar crystal as possible, while cacha\u00e7a is made from fresh sugarcane juice, fermented and distilled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocktailtimes.com/dictionary/cachacas.shtml |title=> Dictionary |publisher=Cocktail Times |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> Some rums&mdash;in particular the ''[[rhum agricole]]'' of the [[French Caribbean]]&mdash;are also made by this process, cacha\u00e7a is also known as '''Brazilian rum'''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nIn the United States, cacha\u00e7a is recognized as a type of rum and distinctive Brazilian product after an agreement was signed in 2013 with Brazil in which it will drop the usage of the term Brazilian rum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colitt |first=Raymond |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/brazil-u-s-move-to-boost-cachaca-tennessee-whiskey-trade-1-.html |title= Brazil, U.S. Move to Boost Cachaca, Tennessee Whiskey Trade |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-02-25/pdf/2013-04242.pdf |title=TTB Amends the Distilled Spirits Identity Regulations to Recognize \"Cacha\u00e7a\" as a Type of Rum and Distinctive Product of Brazil |publisher=gpo.gov |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Liquor|Drink|Brazil}}\n* [[Clairin]]\n* [[Cocktails with cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of brands of Cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of Brazilian drinks]]\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cacha\u00e7a}}\n* [http://www.cnn.folderpark.net/ O \u00c1lbum Virtual de R\u00f3tulos de Garrafas de Cacha\u00e7a na Net]\u2014Web site dedicated to cacha\u00e7a labels.

This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.<ref name=\"Sawhney and Prandelli (2000)\"/>\n\n== Significance of the role of Communities in Organizations ==\nQuoting Mintzberg (2009), Lim and Ong (2019) points out that managers need to re-discover the essence of communities in the organizations in order to appropriately manage people within the organizations, who are not simply an organizational resource to be exploited, but who are the very organization itself. In other words, employees who feel they are valued and fairly treated by their organizations will usually work generously and in times of need, sacrificially for the success of the organization of which they feel they are a part of. However, employees who perceive themselves as being exploited, or possibly next on the retrenchment list, will more often than not put in only minimal work for the organization.<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\">Michael Lim, Bee Yong Ong, (2019) \u201cCommunities of innovation\u201d, International Journal of Innovation Science, Vol. 11, pp. 402-418; https://communities-innovation.com/</ref><ref name=\"Mintzberg (2009)\">Mintzberg, H.

Building on the literature on innovation, they termed the first and third macro-processes the divergence ([[knowledge sharing]], search activities, exploratory, and idea generation) and convergence (elimination of alternatives and narrowing down towards a choice, implementation, exploitation, and commercialization of ideas) macro-processes of community innovation. They termed the second macro-process the gateway macro-process (evaluation of new knowledge creation, selection, prioritization, control, idea screening and advocacy) as they observed that it consists of the critical processes which the organization uses to choose ideas to endorse for further development. It is the gateway through which informal communities of innovation may enter to become formal communities of innovation within the organization.\n\nThe macro-process of divergence management begins with individuals within the community of innovation building trust, sharing and discussing ideas, agreeing to develop ideas together and to seek recognition or funding from their organization. The macro-process of gateway management then evaluates the preliminary results for recognition or funding with the outcome as either funding approved or not approved for the development of the new products or services. Finally, if the funding is approved, the group dynamics of the community of innovation then becomes formalized within the organization, bringing about the development and implementation of new products or services within the macro-process of convergence management. <ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/>\n\n==== The Macro-processes of Community Innovation Management<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/> ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An example is an innovation project which involves only staff from the engineering department. It is also possible for communities of innovation to be cross-functional (e.g. involving  2-3 functions). An example is an innovation project which involves staff from two functions, the business department and the environmental science department. In their research, they observed that cross-functional communities of innovation were able to consider problems from more perspectives and come up with more varied solutions. However, cross-functional communities of innovation usually require more time for discussions due to the difference in the members\u2019 level of knowledge concerning different topics and their associated jargons.<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/>\n\n==== The differences between Communities of Practice (CoP) and Communities of Innovation (CoI)<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/> ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

CoPs are very similar to CoIs; however, the two differ in a number of critical ways. They can be easily confused between.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Lippitz|first=Michael|last2=Wolcott|first2=Robert|last3=Andersen|first3=J\u00f8rn|date=January 2013|title=Innovation Communities: Trust, Mutual Learning and Action|url=http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2012/2012_22%20Innovation%20communities_Trust-Mutual-Learning-and-Action_web.pdf|journal=Nordic Innovation Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA CoP is able to connect the attitudes and values of dissimilar organizations. For example, a researcher may have a similar skill-set as someone working at a corporation; however, they may have very different tacit knowledge and motivation. The formation of a CoP can bring these separate groups with different motivations to form a beneficial partnership.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nCoPs and CoIs share many traits and are closely related{{snd}} so much so that a CoI can be deemed to be a type of CoP. CoIs are, however, different in certain critical ways not routinely addressed by CoPs, ways that are vital in the process of innovation. CoIs are focused on innovation, and while skills and processes can be transplanted across organizations, innovation processes and methods cannot, without significant customization and adaptation.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother element that separates a CoI is \"inspiration to action\", which refers to the relationships formed between kindred spirits{{snd}} relationships providing support and inspiration for taking on the uphill battle of creating significant change and embarking on new possibilities. In contrast, this process of innovation and bringing about significant change{{snd}} is not well integrated with corporate strategy.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Drivers of Collaborative Innovation ==\nDrivers of organizational innovativeness include team processes and external knowledge (Rose et al., 2016) and networking (Lewis et al., 2018).<ref name=\"Rose et al. (2016)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = J. | last2 = Jones | first2 = M. | last3 = Furneaux | first3 = B. | year = 2016 | title = An integrated model of innovation drivers for smaller software firms | url = | journal = Information & Management | volume = 53 | issue = 3| pages = 307\u2013323 }}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis et al.

They, therefore, have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization's dual capabilities of managing the current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.<ref name=\"Raisch & Birkinshaw (2008)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Raisch | first1 = S. | last2 = Birkinshaw | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 375\u2013409 }}</ref>\n\n== Examples of communities of innovation ==\nExamples of communities of innovation in history include the communities behind steam engines, iron and steel production, and textile machinery. The Pig Iron industry of Cleveland in the UK during 1850\u20131870 is a prime example of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bessen|first=James|last2=Nuvolari|first2=Alessandro|date=October 14, 2011|title=Knowledge Sharing Among Inventors: Some Historical Perspectives|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a5ff/516e03215e76a4c6baf292e17942e0c0f2db.pdf|journal=Boston University School of Law|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, the software industry has exhibited the most significant presence of CoIs. 96% of software products developed in 2016 used [[open source software]]. Particularly, in software that runs the computing infrastructure of the internet, open source is ubiquitous. Prime examples of open source software created through communities of innovation include [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[GIMP]], [[GNOME]], [[Apache OpenOffice|Apache]], [[PostgreSQL|PostgresQL]] and [[PHP]], besides [[Linux]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@johnmark/why-open-source-failed-6cae5d6a9f6|title=Why Open Source Failed|last=Mark|first=John|date=2018-07-30|website=John Mark|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n=== The CoI that developed Linux ===\nTraditionally, the company is the most efficient means of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement, and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms boundaries.<ref name=\"Lee and Cole (2003)\">Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.</ref> To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how \"thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]]\": the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is a value system, recognition, and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], the knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, \"the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,\" even across firms' boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|Coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.\n\n== Benefits and disadvantages of communities of innovation ==\nAccording to Henry Chesbrough, over the twentieth century, the closed innovation paradigm was overtaken by the theory of open innovation, which emphasizes the significantly higher importance of external resources<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}} thanks to an increasing trend towards globalization, new market participants, and simultaneously shorter product life cycles with correspondingly increasing R&D costs.\n\nInnovation through CoIs has many benefits when compared to proprietary or closed-off product development. Particularly, individual innovators and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to gain most from open innovation collaborations due to their inherently limited capabilities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sungjoo|first=Lee|last2=Gwangman|first2=Park|last3=Byungun|first3=Yoon|last4=Park|first4=Jinwoo|date=March 2010|title=Open innovation in SMEs: An intermediated network model|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733309002248|journal=Research Policy|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the most popular Open Source tools and applications{{snd}} developed through collaboration among their respective communities of innovation (such as software like Linux, Apache Web Server, PostgresSQL and PHP) were compared with similar proprietary software, Gartner<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/en|title=Gartner: Fueling the Future of Business|website=Gartner|language=en|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> found that open source bested or equaled the quality of their proprietary cousins and that many open source developers and advocates are gainfully employed and at very little risk of losing future work prospects. Open source products development has proven to be an efficient way of exhibiting skills.\n\nAccording to the Technology and Innovation Management Review, open innovation generally provides the following benefits: Broader base of ideas, Technological synergy, Improvement of the internal learning capacity through the transfer of external knowledge and learning routines and Use of intellectual property as strategic assets.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Ullrich|first=Andr\u00e9|last2=Vladova|first2=Gergana|date=2016|title=Weighing the Pros and Cons of Engaging in Open Innovation|journal=Technology Innovation Management Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=34\u201340|issn=1927-0321|doi=10.22215/timreview/980}}</ref>\n\nHowever, open innovation is also associated with a slow or delayed development Pace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology|last=Chesbrough|first=Henry|publisher=Boston: Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAlso, over time it has been proven{{snd}} especially in the case of communities of innovation in the software industry{{snd}} that due to the nature of patent and intellectual property law, the dream of open source software as advanced by its advocates{{snd}} has failed. It was believed that democratization of software would result in shared ownership of its intellectual property, but that hasn't happened. Software built using open source software{{snd}} is then patented and closed to external collaboration by wealthy companies, who profit much more from the results than the communities of innovation involved in developing the underlying technologies. This leads to greater wealth inequality, as opposed to social good.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|last2=Boettiger|first2=Sara|date=2005-01-08|title=Open Source Patenting|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=645182}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an article in ''Technology and Innovation Management Review'', open innovation generally suffers from the following disadvantages: strong dependence on external knowledge; loss of key knowledge control; loss of flexibility, creativity, and strategic power.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== History ==\nThere is evidence that, contrary to the popular belief, communities of innovation such as those in [[open source software]], are not a recent development.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are many examples in history in which innovators have used collective invention as in the cases of textile machinery, steam engines, and the production of iron and steel. In these cases, the innovators' behavior was largely dependent on public policy that accommodated knowledge sharing to foster cumulative innovation. Sometimes, knowledge sharing coexisted with [[patent]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite the historical precedent, today knowledge sharing among innovators is generally regarded as a modern development. The cost for information exchange has drastically decreased due, in a large part, to breakthroughs within the information and communication fields. According to Henry Chesborough (2003),<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> modern open innovation is often seen as, \"a sharp break from the paradigm of the early twentieth century when research labs were largely self sufficient{{snd}} only occasionally receiving outside visitors, and researchers would seldom venture out to visit universities or scientific expositions\". In history, the \"heroic inventor\" is shown greater consideration than the cooperation of innovators.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStories of innovative heroes were believed to be more fascinating than other narratives, such as the stories of often nameless farmers, who created and shared new types of wheat on the [[Great Plains]]. This demonstrates the cultural shift that caused the \"heroic inventor\" to be nationally celebrated in Britain and all Western countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nKnowledge sharing often occurred in the past, though there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not it occurs more frequently today. However, it is known that tension has existed for some time between the depth and scope of open knowledge sharing and the patent system.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmong the foremost examples of collective innovation in the past is Cleveland's Pig Iron industry in the UK during 1850\u20131870. This industry experienced a \"free exchange of information about new techniques and plant designs among firms in an industry\".<ref name=\":0\" /> According to economic historian Robert Allen, the proliferation of knowledge sharing in the iron district had two plausible reasons.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Robert|date=March 1983|title=Collective invention|url=|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(83)90023-9|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization|volume=4|pages=1\u201324}}</ref> First, afterword traveled of a prosperous blast furnace design, the reputations of engineers grew to be more positive. This only increased profits and allowed engineers to improve their careers. Second, such disclosures could cause the value of the revealing party's assets to decrease. Improving the blast furnace designs, in turn, led to an increase in the values of iron ore deposits, because these Cleveland ore mines were often owned by the blast furnace firms. This possibly made revealing technical information freely a profitable activity from the individual firm's point of view.<ref name=\":1\" /> Similarities can be drawn to today's communities of innovation, where the primary motivation for participants is recognition and potential career advancement, and for participating firms is related profit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt is yet to be understood how the rivalry between firms and innovators (that caused knowledge sharing to exist) came to be, while which conditions actually lead to aggressive rivalry and patenting. Bessen and Nuvolari (2011) mention that \"...&nbsp;as the technology matures, the nature of firms rivalry, their willingness to share knowledge and their use of patents correspondingly change. In particular, knowledge sharing is more likely to occur during the early phases of technology or where local innovation has little effect on worldwide prices.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Tacit knowledge]]\n* [[Online participation]]\n* [[Social capital]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/innovation/communication.htm \"Communication on Innovation policy: updating the Union's approach in the context of the Lisbon strategy\"].

Building on the literature on innovation, they termed the first and third macro-processes the divergence ([[knowledge sharing]], search activities, exploratory, and idea generation) and convergence (elimination of alternatives and narrowing down towards a choice, implementation, exploitation, and commercialization of ideas) macro-processes of community innovation. They termed the second macro-process the gateway macro-process (evaluation of new knowledge creation, selection, prioritization, control, idea screening and advocacy) as they observed that it consists of the critical processes which the organization uses to choose ideas to endorse for further development. It is the gateway through which informal communities of innovation may enter to become formal communities of innovation within the organization.\n\nThe macro-process of divergence management begins with individuals within the community of innovation building trust, sharing and discussing ideas, agreeing to develop ideas together and to seek recognition or funding from their organization. The macro-process of gateway management then evaluates the preliminary results for recognition or funding with the outcome as either funding approved or not approved for the development of the new products or services. Finally, if the funding is approved, the group dynamics of the community of innovation then becomes formalized within the organization, bringing about the development and implementation of new products or services within the macro-process of convergence management. <ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/>\n\n==== The Macro-processes of Community Innovation Management<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/> ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An example is an innovation project which involves only staff from the engineering department. It is also possible for communities of innovation to be cross-functional (e.g. involving  2-3 functions). An example is an innovation project which involves staff from two functions, the business department and the environmental science department. In their research, they observed that cross-functional communities of innovation were able to consider problems from more perspectives and come up with more varied solutions. However, cross-functional communities of innovation usually require more time for discussions due to the difference in the members\u2019 level of knowledge concerning different topics and their associated jargons.<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/>\n\n==== The differences between Communities of Practice (CoP) and Communities of Innovation (CoI)<ref name=\"Lim and Ong (2019)\"/> ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

CoPs are very similar to CoIs; however, the two differ in a number of critical ways. They can be easily confused between.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Lippitz|first=Michael|last2=Wolcott|first2=Robert|last3=Andersen|first3=J\u00f8rn|date=January 2013|title=Innovation Communities: Trust, Mutual Learning and Action|url=http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2012/2012_22%20Innovation%20communities_Trust-Mutual-Learning-and-Action_web.pdf|journal=Nordic Innovation Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA CoP is able to connect the attitudes and values of dissimilar organizations. For example, a researcher may have a similar skill-set as someone working at a corporation; however, they may have very different tacit knowledge and motivation. The formation of a CoP can bring these separate groups with different motivations to form a beneficial partnership.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nCoPs and CoIs share many traits and are closely related{{snd}} so much so that a CoI can be deemed to be a type of CoP. CoIs are, however, different in certain critical ways not routinely addressed by CoPs, ways that are vital in the process of innovation. CoIs are focused on innovation, and while skills and processes can be transplanted across organizations, innovation processes and methods cannot, without significant customization and adaptation.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother element that separates a CoI is \"inspiration to action\", which refers to the relationships formed between kindred spirits{{snd}} relationships providing support and inspiration for taking on the uphill battle of creating significant change and embarking on new possibilities. In contrast, this process of innovation and bringing about significant change{{snd}} is not well integrated with corporate strategy.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Drivers of Collaborative Innovation ==\nDrivers of organizational innovativeness include team processes and external knowledge (Rose et al., 2016) and networking (Lewis et al., 2018).<ref name=\"Rose et al. (2016)\"> Rose, J., Jones, M. and Furneaux, B.

(2018), \"How innovation drivers, networking and leadership shape public sector innovation capacity\", International Review of Administrative Sciences, Vol. 84 No. 2, pp. 288-307./</ref>\n\n== Communities of Innovation and Organizational ambidexterity ==\nSuccessful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They, therefore, have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization's dual capabilities of managing the current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.<ref name=\"Raisch & Birkinshaw (2008)\">Raisch, S., and J. Birkinshaw. 2008. Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. Journal of Management 34 (3) 375-409</ref>\n\n== Examples of communities of innovation ==\nExamples of communities of innovation in history include the communities behind steam engines, iron and steel production, and textile machinery. The Pig Iron industry of Cleveland in the UK during 1850\u20131870 is a prime example of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bessen|first=James|last2=Nuvolari|first2=Alessandro|date=October 14, 2011|title=Knowledge Sharing Among Inventors: Some Historical Perspectives|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a5ff/516e03215e76a4c6baf292e17942e0c0f2db.pdf|journal=Boston University School of Law|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, the software industry has exhibited the most significant presence of CoIs. 96% of software products developed in 2016 used [[open source software]]. Particularly, in software that runs the computing infrastructure of the internet, open source is ubiquitous. Prime examples of open source software created through communities of innovation include [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[GIMP]], [[GNOME]], [[Apache OpenOffice|Apache]], [[PostgreSQL|PostgresQL]] and [[PHP]], besides [[Linux]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@johnmark/why-open-source-failed-6cae5d6a9f6|title=Why Open Source Failed|last=Mark|first=John|date=2018-07-30|website=John Mark|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n=== The CoI that developed Linux ===\nTraditionally, the company is the most efficient means of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement, and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms boundaries.<ref name=\"Lee and Cole (2003)\">Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.</ref> To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how \"thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]]\": the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is a value system, recognition, and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], the knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, \"the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,\" even across firms' boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|Coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.\n\n== Benefits and disadvantages of communities of innovation ==\nAccording to Henry Chesbrough, over the twentieth century, the closed innovation paradigm was overtaken by the theory of open innovation, which emphasizes the significantly higher importance of external resources<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}} thanks to an increasing trend towards globalization, new market participants, and simultaneously shorter product life cycles with correspondingly increasing R&D costs.\n\nInnovation through CoIs has many benefits when compared to proprietary or closed-off product development. Particularly, individual innovators and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to gain most from open innovation collaborations due to their inherently limited capabilities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sungjoo|first=Lee|last2=Gwangman|first2=Park|last3=Byungun|first3=Yoon|last4=Park|first4=Jinwoo|date=March 2010|title=Open innovation in SMEs: An intermediated network model|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733309002248|journal=Research Policy|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the most popular Open Source tools and applications{{snd}} developed through collaboration among their respective communities of innovation (such as software like Linux, Apache Web Server, PostgresSQL and PHP) were compared with similar proprietary software, Gartner<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/en|title=Gartner: Fueling the Future of Business|website=Gartner|language=en|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> found that open source bested or equaled the quality of their proprietary cousins and that many open source developers and advocates are gainfully employed and at very little risk of losing future work prospects. Open source products development has proven to be an efficient way of exhibiting skills.\n\nAccording to the Technology and Innovation Management Review, open innovation generally provides the following benefits: Broader base of ideas, Technological synergy, Improvement of the internal learning capacity through the transfer of external knowledge and learning routines and Use of intellectual property as strategic assets.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Ullrich|first=Andr\u00e9|last2=Vladova|first2=Gergana|date=2016|title=Weighing the Pros and Cons of Engaging in Open Innovation|journal=Technology Innovation Management Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=34\u201340|issn=1927-0321|doi=10.22215/timreview/980}}</ref>\n\nHowever, open innovation is also associated with a slow or delayed development Pace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology|last=Chesbrough|first=Henry|publisher=Boston: Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAlso, over time it has been proven{{snd}} especially in the case of communities of innovation in the software industry{{snd}} that due to the nature of patent and intellectual property law, the dream of open source software as advanced by its advocates{{snd}} has failed. It was believed that democratization of software would result in shared ownership of its intellectual property, but that hasn't happened. Software built using open source software{{snd}} is then patented and closed to external collaboration by wealthy companies, who profit much more from the results than the communities of innovation involved in developing the underlying technologies. This leads to greater wealth inequality, as opposed to social good.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|last2=Boettiger|first2=Sara|date=2005-01-08|title=Open Source Patenting|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=645182}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an article in ''Technology and Innovation Management Review'', open innovation generally suffers from the following disadvantages: strong dependence on external knowledge; loss of key knowledge control; loss of flexibility, creativity, and strategic power.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== History ==\nThere is evidence that, contrary to the popular belief, communities of innovation such as those in [[open source software]], are not a recent development.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are many examples in history in which innovators have used collective invention as in the cases of textile machinery, steam engines, and the production of iron and steel. In these cases, the innovators' behavior was largely dependent on public policy that accommodated knowledge sharing to foster cumulative innovation. Sometimes, knowledge sharing coexisted with [[patent]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite the historical precedent, today knowledge sharing among innovators is generally regarded as a modern development. The cost for information exchange has drastically decreased due, in a large part, to breakthroughs within the information and communication fields. According to Henry Chesborough (2003),<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> modern open innovation is often seen as, \"a sharp break from the paradigm of the early twentieth century when research labs were largely self sufficient{{snd}} only occasionally receiving outside visitors, and researchers would seldom venture out to visit universities or scientific expositions\". In history, the \"heroic inventor\" is shown greater consideration than the cooperation of innovators.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStories of innovative heroes were believed to be more fascinating than other narratives, such as the stories of often nameless farmers, who created and shared new types of wheat on the [[Great Plains]]. This demonstrates the cultural shift that caused the \"heroic inventor\" to be nationally celebrated in Britain and all Western countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nKnowledge sharing often occurred in the past, though there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not it occurs more frequently today. However, it is known that tension has existed for some time between the depth and scope of open knowledge sharing and the patent system.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmong the foremost examples of collective innovation in the past is Cleveland's Pig Iron industry in the UK during 1850\u20131870. This industry experienced a \"free exchange of information about new techniques and plant designs among firms in an industry\".<ref name=\":0\" /> According to economic historian Robert Allen, the proliferation of knowledge sharing in the iron district had two plausible reasons.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Robert|date=March 1983|title=Collective invention|url=|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(83)90023-9|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization|volume=4|pages=1\u201324}}</ref> First, afterword traveled of a prosperous blast furnace design, the reputations of engineers grew to be more positive. This only increased profits and allowed engineers to improve their careers. Second, such disclosures could cause the value of the revealing party's assets to decrease. Improving the blast furnace designs, in turn, led to an increase in the values of iron ore deposits, because these Cleveland ore mines were often owned by the blast furnace firms. This possibly made revealing technical information freely a profitable activity from the individual firm's point of view.<ref name=\":1\" /> Similarities can be drawn to today's communities of innovation, where the primary motivation for participants is recognition and potential career advancement, and for participating firms is related profit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt is yet to be understood how the rivalry between firms and innovators (that caused knowledge sharing to exist) came to be, while which conditions actually lead to aggressive rivalry and patenting. Bessen and Nuvolari (2011) mention that \"...&nbsp;as the technology matures, the nature of firms rivalry, their willingness to share knowledge and their use of patents correspondingly change. In particular, knowledge sharing is more likely to occur during the early phases of technology or where local innovation has little effect on worldwide prices.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Tacit knowledge]]\n* [[Online participation]]\n* [[Social capital]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/innovation/communication.htm \"Communication on Innovation policy: updating the Union's approach in the context of the Lisbon strategy\"].
