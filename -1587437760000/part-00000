The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point?

Gus shuts down lab construction because of Lalo's suspicions and Mike sends Werner's crew home. Upset over Gus' lack of compassion for Werner, Mike refuses to accept payment during the downtime. Saul's camera crew helps generate publicity for his practice by faking a confrontation with Deputy District Attorney Oakley. Kim's client refuses a favorable plea bargain.

Two drug users who received Saul's 50% off business card go on a multi-day binge. As they attempt to buy more cocaine at the Salamanca drug house, the bags get stuck in the drainpipe. Domingo\u2019s attempt to solve the problem causes the drugs to fall out just as police arrive.

Nacho tries to have someone purchase his father's upholstery shop so his father can retire safely away from the drug world, but his father sees through the ruse.

The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point? Because situations may require him to do things and turn a blind eye to things that Jimmy McGill would not be able to stomach.<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\">{{Cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |title='Better Call Saul' creator on what lies ahead in season 5&nbsp;\u2013 and the return of Gene |date=December 12, 2018 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=December 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213021058/https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |archive-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nMain cast members [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] return from previous seasons as Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman, [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], [[Kim Wexler]],<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Howard Hamlin]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |title='Better Call Saul' star Patrick Fabian on the evolution of Howard, his soft spot for Rhea Seehorn and what to expect from season 5 |last=Pai |first=Akshay |date=November 13, 2018 |website=Meaww |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224034537/https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Nacho Varga]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |title=Michael Mando Is Living a Real Life Hollywood Fairy Tale |last=Scott |first=Savannah |date=December 11, 2018 |website=L'Officiel |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224033938/https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gus Fring]].<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Tony Dalton]], who recurred in season four as [[Lalo Salamanca]], was promoted to the main cast for the fifth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |title='Better Call Saul' Adds Tony Dalton As Series Regular For Season 5 |last=Ramos |first=Dino-Ray |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409061114/https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, it was announced that ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' actors [[Dean Norris]] and [[Steven Michael Quezada]] would reprise their roles as [[Hank Schrader]] and [[Steven Gomez]], along with actor [[Robert Forster]] who appeared posthumously as [[Ed Galbraith]].<ref name=\"BBCharacters\">{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |title='Better Call Saul' season 5 to feature the late Robert Forster, Dean Norris |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=January 16, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117041936/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |archive-date=January 17, 2020 |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> The first episode of the season was dedicated to Forster.<ref name=\"sepinwall\">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-1-magic-man-954059/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season Premiere Recap: \u2018Magic Man\u2019 |date=February 23, 2020 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 23, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fifth season began on April 10, 2019, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |title='Better Call Saul' begins filming season 5 in ABQ |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190414143824/https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/04/09/better-call-saul-season-5-amc-confirms-filming-this-week-patrick-fabian-briefly-talks-howard/ |title='Better Call Saul' Season 5: AMC Confirms Filming Begins This Week;

Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the settlement, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim\u2019s insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo was inspired by a photograph the bank never obtained permission to use. Jimmy pressures Kevin by threatening an injunction against displaying the logo and TV ads seeking plaintiffs for class action suits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets privately with Jimmy and accepts a deal to pay Acker and the photographer. Kim angrily confronts Jimmy, upset that he made her the \"sucker\" for his con.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock.

This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.
