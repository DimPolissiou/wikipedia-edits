The incident has since become legendary.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}</ref>\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[K\u014dzuke Province|K\u014dzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''r\u014dnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should display in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, during which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as ''[[Ch\u016bshingura]]''. The story was popularized in numerous plays, including in the genres of ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some,{{who|date=March 2014}} the first ''Ch\u016bshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' survive.\n\nThe ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years after the events in question in the late 18th century when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.<ref name=\"s91\">Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan'', p. 91.</ref> To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''r\u014dnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\n==Name==\nThe event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Ak\u014d incident''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Ak\u014d vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Ak\u014d-r\u014dshi|\u8d64\u7a42\u6d6a\u58eb}} or {{nihongo|Shi-j\u016b-shichi-shi|\u56db\u5341\u4e03\u58eb}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"forty-seven r\u014dnin\" or \"forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Ch\u016bshingura''|\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.\n\n==Story==\nFor many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven r\u014dnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.<ref name=smith1>[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University</ref> Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.<ref name=smith1/>\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\n{{quote |In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the forty-seven r\u00f4nin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, ''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe''. | Mitford, A. B.<ref>(1871). ''Tales of Old Japan,'' pp. 5\u20136.</ref> [emphasis added]}}\n\nMitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \"proofs\" authenticating the factual basis of his story.<ref>Mitford, pp. 28\u201334.</ref> These documents were:\n# ...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira K\u014dtsuk\u0113 no Suk\u0113's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\">Mitford, p. 30.</ref>\n# ...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men, dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.<ref>Mitford, p. 31.</ref>\n# ...a paper which the Forty-seven R\u014dnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira K\u00f4tsuk\u00e9 no Suk\u00e9.<ref>Mitford, p. 32.</ref>\n\n(See ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.)\n\n===Genesis of a tragedy===\n[[File:Chushingura Matsu no Oroka.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' of Edo Castle]]\n[[File:MatsuNoORoka.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' (Great Corridor of Pines) in [[Edo Castle]], where Asano attacked Kira]]\nIn 1701, two ''[[daimy\u014d]]'', [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]], the young ''daimy\u014d'' of the [[Ak\u014d Domain]] (a small [[fiefdom]] in western [[Honsh\u016b]]), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the [[Tsuwano Domain]], were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of [[Emperor Higashiyama|the Emperor]] at [[Edo Castle]], during their ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' service to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''.<ref>Mitford, A. B. (1871). ''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.</ref>\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,<ref>Mitford, p. 7.</ref> offence was taken.<ref name = \"s91\" />\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.<ref>Mitford, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (\u767d\u66f8\u9662) and the ''\u014chiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (\u672c\u4e38\u5fa1\u6bbf) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.<ref>Mitford, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].<ref>Mitford, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> The ''daimy\u014d'' of Ak\u014d had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.<ref name = \"s91\" /> Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to [[\u014cishi Yoshio|\u014cishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\n===The ''r\u014dnin'' plot revenge===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the r\u014dnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an [[\u014dtsuchi]].]]\nOf Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader \u014cishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''r\u014dnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\n\u014cishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as \u014cishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&mdash;that he abused and insulted \u014cishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, \u014cishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''r\u014dnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\n\u014cishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. \u014cishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid \u014cishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful ''r\u014dnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to \u014cishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\n===The attack===\n[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]\n[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''r\u014dnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]\nAfter two years, when \u014cishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,<ref>Mitford, p. 16.</ref> and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15,  (1702) 14 December|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u56db\u65e5|}},<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\">[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, \u014cishi and the other ''r\u014dnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by \u014cishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, \u014cishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.<ref>Mitford, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.<ref>Mitford, p. 17</ref> All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which \u014cishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.<ref>Mitford, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.<ref>Mitford, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''r\u014dnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], \u6575\u8a0e\u3061). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.<ref>Mitford, p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, \u014cishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but \u014cishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.<ref>Mitford, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.<ref>Mitford, p. 20.</ref>\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''r\u014dnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but \u014cishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.<ref>Mitford, p. 22.</ref>\n\n===The death of Kira===\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.<ref>Mitford, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''r\u014dnin'' gathered, and \u014cishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira\u2014as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.<ref>Mitford, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nAt that, \u014cishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. \u014cishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.<ref>Mitford, p. 24.</ref>\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling.

They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimy\u014d''.<ref>Mitford, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, two of Kira's friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\"/>\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''sh\u014dgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''r\u014dnin''. As expected, the ''r\u014dnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''sh\u014dgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\">Mitford, p. 28.</ref> It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.<ref name = \"s91\" /> \u014cishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.\n\nEach of the 46 ''r\u014dnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u516d\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u56db\u65e5||February 4, 1703}}.<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\"/> This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six r\u014dnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''sh\u014dgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''r\u014dnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''sh\u014dgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades.

Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the ''r\u014dnin'' had been sentenced to their honorable end.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAsano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Honjomatsuzakacho park entrance ryogoku sumida 2009.JPG|thumb|Part of the Remains of Former Kira Residence, currently Honjo Matsuzaka-cho Park]]\n\n===Members===\nBelow are the names of the 47 ''r\u014dnin'' in the following form: family name - pseudonym (''[[kemy\u014d]]'') - real name (''[[imina]]'').

It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards\u2014bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''r\u014dnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''r\u014dnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time\u2014but this was unimportant.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\">[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n{{Main|Ch\u016bshingura}}\n[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[\u014cishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]\nThe tragedy of the forty-seven r\u014dnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''r\u014dnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\n===Plays===\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Ch\u016bshingura'', or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[K\u014d no Moronao]] and \u014cishi became \u014cboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''r\u014dnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''r\u014dnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\n===Opera===\nThe story was turned into an opera, ''Ch\u016bshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,<ref name=\"child2007\">Child, Ben.

It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Ch\u016bshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' (\"historical drama\") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Ch\u016bshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | newspaper = Chicago Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Ch\u016bshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.<ref name=\"child2007\"/> In it, [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daich\u016bshingura]]'' as \u014cishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Ak\u014d-j\u014d danzetsu'').\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daich\u016bshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ry\u014dran'', recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Ch\u016bshingura'', while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, ''[[gaiden]]'' dramatize events and characters not in the ''Ch\u016bshingura''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed [[47 Ronin (1994 film)|another version]] in 1994. In 2004, [[K\u014dsei Sait\u014d|Mitsumasa Sait\u014d]] directed a nine-episode mini-series starring [[Ken Matsudaira]], who had also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' entitled ''Genroku Ry\u014dran''. In [[Hirokazu Koreeda]]'s 2006 film ''[[Hana (film)|Hana yori mo nao]]'', the story was used as a backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.\n\nMost recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie titled ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]'', starring [[Keanu Reeves]], and then again into a more stylized 2015 version titled ''[[Last Knights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/01/freeman-owen-casualties-of-bloody-bad-last-knights/|title=Freeman, Owen casualties of bloody bad 'Last Knights'|first=Sara|last=Stewart|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Woodblock prints===\nThe forty-seven r\u014dnin is one of the most popular themes in [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], or ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors.

incident'''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}} or ''Ak\u014d vendetta'', is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless [[samurai]]) avenged the death of their master. The incident has since become legendary.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}</ref>\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[K\u014dzuke Province|K\u014dzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''r\u014dnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as ''[[Ch\u016bshingura]]''. The story was popularized in numerous plays, including in the genres of ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some,{{who|date=March 2014}} the first ''Ch\u016bshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' survive.\n\nThe ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.<ref name=\"s91\">Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan'', p. 91.</ref> To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''r\u014dnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\n==Name==\nThe event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Ak\u014d incident''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Ak\u014d vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Ak\u014d-r\u014dshi|\u8d64\u7a42\u6d6a\u58eb}} or {{nihongo|Shi-j\u016b-shichi-shi|\u56db\u5341\u4e03\u58eb}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"forty-seven r\u014dnin\" or \"forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Ch\u016bshingura''|\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.\n\n==Story==\nFor many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven r\u014dnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.<ref name=smith1>[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University</ref> Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.<ref name=smith1/>\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\n{{quote |In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the forty-seven r\u00f4nin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, ''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe''. | Mitford, A. B.<ref>(1871). ''Tales of Old Japan,'' pp. 5\u20136.</ref> [emphasis added]}}\n\nMitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \"proofs\" authenticating the factual basis of his story.<ref>Mitford, pp. 28\u201334.</ref> These documents were:\n# ...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira K\u00f4tsuk\u00e9 no Suk\u00e9's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\">Mitford, p. 30.</ref>\n# ...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men, dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.<ref>Mitford, p. 31.</ref>\n# ...a paper which the Forty-seven R\u01d2nin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira K\u00f4tsuk\u00e9 no Suk\u00e9.<ref>Mitford, p. 32.</ref>\n\n(See ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.)\n\n===Genesis of a tragedy===\n[[File:Chushingura Matsu no Oroka.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' of Edo Castle]]\n[[File:MatsuNoORoka.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' (Great Corridor of Pines) in [[Edo Castle]], where Asano attacked Kira]]\nIn 1701, two ''[[daimy\u014d]]'', [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]], the young ''daimy\u014d'' of the [[Ak\u014d Domain]] (a small [[fiefdom]] in western [[Honsh\u016b]]), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the [[Tsuwano Domain]], were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of [[Emperor Higashiyama|the Emperor]] at [[Edo Castle]], during their ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' service to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''.<ref>Mitford, A. B. (1871). ''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.</ref>\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,<ref>Mitford, p. 7.</ref> offence was taken.<ref name = \"s91\" />\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.<ref>Mitford, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (\u767d\u66f8\u9662) and the ''\u014chiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (\u672c\u4e38\u5fa1\u6bbf) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.<ref>Mitford, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].<ref>Mitford, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> The ''daimy\u014d'' of Ak\u014d had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.<ref name = \"s91\" /> Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to [[\u014cishi Yoshio|\u014cishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\n===The ''r\u014dnin'' plot revenge===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the r\u014dnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an [[\u014dtsuchi]].]]\nOf Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader \u014cishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''r\u014dnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\n\u014cishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as \u014cishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&mdash;that he abused and insulted \u014cishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, \u014cishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''r\u014dnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\n\u014cishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. \u014cishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid \u014cishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful ''r\u014dnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to \u014cishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\n===The attack===\n[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]\n[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''r\u014dnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]\nAfter two years, when \u014cishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,<ref>Mitford, p. 16.</ref> and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15,  (1702) 14 December|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u56db\u65e5|}},<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\">[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, \u014cishi and the other ''r\u014dnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by \u014cishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, \u014cishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.<ref>Mitford, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.<ref>Mitford, p. 17</ref> All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which \u014cishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.<ref>Mitford, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.<ref>Mitford, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''r\u014dnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], \u6575\u8a0e\u3061). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.<ref>Mitford, p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, \u014cishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but \u014cishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.<ref>Mitford, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.<ref>Mitford, p. 20.</ref>\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''r\u014dnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but \u014cishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.<ref>Mitford, p. 22.</ref>\n\n===The death of Kira===\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.<ref>Mitford, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''r\u014dnin'' gathered, and \u014cishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira\u2014as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.<ref>Mitford, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nAt that, \u014cishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. \u014cishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.<ref>Mitford, p. 24.</ref>\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, \u014cishi ordered the other ''r\u014dnin'' to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.\n\nThey then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.<ref>Mitford, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nOne of the ''r\u014dnin'', the ''[[ashigaru]]'' Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Ak\u014d and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the ''r\u014dnin'' turned themselves in.)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry D.

The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.<ref>Mitford, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\nOn arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 ''r\u014dnin'' (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimy\u014d''.<ref>Mitford, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, two of Kira's friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\"/>\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''sh\u014dgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''r\u014dnin''. As expected, the ''r\u014dnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''sh\u014dgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\">Mitford, p. 28.</ref> It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.<ref name = \"s91\" /> \u014cishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.\n\nEach of the 46 ''r\u014dnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u516d\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u56db\u65e5||February 4, 1703}}.<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\"/> This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six r\u014dnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''sh\u014dgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''r\u014dnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''sh\u014dgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades.

The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.<ref name = \"s91\" /> One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on \u014cishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that \u014cishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the ''r\u014dnin''.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\" />\n\n===Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship===\nThough the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the ''r\u014dnin'' had been sentenced to their honorable end.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAsano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Honjomatsuzakacho park entrance ryogoku sumida 2009.JPG|thumb|Part of the Remains of Former Kira Residence, currently Honjo Matsuzaka-cho Park]]\n\n===Members===\nBelow are the names of the 47 ''r\u014dnin'' in the following form: family name - pseudonym (''[[kemy\u014d]]'') - real name (''[[imina]]'').

It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards\u2014bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''r\u014dnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''r\u014dnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time\u2014but this was unimportant.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\">[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n{{Main|Ch\u016bshingura}}\n[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[\u014cishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]\nThe tragedy of the forty-seven r\u014dnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''r\u014dnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\n===Plays===\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Ch\u016bshingura'', or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[K\u014d no Moronao]] and \u014cishi became \u014cboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''r\u014dnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''r\u014dnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\n===Opera===\nThe story was turned into an opera, ''Ch\u016bshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,<ref name=\"child2007\">Child, Ben.

It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Ch\u016bshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' (\"historical drama\") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Ch\u016bshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | newspaper = Chicago Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Ch\u016bshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.<ref name=\"child2007\"/> In it, [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daich\u016bshingura]]'' as \u014cishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Ak\u014d-j\u014d danzetsu'').\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daich\u016bshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ry\u014dran'', recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Ch\u016bshingura'', while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details.

His other best-known compositions are ''[[Finlandia]]'', the ''[[Karelia Suite]]'', ''[[Valse triste (Sibelius)|Valse triste]]'', the [[Violin Concerto (Sibelius)|Violin Concerto]], the choral symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]'', and ''[[The Swan of Tuonela]]'' (from the ''[[Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite]]'').

He was the son of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius n\u00e9e Borg. The family name stems from the Sibbe estate in [[Eastern Uusimaa]], which his paternal great-grandfather owned.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=8}} Sibelius's father died of [[typhoid]] in July 1868, leaving substantial debts. As a result, his mother\u2014who was again pregnant\u2014had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in H\u00e4meenlinna.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=19}} Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin. It was he who gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=905}} For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but acted as a musical adviser.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}}\n\nFrom an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to [[Loviisa]] on the coast for the summer months. In his own words: \"For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness. H\u00e4meenlinna was where I went to school; Loviisa was freedom.\" It was in H\u00e4meenlinna, when he was seven, that his aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family's upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note. He progressed by improvising on his own, but still learned to read music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=4}} He later turned to the violin, which he preferred. He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda on piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello. ([[Christian Sibelius]] was to become an eminent [[psychiatrist]], still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland.)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibelius |language=Swedish |year=1926 |publisher=Nordisk Familjebok |url=http://runeberg.org/nfcr/0165.html |accessdate=11 June 2015 |p=281}}</ref> Furthermore, Sibelius often played in quartets with neighboring families, adding to his experience in chamber music. Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a ''Suite in D Minor'' for violin and piano.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|pp=10\u201313}} Around 1881, he recorded on paper his short [[pizzicato]] piece ''Vattendroppar'' (Water Drops) for violin and cello, although it might just have been a musical exercise.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Music becomes a serious pursuit 1881\u20131885 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_musiikkiharrastus.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> The first reference he to himself composing is in a letter from August 1883 in which he writes that he composed a trio and was working on another: \"They are rather poor, but it is nice to have something to do on rainy days.\"<ref name=\"childhood\"/> In 1881, he started to take violin lessons from the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=6}} Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon succeeded in becoming quite an accomplished player, performing [[Ferdinand David (musician)|David]]'s Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto]] in Helsinki. Despite such success as an instrumentalist, he ultimately chose to become a composer.{{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=67}}<ref name=\"sih\"/>\n\nAlthough his mother tongue was Swedish, in 1874 Sibelius attended Lucina Hagman's Finnish-speaking preparatory school. In 1876, he was then able to continue his education at the Finnish-language [[H\u00e4meenlinna Normal-Lyc\u00e9e|H\u00e4meenlinna Normal Lyceum]] where he was a rather absent-minded pupil, although he did quite well in mathematics and botany.<ref name=\"childhood\">{{cite web |title=Childhood 1865\u20131881 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/ |accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref> Despite having to repeat a year, he passed the school's final examination in 1885, which allowed him to enter a university.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=14}} As a boy he was known as [[Janne]], a colloquial form of Johan. However, during his student years, he adopted the French form [[Jean (male given name)|Jean]], inspired by the business card of his deceased seafaring uncle. Thereafter he became known as Jean Sibelius.{{sfn|Ekman|1972|p=11}}\n\n===Studies and early career===\n[[File:Martin Wegelius.gif|thumb|left|[[Martin Wegelius]], Sibelius's teacher in Finland]]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1885, Sibelius began to study law at the [[University of Helsinki|Imperial Alexander University in Finland]] but, showing far more interest in music, soon moved to the Helsinki Music Institute (now the [[Sibelius Academy]]) where he studied from 1885 to 1889. One of his teachers was its founder, Martin Wegelius, who did much to support the development of education in Finland. It was he who gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=75}} Another important influence was his teacher [[Ferruccio Busoni]], a pianist-composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}} His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer [[Adolf Paul]] and the conductor-to-be [[Armas J\u00e4rnefelt]], (who introduced him to his influential family including his sister [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]] who would become Sibelius's wife).{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}} The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of [[Grieg]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=62}}\n\nSibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with [[Albert Becker (composer)|Albert Becker]], and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with [[Robert Fuchs]] and Hungarian-Jewish [[Karl Goldmark]]. In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]''. He also heard the Finnish composer [[Robert Kajanus]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in a program that included his symphonic poem ''Aino'', a patriotic piece that may have triggered Sibelius's later interest in using the epic poem ''Kalevala'' as a basis for his own compositions.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Kalevala taiteessa \u2013 Musiikissa: Ensimm\u00e4iset Kalevala-aiheiset s\u00e4vellykset |language=Finnish |publisher=Kalevalan Kultuuruhistoria |url=http://www.kalevalaseura.fi/kaku/sivu.php?n=p1a1&s=p1a1s1&h=hp1a1&f=fp1s |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> While in Vienna, he became particularly interested in the music of [[Anton Bruckner]] whom, for a time, he regarded as \"the greatest living composer\", although he continued to show interest in the established works of [[Beethoven]] and [[Wagner]]. He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends. It was also in Vienna that he turned to orchestral composition, working on an Overture in E major and a ''Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet''. While embarking on ''Kullervo'', an orchestral work inspired by the ''Kalevala'', he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone- excision surgery.<ref>{{cite web |title=Studies in Vienna 1890\u201391 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_opinnot_wien.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Shortly after returning to Helsinki, Sibelius thoroughly enjoyed conducting his Overture and the ''Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet'' at a popular concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kullervo and the wedding 1891\u20131892 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kullervo.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> He was also able to continue working on ''Kullervo'', now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things Finnish. Premiered in Helsinki on 28 April 1892, the work was an enormous success.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}}\n\n[[File:Sibelius 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|Sibelius in 1891]]\n\nIt was around this time that Sibelius finally abandoned his cherished aspirations as a violinist:\n<blockquote>My tragedy was that I wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink \u2014 unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.{{sfn|Kaufman|1938|p=218}}</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin (1889\u201391), in 1900 he travelled to Italy where he spent a year with his family. He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, the UK, France and Germany and later travelled to the United States.{{sfn|Goss|2011|p=162}}\n\n===Marriage and rise to fame===\nWhile Sibelius was studying music in Helsinki in the autumn of 1888, Armas J\u00e4rnefelt, a friend from the Music Institute, invited him to the family home. There he met and immediately fell in love with [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]], the 17-year-old daughter of General [[Alexander J\u00e4rnefelt]], the governor of [[Vaasa]], and [[Elisabeth J\u00e4rnefelt|Elisabeth Clodt von J\u00fcrgensburg]], a Baltic aristocrat.<ref name=\"sih\">{{cite web |title=Studies in Helsinki 1885\u20131888 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_opinnot_helsinki.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> The wedding was held on 10 June 1892 at [[Maxmo]].

It was described by the composer {{Interlanguage link multi|Aksel T\u00f6rnudd|fi}} as \"a volcanic eruption\" while Juho Ranta who sang in the choir stated, \"It was ''Finnish'' music.\"{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=74}} At the end of that year the composer's grandmother, Katarina Borg died. Sibelius went to her funeral, visiting his H\u00e4meenlinna home one last time before the house was sold. On 16 February 1893, the first (extended) version of ''En saga'' was presented in Helsinki although it was not too well received, the critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated (as they were in Sibelius's 1902 version). Even less successful were three more performances of ''Kullervo'' in March, which one critic found was incomprehensible and lacking in vitality. Following the birth of Sibelius's first child Eva, in April the premiere of his choral work ''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's Boat Ride'' was a considerable success, receiving the support of the press.<ref name=\"symposion\">{{cite web |title=The Symposion years 1892\u20131897 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_symbosion.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November 1893, the full version of ''Karelia'' was premiered at a student association gala at the Seurahuone in [[Viipuri Province|Viipuri]] with the collaboration of the artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela|Axel Gall\u00e9n]] and the sculptor [[Emil Wikstr\u00f6m]] who had been brought in to design the stage sets. While the first performance was difficult to appreciate over the background noise of the talkative audience, a second performance on 18 November was more successful. Furthermore, on the 19th and 23rd Sibelius presented an extended suite of the work in Helsinki, conducting the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=85}} Sibelius's music was increasingly presented in Helsinki's concert halls. In the 1894\u201395 season, works such as ''En saga'', ''Karelia'' and ''[[Spring Song (Sibelius)|V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng]]'' (composed in 1894) were included in at least 16 concerts in the capital, not to mention those in [[Turku]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=162}} When performed in a revised version on 17 April 1895, the composer [[Oskar Merikanto]] welcomed ''V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng'' (Spring Song) as \"the fairest flower among Sibelius's orchestral pieces\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibelius: Spring Song (original 1894) |publisher=ClassicLive |url=http://www.classiclive.com/sibelius-spring-song-original-1984 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gallen-Kallela Symposium.jpg|thumb|Sibelius (right) socializing with Akseli Gallen-Kallela (the artist, left), Oskar Merikanto and Robert Kajanus]]\nFor a considerable period, Sibelius worked on an opera, ''[[Veneen luominen]]'' (The Building of the Boat), again based on the ''Kalevala''. To some extent, he had come under the influence of Wagner, but subsequently turned to [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration. Adapted from material for the opera, which he never completed, his ''Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite'' consisted of four legends in the form of tone poems.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}} They were premiered in Helsinki on 13 April 1896 to a full house. In contrast to Merikanto's enthusiasm for the Finnish quality of the work, the critic Karl Flodin found the cor anglais solo in ''The Swan of Tuonela'' \"stupendously long and boring\",{{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=101}}<ref name=\"symposion\"/> although he considered the first legend, ''Lemmink\u00e4inen and the Maidens of the Island'', as representing the peak of Sibelius's achievement to date.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=166}}\n\nTo pay his way, from 1892 Sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at the Music Institute and at Kajanus's conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=988}} The situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant, initially for ten years and later extended for life. He was able to complete [[King Christian II (Sibelius)|the music]] for Adolf Paul's play ''King Christian II''. Performed on 24 February 1898, its catchy tunes appealed to the public. The scores of four popular pieces from the play were published in Germany and sold well in Finland. When the orchestral suite was successfully performed in Helsinki in November 1898, Sibelius commented: \"The music sounded excellent and the tempi seem to be right. I think this is the first time that I have managed to make something complete.\" The work was also performed in Stockholm and Leipzig.<ref name=\"tib\">{{cite web |title=Towards an international breakthrough 1897\u20131899 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kohti_lapimurtoa.htm |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1899, Sibelius embarked on his [[Symphony No. 1 (Sibelius)|First Symphony]] at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by the Russian emperor [[Nicholas II]]'s attempt to [[Russification of Finland|restrict the powers of the Grand Duchy of Finland]].<ref name=club/> The symphony was well received by all when it was premiered in Helsinki on 26 April 1899.

Nevertheless, in the spring Sibelius went on an international tour with Kajanus and his orchestra, presenting his recent works (including a revised version of his First Symphony) in thirteen cities including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin and Paris.

It was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in Helsinki on 8 March. The work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by the Finns. Merikanto felt it exceeded \"even the boldest expectations,\" while Evert Katila qualified it as \"an absolute masterpiece\".<ref name=\"cdib\"/> Flodin, too, wrote of a symphonic composition \"the likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before\".{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=71}}\n\nSibelius spent the summer in Tv\u00e4rminne near [[Hanko]], where he worked on the song ''Var det en dr\u00f6m'' (Was it a Dream) as well as on a new version of ''En saga''. When it was performed in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1902, it served to firmly establish the composer's reputation in Germany, leading shortly afterwards to the publication of his First Symphony.<ref name=\"cdib\"/>\n\nIn 1903, Sibelius spent much of his time in Helsinki where he indulged excessively in wining and dining, running up considerable bills in the restaurants. But he continued to compose, one of his major successes being ''Valse triste'', one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law [[Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt]]'s play ''[[Kuolema]]'' (Death). Short of money, he sold the piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in Finland but internationally. During his long stays in Helsinki, Sibelius's wife Aino frequently wrote to him, imploring him to return home but to no avail. Even after their fourth daughter, Katarina, was born, he continued to work away from home. Early in 1904, he finished his Violin Concerto but its first public performance on 8 February was not a success.

While the concert itself was successful, it received mixed reviews, some very positive while those in the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' were less enthusiastic. Back in Finland, he rewrote the increasingly popular ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Sibelius)|Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande]]'' as an orchestral suite. In November, visiting Britain for the first time, he went to [[Liverpool]] where he met [[Henry Wood]]. On 2 December, he conducted the First Symphony and ''Finlandia'', writing to Aino that the concert had been a great success and widely acclaimed.<ref name=fya>{{cite web |title=The first years in Ainola 1904\u20131908 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_ainola.htm |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, after a short, rather uneventful stay in Paris at the beginning of the year, Sibelius spent several months composing in Ainola, his major work of the period being ''[[Pohjola's Daughter]]'', yet another piece based on the ''Kalevala''. Later in the year he composed incidental music for ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Sibelius)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', also adapting it as an orchestral suite. He ended the year conducting a series of concerts, the most successful being the first public performance of ''Pohjola's Daughter'' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in St Petersburg.<ref name=fya/>\n\n===Ups and downs===\nFrom the beginning of 1907, Sibelius again indulged in excessive wining and dining in Helsinki, spending exorbitant amounts on champagne and lobster. His lifestyle had a disastrous effect on the health of Aino who was driven to retire to a sanatorium, suffering from exhaustion. While she was away, Sibelius resolved to give up drinking, concentrating instead on composing his [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]]. He completed the work for a performance in Helsinki on 25 September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classiclive.com/Sibelius-Symphony-No3|title=Sibelius: Symphony No. 3|date=15 September 2014|via=www.classiclive.com}}</ref> Although its more classical approach surprised the audience, Flodin commented that it was \"internally new and revolutionary\".<ref name=fya/>\n\nShortly afterwards Sibelius met [[Gustav Mahler]] who was in Helsinki. The two agreed that with each new symphony, they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works. This was demonstrated above all in St Petersburg where the Third Symphony was performed in November 1907 to dismissive reviews. Its reception in Moscow was rather more positive.<ref name=fya/>\n\n[[File:Jean Sibelius 15 Gloucester Walk blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 15 Gloucester Walk, [[Kensington]], London, his home in 1909]]\nIn 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat cancer.\nEarly in 1908, Sibelius had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius's health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all.<ref name=fya/> The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including ''[[Luonnotar (Sibelius)|Luonnotar]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]].{{sfn|Woodstra|2005|pp=1279\u20131282}}\n\n===More pleasant times===\n[[File:Finlandia premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition.gif|thumb|Finlandia (first edition)]]\n\nIn 1909, the successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between Sibelius and Aino in the family home. In Britain too, his condition was well received as he conducted ''En saga'', ''Finlandia'', ''Valse Triste'' and ''Spring Song'' to enthusiastic audiences. A meeting with [[Claude Debussy]] produced further support. After another uneventful trip to Paris, he went to Berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful.<ref name=iv>{{cite web |title=Inner voices 1908\u20131914 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_sisaisia_aania.htm |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius started work on his Fourth Symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs. In October, he conducted concerts in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo) where ''[[The Dryad (Sibelius)|The Dryad]]'' and ''[[In Memoriam (Sibelius)|In Memoriam]]'' were first performed. His ''Valse triste'' and Second Symphony were particularly well received. He then travelled to Berlin to continue work on his Fourth Symphony, writing the finale after returning to J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4.<ref name=iv/>\n\nSibelius conducted his first concerts in Sweden in early 1911 when even his Third Symphony was welcomed by the critics. He completed the Fourth Symphony in April but, as he expected, with its introspective style it was not very warmly received when first performed in Helsinki with mixed reviews. Apart from a trip to Paris where he enjoyed a performance of Richard Strauss's ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', the rest of the year was fairly uneventful. In 1912, he completed his short orchestral work ''Sc\u00e8nes historiques II''. It was first performed in March together with the Fourth Symphony. The concert was repeated twice to enthusiastic audiences and critics including Robert Kajanus. The Fourth Symphony was also well received in [[Birmingham]] in September. In March 1913, it was performed in New York but a large section of the audience left the hall between the movements while in October, after a concert conducted by [[Carl Muck]], the ''Boston American'' labelled it \"a sad failure\".<ref name=iv/>\n\nSibelius's first significant composition of 1913 was the tone poem ''[[The Bard (Sibelius)|The Bard]]'', which he conducted in March to a respectful audience in Helsinki. He went on to compose ''Luonnotar'' (Daughter of Nature) for soprano and orchestra. With a text from the ''Kalevala'', it was first performed in Finnish in September 1913 by [[Aino Ackt\u00e9]] (to whom it had been dedicated) at the [[Three Choirs Festival|music festival]] in [[Gloucester]], England.<ref name=iv/><ref>{{cite web |author=Ozorio, Anne |title=Appreciating Sibelius's Luonnotar Op. 70 by Anne Ozorio |publisher=MusicWeb |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/mar07/Luonnotar.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> In early 1914, Sibelius spent a month in Berlin where he was particularly drawn to [[Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg]]. Back in Finland, he began work on ''The Oceanides'', which the American millionaire Carl Stoeckel had commissioned for the [[Norfolk Chamber Music Festival|Norfolk Music Festival]]. After first composing the work in D flat major, Sibelius undertook substantive revisions, presenting a D major version in Norfolk, which was well received, as were ''Finlandia'' and the ''Valse triste''. [[Henry Krehbiel]] considered ''The Oceanides'' one of the most beautiful pieces of sea music ever composed, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that Sibelius's music was the most notable contribution to the music festival. While in America, Sibelius received an honorary doctorate from [[Yale University]] and, almost simultaneously, one from the University of Helsinki where he was represented by Aino.<ref name=iv/>\n\n===First World War years===\nWhile travelling back from the United States, Sibelius heard about the events in [[Sarajevo]] that led to the beginning of the [[First World War]]. Although he was far away from the fighting, his royalties from abroad were interrupted. To make ends meet, he composed smaller works for publication in Finland. In March 1915, he was able to travel to Gothenburg in Sweden where his ''The Oceanides'' was really appreciated. While working on his [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]] in April, he saw 16 swans flying by, inspiring him to write the finale. \"One of the great experiences of my life!\" he commented. Although there was little progress on the symphony during the summer, he was able to complete it by his 50th birthday on 8 December.<ref name=wfs>{{cite web |title=The war and the fifth symphony 1915\u20131919 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viides_sinfonia.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of his birthday, Sibelius conducted the premiere of the Fifth Symphony in the hall of the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]]. Despite high praise from Kajanus, the composer was not satisfied with his work and soon began to revise it. Around this time, Sibelius was running ever deeper into debt. The grand piano he had received as a present was about to be confiscated by the bailiffs when the singer [[Ida Ekman]] paid off a large proportion of his debt after a successful fund-raising campaign.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nA year later, on 8 December 1916, Sibelius presented the revised version of his Fifth Symphony in Turku, combining the first two movements and simplifying the finale. When it was performed a week later in Helsinki, Katila was very favourable but Wasenius frowned on the changes, leading the composer to rewrite it once again.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nFrom the beginning of 1917, Sibelius started drinking again, triggering arguments with Aino. Their relationship improved with the excitement resulting from the start of the [[Russian Revolution]]. By the end of the year, Sibelius had composed his ''[[J\u00e4ger March]]''. The piece proved particularly popular after the Finnish parliament accepted the Senate's declaration of independence from Russia in December 1917. The ''J\u00e4ger March'', first played on 19 January 1918, delighted the Helsinki elite for a short time until the launch of the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 27 January.<ref name=wfs/> Sibelius naturally supported the [[White Guards (Finland)|Whites]], but as a [[tolstoyan]], Aino Sibelius had some sympathies for the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Reds]] too.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}\n\nIn February, the house Ainola was searched twice by the local Red Guard looking for weapons. During the first weeks of the war, some of his acquaintances were killed in the violence, and his brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius, was arrested as he refused to reserve beds for the Red soldiers who had suffered shell shock at the front. Sibelius' friends in Helsinki were now worried about his safety. The composer Robert Kajanus had negotiations with the Red Guard commander-in-chief [[Eero Haapalainen]], who guaranteed Sibelius a safe journey from Ainola to the capital. In 20 February, a group of Red Guard fighters escorted the family to Helsinki. Finally, in 12\u201313 April, the German troops [[Battle of Helsinki|occupied]] the city and the Red period was over. A week later, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] gave a homage concert for the German commander [[R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz]], Sibelius finished off the event by conducting the ''J\u00e4ger March''.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}\n\n===Revived fortunes===\n[[File:Jean Sibelius 1923.gif|thumb|upright|Sibelius in 1923]]\n\nIn early 1919, Sibelius enthusiastically decided to change his image, removing his thinning hair. In June, together with Aino, he visited Copenhagen on his first trip outside Finland since 1915, successfully presenting his Second Symphony. In November he conducted the final version of his Fifth Symphony, receiving repeated ovations from the audience. By the end of the year, he was already working on the Sixth.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nIn 1920, despite a growing tremor in his hands, Sibelius composed the ''Hymn of the Earth'' to a text by the poet [[Eino Leino]] for the Suomen Laulu Choir and orchestrated his ''Valse lyrique'', helped along by drinking wine. On his birthday in December 1920, Sibelius received a donation of 63,000 marks, a substantial sum the tenor {{Interlanguage link multi|W\u00e4in\u00f6 Sola|fi}} had raised from Finnish businesses. Although he used some of the money to reduce his debts, he also spent a week celebrating to excess in Helsinki.<ref name=lmp>{{cite web |title=The last masterpieces 1920\u20131927 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viimeiset.htm |accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius enjoyed a highly successful trip to England in early 1921\u2014conducting several concerts around the country, including the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, ''The Oceanides'', the ever-popular ''Finlandia'', and ''Valse triste''. Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and ''Valse triste'' in Norway. He was beginning to suffer from exhaustion, but the critics remained positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented ''Lemmink\u00e4inen's Return'' and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.<ref name=lmp/>\n\nEarly in 1922, after suffering from headaches Sibelius decided to acquire spectacles although he never wore them for photographs. In July, he was saddened by the death of his brother Christian. In August, he joined the Finnish Freemasons and composed ritual music for them. In February 1923, he premiered his [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Sixth Symphony]]. Evert Katila highly praised it as \"pure idyll.\" Before the year ended he had also conducted concerts in Stockholm and Rome, the first to considerable acclaim, the second to mixed reviews. He then proceeded to Gothenburg where he enjoyed an ecstatic reception despite arriving at the concert hall suffering from over-indulgence in food and drink. Despite continuing to drink, to Aino's dismay, Sibelius managed to complete his Seventh Symphony in early 1924. In March, under the title of ''Fantasia sinfonica'' it received its first public performance in Stockholm where it was a success. It was even more highly appreciated at a series of concerts in Copenhagen in late September. Sibelius was honoured with the Knight Commander's Cross of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].<ref name=lmp/>\n\nHe spent most of the rest of the year resting as his recent spate of activity was straining his heart and nerves. Composing a few small pieces, he relied increasingly on alcohol. In May 1925, his Danish publisher [[Edition Wilhelm Hansen|Wilhelm Hansen]] and the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] invited him to compose incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. He completed the work well in advance of its premiere in March 1926.<ref name=lmp/> It was well received in Copenhagen although Sibelius was not there himself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Incidental music: Sibelius: Music for \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare, op. 109 (1925\u201326) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/nayttamo_myrsky.htm |accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Last major contributions===\n[[File:Sibelius-puolisot kes\u00e4iltana kasvitarhan penkill\u00e4, 1940-1945, (d2005 167 6 101) Suomen valokuvataiteen museo.jpg|thumb|Sibelius and Aino in [[J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4]] (early 1940s)]]\n\nThe year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius's output: after his Seventh Symphony, he produced only a few major works during the rest of his life.

He promised the premiere of this symphony to [[Serge Koussevitzky]] in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under [[Basil Cameron]] was even advertised to the public.

After the raid on Finland by the Soviet Union on 30 November 1939, the Sibelius family returned for good to Ainola in the summer of 1941, after a long absence. Anxious about Bolshevism, Sibelius advocated that Finnish soldiers march alongside the German army against the Soviet Union. Sibelius did not make any utterances about the genocide of the Jews although, in a diary entry in 1943, he wondered why he had signed the Aryan certificate.<ref>Dagbok, p. 336</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1939, Sibelius participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his ''[[Andante Festivo]]''. The performance was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on CD.

His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony ''Kullervo'', which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem ''Kalevala''. His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially ''En saga'', ''The Swan of Tuonela'' and ''Valse triste''.<ref name=alexross>{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=9 July 2007 |title=Sibelius: Apparition from the Woods |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2007/07/sibelius-chapte.html |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> Sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a Violin Concerto, the opera ''Jungfrun i tornet'', many shorter orchestral pieces, chamber music, works for piano and violin, choral works and numerous songs.{{sfn|Poroila|2012}}\n\nIn the mid-1920s, after his Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, he composed the symphonic poem ''Tapiola'' and incidental music for ''The Tempest''. Thereafter, although he lived until 1957, he did not publish any further works of note. For several years, he worked on an Eighth Symphony, which he later burned.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Gramophone |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/composers/jean-sibelius-39924 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs for his musical style, hints of Tchaikovsky's music are particularly evident in early works such as his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=209}} For a period, he was nevertheless overwhelmed by Wagner, particularly while composing his opera. More lasting influences included Ferruccio Busoni and Anton Bruckner. But for his tone poems, he was above all inspired by [[Liszt]].<ref name=\"symposion\"/>{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=102}} The similarities to Bruckner can be seen in the brass contributions to his orchestral works and the generally slow tempo of his music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vkIWs6nvRs8C&pg=PA63 63]}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Kalamidas, Thanos |date=12 August 2009 |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Ovi Magazine |url=http://www.ovimagazine.com/art/5165 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of [[sonata form]] in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger \"themes\" effectively prove the opposite.{{sfn|Pike|1978|page=93}}\n\n[[File:Jean Sibelius by Eero J\u00e4rnefelt 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Sibelius from 1892 by his brother-in-law [[Eero J\u00e4rnefelt]]]]\nThis self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius's primary rival in symphonic composition.{{sfn|Botstein|2011}} While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler's style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together, leading Sibelius to comment:\n<blockquote>I said that I admired [the symphony's] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs&nbsp;... Mahler's opinion was just the reverse. \"No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.\"{{sfn|James|1989|p=41}}</blockquote>\n\n===Symphonies===\n[[File:Robert Kajanus (14854805748).jpg|left|thumb|Robert Kajanus, founder and chief conductor of the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], who was a notable interpreter of Sibelius's symphonies]]\n\nSibelius started work on his Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, in 1898 and completed it in early 1899, when he was 33. The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original, well received version that has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revision was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 18 July 1900.<ref>David Ewen, ''Music for the Millions \u2013 The Encyclopedia of Musical Masterpieces'' (READ Books, 2007) p533</ref> The symphony begins with a highly original, rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani.<ref>{{cite web |title=First symphony op. 39 (1899\u20131900) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_01.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis Second Symphony, the most popular and most frequently recorded of his symphonies, was first performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society on 8 March 1902, with the composer conducting. The opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for the whole work. The heroic theme of the finale with the three-tone motif is interpreted by the trumpets rather than the original woodwinds. During a period of Russian oppression, it consolidated Sibelius's reputation as a national hero. After the first performance, Sibelius made some changes, leading to a revised version first performed by Armas J\u00e4rnefelt on 10 November 1903 in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web |title=Second symphony op. 43 (1902)\n|work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_02.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Third Symphony is a good-natured, triumphal, and deceptively simple-sounding piece. The symphony's first performance was given by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer, on 25 September 1907. There are themes from Finnish folk music in the work's early chords. Composed just after his move to Ainola, it contrasts sharply with the first two symphonies, with its clear mode of expression developing into the marching tones of the finale.<ref name=alexross/><ref>{{cite web |title=Third symphony op. 52 (1907) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_03.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> His Fourth Symphony was premiered in Helsinki on 3 April 1911 by the Philharmonia Society, with Sibelius conducting. It was written while Sibelius was undergoing a series of operations to remove a tumour from his throat. Its grimness can perhaps be explained as a reaction from his (temporary) decision to give up drinking. The opening bars, with cellos, basses and bassoons, convey a new approach to timing. It then develops into melancholic sketches based on the composer's setting of Poe's ''The Raven''. The waning finale is perhaps a premonition of the silence Sibelius would experience twenty years later. In contrast to the usual assertive finales of the times, the work ends simply with a \"leaden thud\".<ref name=alexross/>\n\nSymphony No. 5 was premiered in Helsinki to great acclaim by Sibelius himself on 8 December 1915, his 50th birthday. The version most commonly performed today is the final revision, consisting of three movements, presented in 1919. The Fifth is Sibelius's only symphony in a major key throughout. From its soft opening played by the horns, the work develops into rotational repetitions of its various themes with considerable transformations, building up to the trumpeted swan hymn in the final movement.<ref name=alexross/><ref>{{cite web |title=Fifth symphony op. 82 (1915\u20131919) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_05.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> While the Fifth had already started to veer away from the sonata form, the Sixth, conducted by the composer at its premiere in February 1923, is even further removed from the traditional norms. Tawaststjerna comments that \"the [finale's] structure follows no familiar pattern\".{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=322}} Composed in the [[Dorian mode]], it draws on some of the themes developed while Sibelius was working on the Fifth as well as from material intended for a lyrical violin concerto. Now taking a purified approach, Sibelius sought to offer \"spring water\" rather than cocktails making use of lighter flutes and strings rather than the heavy brass of the Fifth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sixth symphony op. 104 (1923) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_06.htm |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSymphony No. 7 in C major was his last published symphony. Completed in 1924, it is notable for having only one movement. It has been described as \"completely original in form, subtle in its handling of [[tempo|tempi]], individual in its treatment of [[key (music)|key]] and wholly organic in growth\".{{sfn|Layton|2002|p=479}} It has also been called \"Sibelius's most remarkable compositional achievement\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hepokoski|2001}}. Quoted by {{harvnb|Whittall|2004|p=61}}.</ref> Initially titled ''Fantasia sinfonica'', it was first performed in Stockholm in March 1924, conducted by Sibelius. It was based on an adagio movement he had sketched almost ten years earlier.

As a group, the symphonic poems span the entirety of Sibelius's artistic career (the first was composed in 1892, while the last appeared in 1925), display the composer's fascination with nature and Finnish mythology (particularly the ''Kalevala''), and provide a comprehensive portrait of his stylistic maturation over time.{{sfn|Layton|1965|p=95}}\n\n''[[En saga]]'' (meaning a fairy tale) was first presented in February 1893 with Sibelius conducting. The single-movement tone poem was possibly inspired by the Icelandic mythological work ''[[Prose Edda|Edda]]'' although Sibelius simply described it as \"an expression of [his] state of mind\". Beginning with a dreamy theme from the strings, it evolves into the tones of the woodwinds, then the horns and the violas, demonstrating Sibelius's ability to handle an orchestra.<ref>{{cite web |title=En Saga |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_satu.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> The composer's first significant orchestral piece, it was revised in 1902 when Ferruccio Busoni invited Sibelius to conduct his work in Berlin. Its successful reception encouraged him to write to Aino: \"I have been acknowledged as an accomplished 'artist{{' \"}}.{{sfn|Wicklund|2014|p=30}}\n\n''[[The Wood Nymph]]'', a single-movement tone poem for orchestra, was written in 1894. Premiered in April 1895 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting, it is inspired by the Swedish poet [[Viktor Rydberg]]'s work of the same name. Organizationally, it consists of four informal sections, each corresponding to one of the poem's four stanzas and evoking the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigour; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief. Despite the music's beauty, many critics have faulted Sibelius for his \"over-reliance\" on the source material's narrative structure.{{sfn|Kurki|1999}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_metsanhaltijatar.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite]]'' was composed in the early 1890s. Originally conceived as a mythological opera, ''Veneen luominen'' (''The Building of the Boat''), on a scale matching those by [[Richard Wagner]], Sibelius later changed his musical goals and the work became an orchestral piece in four movements. The suite is based on the character Lemmink\u00e4inen from the Finnish national epic, the ''Kalevala''. It can also be considered a collection of [[symphonic poem]]s. The second/third section, ''The Swan of Tuonela'', is often heard separately.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lemmink\u00e4inen |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_lemminkainen.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[Finlandia]]'', probably the best known of all Sibelius's works, is a highly patriotic piece first performed in November 1899 as one of the tableaux for the Finnish Press Celebrations. It had its public premiere in revised form in July 1900.<ref name=incidental/> The current title only emerged later, first for the piano version, then in 1901 when Kajanus conducted the orchestral version under the name ''Finlandia''. Although Sibelius insisted it was primarily an orchestral piece, it became a world favourite for choirs too, especially for the hymn episode. Finally the composer consented and in 1937 and 1940 agreed to words for the hymn, first for the Free Masons and later for more general use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finlandia |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_finlandia.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Oceanides]]'' is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913\u201314. The piece, which refers to the [[Oceanid|nymphs]] in [[Greek mythology]] who inhabited the [[Mediterranean Sea]], premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius himself conducting. The work (in [[D major]]), praised upon its premiere as \"the finest evocation of the sea ever produced in music\",{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=242}} consists of two subjects Sibelius gradually develops in three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.{{sfn| Kilpel\u00e4inen|2012|p=viii}}\n\n''Tapiola'', Sibelius's last major orchestral work, was commissioned by [[Walter Damrosch]] for the [[New York Philharmonic]] Society where it was premiered on 26 December 1926. It is inspired by [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]], a forest spirit from the ''Kalevala''. To quote the American critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], it \"turned out to be Sibelius's most severe and concentrated musical statement.\"<ref name=alexross/> Even more emphatically, the composer and biographer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]] asserts: \"Even if Sibelius had written nothing else, this one work would entitle him to a place among the greatest masters of all time.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Tapiola |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_tapiola.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Other important works===\nThe ''Karelia Music'', one of the composer's earlier works, written for the Vyborg Students' Association, was first performed on 13 November 1893 to a noisy audience. The \"Suite\" emerged from a concert on 23 November consisting of the overture and the three movements, which were published as Op. 11, the ''Karelia Suite''. It remains one of Sibelius's most popular pieces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works: Karelia Music, Overture and Suite |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_karelia.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Valse triste'' is a short orchestral work that was originally part of the incidental music Sibelius composed for his brother-in-law Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt's 1903 play ''Kuolema''. It is now far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of ''Kuolema'' (meaning death). The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as ''Valse triste''. An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces.<ref name=wod/><ref>{{cite web |author=Steinberg, Michael |title=Sibelius: Valse Triste, Opus 44 |publisher=San Francisco Symphony |url=https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060752/https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}</ref>\n\nThe Violin Concerto in D minor was first performed on 8 February 1904 with Victor Nov\u00e1\u010dek as soloist. As Sibelius had barely completed the piece in time for the premiere, Nov\u00e1\u010dek had insufficient time to prepare with the result that the performance was a disaster. After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the [[Staatskapelle Berlin|Berlin Court Orchestra]].

He once said of his Sixth Symphony, \"[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow.\" The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of Tapiola. On the subject of Sibelius's ties to nature, his biographer, Tawaststjerna, wrote:\n<blockquote>Even by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola. He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=21}}</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Leevi Madetoja (circa 1930s).jpg|thumb|left|[[Leevi Madetoja]], Sibelius's most notable pupil and, as a critic, a defender of his works]]\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Jean Sibelius (22).jpg|thumb|Star on ''Musik Meile Vienna'']]\nSibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life, at least in English-speaking and Nordic countries. The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see [[Leevi Madetoja#Relationship with Sibelius|Relationship with Sibelius]]). In Britain, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Arnold Bax]] both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Furthermore, ''Tapiola'' is prominently echoed in both Bax's [[Symphony No. 6 (Bax)|Sixth Symphony]] and Moeran's [[Symphony in G minor (Moeran)|Symphony in G Minor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sir Arnold Bax |publisher=Chandos |url=http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202420/http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}</ref>{{sfn|Schaarw\u00e4chter|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EIvoCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA494 494]}} The influence of Sibelius's compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]] of [[William Walton]].{{sfn|Freed|1995}} When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors like Beecham and [[John Barbirolli|Barbirolli]] championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton's composer friend [[Constant Lambert]] even asserted that Sibelius was \"the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form\".{{sfn|Lambert|1934|p=318}} Earlier, [[Granville Bantock]] had championed Sibelius (the esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society). More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]. [[Malcolm Arnold]] acknowledged his influence, and [[Arthur Butterworth]] also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work.{{sfn|Walker|2008}}\n\nEugene Ormandy and to a lesser extent, his predecessor with the Philadelphia Orchestra [[Leopold Stokowski]], were instrumental in bringing Sibelius's music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life. Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic [[Olin Downes]], who wrote a biography of the composer.{{sfn|Goss|1995}}\n\nIn 1938 [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that \"If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1938}} Adorno sent his essay to [[Virgil Thomson]], then music critic of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', who was also critical of Sibelius; Thomson, while agreeing with the essay's sentiment, declared to Adorno that \"the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius\".{{sfn|Ross|2009}} Later, the composer, theorist and conductor [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]] went so far as to describe Sibelius as \"the worst composer in the world\" in the title of a 1955 pamphlet.{{sfn|Leibowitz|1955}}\n\nPerhaps one reason Sibelius has attracted both the praise and the ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached the basic problems of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route.{{sfn|M\u00e4kel\u00e4|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbZJHaL_9AC&pg=PA269 269]}} Sibelius's response to criticism was dismissive: \"Pay no attention to what critics say.

First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon).

Acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality, Andsnes believes that the common critical dismissal is unwarranted.

He was the son of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius n\u00e9e Borg. The family name stems from the Sibbe estate in [[Eastern Uusimaa]], which his paternal great-grandfather owned.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=8}} Sibelius's father died of [[typhoid]] in July 1868, leaving substantial debts. As a result, his mother\u2014who was again pregnant\u2014had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in H\u00e4meenlinna.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=19}} Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin. It was he who gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=905}} For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but acted as a musical adviser.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}}\n\nFrom an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to [[Loviisa]] on the coast for the summer months. In his own words: \"For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness. H\u00e4meenlinna was where I went to school; Loviisa was freedom.\" It was in H\u00e4meenlinna, when he was seven, that his aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family's upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note. He progressed by improvising on his own, but still learned to read music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=4}} He later turned to the violin, which he preferred. He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda on piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello. ([[Christian Sibelius]] was to become an eminent [[psychiatrist]], still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland.)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibelius |language=Swedish |year=1926 |publisher=Nordisk Familjebok |url=http://runeberg.org/nfcr/0165.html |accessdate=11 June 2015 |p=281}}</ref> Furthermore, Sibelius often played in quartets with neighboring families, adding to his experience in chamber music. Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a ''Suite in D Minor'' for violin and piano.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|pp=10\u201313}} Around 1881, he recorded on paper his short [[pizzicato]] piece ''Vattendroppar'' (Water Drops) for violin and cello, although it might just have been a musical exercise.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Music becomes a serious pursuit 1881\u20131885 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_musiikkiharrastus.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> The first reference he to himself composing is in a letter from August 1883 in which he writes that he composed a trio and was working on another: \"They are rather poor, but it is nice to have something to do on rainy days.\"<ref name=\"childhood\"/> In 1881, he started to take violin lessons from the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=6}} Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon succeeded in becoming quite an accomplished player, performing [[Ferdinand David (musician)|David]]'s Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto]] in Helsinki.

One of his teachers was its founder, Martin Wegelius, who did much to support the development of education in Finland. It was he who gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=75}} Another important influence was his teacher [[Ferruccio Busoni]], a pianist-composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}} His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer [[Adolf Paul]] and the conductor-to-be [[Armas J\u00e4rnefelt]], (who introduced him to his influential family including his sister [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]] who would become Sibelius's wife).{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}} The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of [[Grieg]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=62}}\n\nSibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with [[Albert Becker (composer)|Albert Becker]], and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with [[Robert Fuchs]] and Hungarian-Jewish [[Karl Goldmark]]. In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]''. He also heard the Finnish composer [[Robert Kajanus]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in a program that included his symphonic poem ''Aino'', a patriotic piece that may have triggered Sibelius's later interest in using the epic poem ''Kalevala'' as a basis for his own compositions.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Kalevala taiteessa \u2013 Musiikissa: Ensimm\u00e4iset Kalevala-aiheiset s\u00e4vellykset |language=Finnish |publisher=Kalevalan Kultuuruhistoria |url=http://www.kalevalaseura.fi/kaku/sivu.php?n=p1a1&s=p1a1s1&h=hp1a1&f=fp1s |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> While in Vienna, he became particularly interested in the music of [[Anton Bruckner]] whom, for a time, he regarded as \"the greatest living composer\", although he continued to show interest in the established works of [[Beethoven]] and [[Wagner]]. He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends. It was also in Vienna that he turned to orchestral composition, working on an Overture in E major and a ''Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet''. While embarking on ''Kullervo'', an orchestral work inspired by the ''Kalevala'', he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone- excision surgery.<ref>{{cite web |title=Studies in Vienna 1890\u201391 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_opinnot_wien.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Shortly after returning to Helsinki, Sibelius thoroughly enjoyed conducting his Overture and the ''Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet'' at a popular concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kullervo and the wedding 1891\u20131892 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kullervo.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> He was also able to continue working on ''Kullervo'', now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things Finnish.

Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink \u2014 unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.{{sfn|Kaufman|1938|p=218}}</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin (1889\u201391), in 1900 he travelled to Italy where he spent a year with his family. He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, the UK, France and Germany and later travelled to the United States.{{sfn|Goss|2011|p=162}}\n\n===Marriage and rise to fame===\nWhile Sibelius was studying music in Helsinki in the autumn of 1888, Armas J\u00e4rnefelt, a friend from the Music Institute, invited him to the family home.

It was described by the composer {{Interlanguage link multi|Aksel T\u00f6rnudd|fi}} as \"a volcanic eruption\" while Juho Ranta who sang in the choir stated, \"It was ''Finnish'' music.\"{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=74}} At the end of that year the composer's grandmother, Katarina Borg died. Sibelius went to her funeral, visiting his H\u00e4meenlinna home one last time before the house was sold. On 16 February 1893, the first (extended) version of ''En saga'' was presented in Helsinki although it was not too well received, the critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated (as they were in Sibelius's 1902 version). Even less successful were three more performances of ''Kullervo'' in March, which one critic found was incomprehensible and lacking in vitality. Following the birth of Sibelius's first child Eva, in April the premiere of his choral work ''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's Boat Ride'' was a considerable success, receiving the support of the press.<ref name=\"symposion\">{{cite web |title=The Symposion years 1892\u20131897 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_symbosion.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November 1893, the full version of ''Karelia'' was premiered at a student association gala at the Seurahuone in [[Viipuri Province|Viipuri]] with the collaboration of the artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela|Axel Gall\u00e9n]] and the sculptor [[Emil Wikstr\u00f6m]] who had been brought in to design the stage sets. While the first performance was difficult to appreciate over the background noise of the talkative audience, a second performance on 18 November was more successful. Furthermore, on the 19th and 23rd Sibelius presented an extended suite of the work in Helsinki, conducting the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=85}} Sibelius's music was increasingly presented in Helsinki's concert halls. In the 1894\u201395 season, works such as ''En saga'', ''Karelia'' and ''[[Spring Song (Sibelius)|V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng]]'' (composed in 1894) were included in at least 16 concerts in the capital, not to mention those in [[Turku]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=162}} When performed in a revised version on 17 April 1895, the composer [[Oskar Merikanto]] welcomed ''V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng'' (Spring Song) as \"the fairest flower among Sibelius's orchestral pieces\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibelius: Spring Song (original 1894) |publisher=ClassicLive |url=http://www.classiclive.com/sibelius-spring-song-original-1984 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gallen-Kallela Symposium.jpg|thumb|Sibelius (right) socializing with Akseli Gallen-Kallela (the artist, left), Oskar Merikanto and Robert Kajanus]]\nFor a considerable period, Sibelius worked on an opera, ''[[Veneen luominen]]'' (The Building of the Boat), again based on the ''Kalevala''. To some extent, he had come under the influence of Wagner, but subsequently turned to [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration. Adapted from material for the opera, which he never completed, his ''Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite'' consisted of four legends in the form of tone poems.{{sfn|Murtom\u00e4ki|2000}} They were premiered in Helsinki on 13 April 1896 to a full house. In contrast to Merikanto's enthusiasm for the Finnish quality of the work, the critic Karl Flodin found the cor anglais solo in ''The Swan of Tuonela'' \"stupendously long and boring\",{{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=101}}<ref name=\"symposion\"/> although he considered the first legend, ''Lemmink\u00e4inen and the Maidens of the Island'', as representing the peak of Sibelius's achievement to date.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=166}}\n\nTo pay his way, from 1892 Sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at the Music Institute and at Kajanus's conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=988}} The situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant, initially for ten years and later extended for life. He was able to complete [[King Christian II (Sibelius)|the music]] for Adolf Paul's play ''King Christian II''. Performed on 24 February 1898, its catchy tunes appealed to the public. The scores of four popular pieces from the play were published in Germany and sold well in Finland. When the orchestral suite was successfully performed in Helsinki in November 1898, Sibelius commented: \"The music sounded excellent and the tempi seem to be right. I think this is the first time that I have managed to make something complete.\" The work was also performed in Stockholm and Leipzig.<ref name=\"tib\">{{cite web |title=Towards an international breakthrough 1897\u20131899 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kohti_lapimurtoa.htm |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1899, Sibelius embarked on his [[Symphony No. 1 (Sibelius)|First Symphony]] at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by the Russian emperor [[Nicholas II]]'s attempt to [[Russification of Finland|restrict the powers of the Grand Duchy of Finland]].<ref name=club/> The symphony was well received by all when it was premiered in Helsinki on 26 April 1899.

Nevertheless, in the spring Sibelius went on an international tour with Kajanus and his orchestra, presenting his recent works (including a revised version of his First Symphony) in thirteen cities including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin and Paris.

It was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in Helsinki on 8 March. The work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by the Finns. Merikanto felt it exceeded \"even the boldest expectations,\" while Evert Katila qualified it as \"an absolute masterpiece\".<ref name=\"cdib\"/> Flodin, too, wrote of a symphonic composition \"the likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before\".{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=71}}\n\nSibelius spent the summer in Tv\u00e4rminne near [[Hanko]], where he worked on the song ''Var det en dr\u00f6m'' (Was it a Dream) as well as on a new version of ''En saga''. When it was performed in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1902, it served to firmly establish the composer's reputation in Germany, leading shortly afterwards to the publication of his First Symphony.<ref name=\"cdib\"/>\n\nIn 1903, Sibelius spent much of his time in Helsinki where he indulged excessively in wining and dining, running up considerable bills in the restaurants. But he continued to compose, one of his major successes being ''Valse triste'', one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law [[Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt]]'s play ''[[Kuolema]]'' (Death). Short of money, he sold the piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in Finland but internationally. During his long stays in Helsinki, Sibelius's wife Aino frequently wrote to him, imploring him to return home but to no avail. Even after their fourth daughter, Katarina, was born, he continued to work away from home. Early in 1904, he finished his Violin Concerto but its first public performance on 8 February was not a success.

To cover the construction costs, he gave concerts in Helsinki, Turku and Vaasa in early 1904 as well as in Tallinn, Estonia, and in Latvia during the summer. The family were finally able to move into the new property on 24 September 1904, making friends with the local artistic community, including the painters [[Eero J\u00e4rnefelt]] and [[Pekka Halonen]] and the novelist [[Juhani Aho]].<ref name=wod/>\n\nIn January 1905, Sibelius returned to Berlin where he conducted his Second Symphony. While the concert itself was successful, it received mixed reviews, some very positive while those in the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' were less enthusiastic. Back in Finland, he rewrote the increasingly popular ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Sibelius)|Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande]]'' as an orchestral suite. In November, visiting Britain for the first time, he went to [[Liverpool]] where he met [[Henry Wood]].

His lifestyle had a disastrous effect on the health of Aino who was driven to retire to a sanatorium, suffering from exhaustion. While she was away, Sibelius resolved to give up drinking, concentrating instead on composing his [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]]. He completed the work for a performance in Helsinki on 25 September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classiclive.com/Sibelius-Symphony-No3|title=Sibelius: Symphony No. 3|date=15 September 2014|via=www.classiclive.com}}</ref> Although its more classical approach surprised the audience, Flodin commented that it was \"internally new and revolutionary\".<ref name=fya/>\n\nShortly afterwards Sibelius met [[Gustav Mahler]] who was in Helsinki. The two agreed that with each new symphony, they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works. This was demonstrated above all in St Petersburg where the Third Symphony was performed in November 1907 to dismissive reviews. Its reception in Moscow was rather more positive.<ref name=fya/>\n\n[[File:Jean Sibelius 15 Gloucester Walk blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 15 Gloucester Walk, [[Kensington]], London, his home in 1909]]\nIn 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat cancer.\nEarly in 1908, Sibelius had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius's health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all.<ref name=fya/> The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including ''[[Luonnotar (Sibelius)|Luonnotar]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]].{{sfn|Woodstra|2005|pp=1279\u20131282}}\n\n===More pleasant times===\n[[File:Finlandia premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition.gif|thumb|Finlandia (first edition)]]\n\nIn 1909, the successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between Sibelius and Aino in the family home. In Britain too, his condition was well received as he conducted ''En saga'', ''Finlandia'', ''Valse Triste'' and ''Spring Song'' to enthusiastic audiences. A meeting with [[Claude Debussy]] produced further support. After another uneventful trip to Paris, he went to Berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful.<ref name=iv>{{cite web |title=Inner voices 1908\u20131914 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_sisaisia_aania.htm |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius started work on his Fourth Symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs. In October, he conducted concerts in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo) where ''[[The Dryad (Sibelius)|The Dryad]]'' and ''[[In Memoriam (Sibelius)|In Memoriam]]'' were first performed. His ''Valse triste'' and Second Symphony were particularly well received. He then travelled to Berlin to continue work on his Fourth Symphony, writing the finale after returning to J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4.<ref name=iv/>\n\nSibelius conducted his first concerts in Sweden in early 1911 when even his Third Symphony was welcomed by the critics. He completed the Fourth Symphony in April but, as he expected, with its introspective style it was not very warmly received when first performed in Helsinki with mixed reviews. Apart from a trip to Paris where he enjoyed a performance of Richard Strauss's ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', the rest of the year was fairly uneventful. In 1912, he completed his short orchestral work ''Sc\u00e8nes historiques II''. It was first performed in March together with the Fourth Symphony. The concert was repeated twice to enthusiastic audiences and critics including Robert Kajanus. The Fourth Symphony was also well received in [[Birmingham]] in September. In March 1913, it was performed in New York but a large section of the audience left the hall between the movements while in October, after a concert conducted by [[Carl Muck]], the ''Boston American'' labelled it \"a sad failure\".<ref name=iv/>\n\nSibelius's first significant composition of 1913 was the tone poem ''[[The Bard (Sibelius)|The Bard]]'', which he conducted in March to a respectful audience in Helsinki. He went on to compose ''Luonnotar'' (Daughter of Nature) for soprano and orchestra. With a text from the ''Kalevala'', it was first performed in Finnish in September 1913 by [[Aino Ackt\u00e9]] (to whom it had been dedicated) at the [[Three Choirs Festival|music festival]] in [[Gloucester]], England.<ref name=iv/><ref>{{cite web |author=Ozorio, Anne |title=Appreciating Sibelius's Luonnotar Op. 70 by Anne Ozorio |publisher=MusicWeb |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/mar07/Luonnotar.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> In early 1914, Sibelius spent a month in Berlin where he was particularly drawn to [[Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg]]. Back in Finland, he began work on ''The Oceanides'', which the American millionaire Carl Stoeckel had commissioned for the [[Norfolk Chamber Music Festival|Norfolk Music Festival]]. After first composing the work in D flat major, Sibelius undertook substantive revisions, presenting a D major version in Norfolk, which was well received, as were ''Finlandia'' and the ''Valse triste''. [[Henry Krehbiel]] considered ''The Oceanides'' one of the most beautiful pieces of sea music ever composed, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that Sibelius's music was the most notable contribution to the music festival. While in America, Sibelius received an honorary doctorate from [[Yale University]] and, almost simultaneously, one from the University of Helsinki where he was represented by Aino.<ref name=iv/>\n\n===First World War years===\nWhile travelling back from the United States, Sibelius heard about the events in [[Sarajevo]] that led to the beginning of the [[First World War]]. Although he was far away from the fighting, his royalties from abroad were interrupted. To make ends meet, he composed smaller works for publication in Finland. In March 1915, he was able to travel to Gothenburg in Sweden where his ''The Oceanides'' was really appreciated. While working on his [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]] in April, he saw 16 swans flying by, inspiring him to write the finale. \"One of the great experiences of my life!\" he commented. Although there was little progress on the symphony during the summer, he was able to complete it by his 50th birthday on 8 December.<ref name=wfs>{{cite web |title=The war and the fifth symphony 1915\u20131919 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viides_sinfonia.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of his birthday, Sibelius conducted the premiere of the Fifth Symphony in the hall of the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]]. Despite high praise from Kajanus, the composer was not satisfied with his work and soon began to revise it. Around this time, Sibelius was running ever deeper into debt. The grand piano he had received as a present was about to be confiscated by the bailiffs when the singer [[Ida Ekman]] paid off a large proportion of his debt after a successful fund-raising campaign.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nA year later, on 8 December 1916, Sibelius presented the revised version of his Fifth Symphony in Turku, combining the first two movements and simplifying the finale. When it was performed a week later in Helsinki, Katila was very favourable but Wasenius frowned on the changes, leading the composer to rewrite it once again.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nFrom the beginning of 1917, Sibelius started drinking again, triggering arguments with Aino. Their relationship improved with the excitement resulting from the start of the [[Russian Revolution]]. By the end of the year, Sibelius had composed his ''[[J\u00e4ger March]]''. The piece proved particularly popular after the Finnish parliament accepted the Senate's declaration of independence from Russia in December 1917. The ''J\u00e4ger March'', first played on 19 January 1918, delighted the Helsinki elite for a short time until the launch of the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 27 January.<ref name=wfs/> Sibelius naturally supported the [[White Guards (Finland)|Whites]], but as a [[tolstoyan]], Aino Sibelius had some sympathies for the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Reds]] too.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}\n\nIn February, the house Ainola was searched twice by the local Red Guard looking for weapons. During the first weeks of the war, some of his acquaintances were killed in the violence, and his brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius, was arrested as he refused to reserve beds for the Red soldiers who had suffered shell shock at the front. Sibelius' friends in Helsinki were now worried about his safety. The composer Robert Kajanus had negotiations with the Red Guard commander-in-chief [[Eero Haapalainen]], who guaranteed Sibelius a safe journey from Ainola to the capital. In 20 February, a group of Red Guard fighters escorted the family to Helsinki. Finally, in 12\u201313 April, the German troops [[Battle of Helsinki|occupied]] the city and the Red period was over. A week later, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] gave a homage concert for the German commander [[R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz]], Sibelius finished off the event by conducting the ''J\u00e4ger March''.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}\n\n===Revived fortunes===\n[[File:Jean Sibelius 1923.gif|thumb|upright|Sibelius in 1923]]\n\nIn early 1919, Sibelius enthusiastically decided to change his image, removing his thinning hair. In June, together with Aino, he visited Copenhagen on his first trip outside Finland since 1915, successfully presenting his Second Symphony. In November he conducted the final version of his Fifth Symphony, receiving repeated ovations from the audience. By the end of the year, he was already working on the Sixth.<ref name=wfs/>\n\nIn 1920, despite a growing tremor in his hands, Sibelius composed the ''Hymn of the Earth'' to a text by the poet [[Eino Leino]] for the Suomen Laulu Choir and orchestrated his ''Valse lyrique'', helped along by drinking wine. On his birthday in December 1920, Sibelius received a donation of 63,000 marks, a substantial sum the tenor {{Interlanguage link multi|W\u00e4in\u00f6 Sola|fi}} had raised from Finnish businesses. Although he used some of the money to reduce his debts, he also spent a week celebrating to excess in Helsinki.<ref name=lmp>{{cite web |title=The last masterpieces 1920\u20131927 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viimeiset.htm |accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius enjoyed a highly successful trip to England in early 1921\u2014conducting several concerts around the country, including the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, ''The Oceanides'', the ever-popular ''Finlandia'', and ''Valse triste''. Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and ''Valse triste'' in Norway. He was beginning to suffer from exhaustion, but the critics remained positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented ''Lemmink\u00e4inen's Return'' and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.<ref name=lmp/>\n\nEarly in 1922, after suffering from headaches Sibelius decided to acquire spectacles although he never wore them for photographs. In July, he was saddened by the death of his brother Christian. In August, he joined the Finnish Freemasons and composed ritual music for them. In February 1923, he premiered his [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Sixth Symphony]]. Evert Katila highly praised it as \"pure idyll.\" Before the year ended he had also conducted concerts in Stockholm and Rome, the first to considerable acclaim, the second to mixed reviews. He then proceeded to Gothenburg where he enjoyed an ecstatic reception despite arriving at the concert hall suffering from over-indulgence in food and drink. Despite continuing to drink, to Aino's dismay, Sibelius managed to complete his Seventh Symphony in early 1924. In March, under the title of ''Fantasia sinfonica'' it received its first public performance in Stockholm where it was a success. It was even more highly appreciated at a series of concerts in Copenhagen in late September. Sibelius was honoured with the Knight Commander's Cross of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].<ref name=lmp/>\n\nHe spent most of the rest of the year resting as his recent spate of activity was straining his heart and nerves. Composing a few small pieces, he relied increasingly on alcohol. In May 1925, his Danish publisher [[Edition Wilhelm Hansen|Wilhelm Hansen]] and the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] invited him to compose incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. He completed the work well in advance of its premiere in March 1926.<ref name=lmp/> It was well received in Copenhagen although Sibelius was not there himself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Incidental music: Sibelius: Music for \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare, op. 109 (1925\u201326) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/nayttamo_myrsky.htm |accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Last major contributions===\n[[File:Sibelius-puolisot kes\u00e4iltana kasvitarhan penkill\u00e4, 1940-1945, (d2005 167 6 101) Suomen valokuvataiteen museo.jpg|thumb|Sibelius and Aino in [[J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4]] (early 1940s)]]\n\nThe year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius's output: after his Seventh Symphony, he produced only a few major works during the rest of his life.

After the raid on Finland by the Soviet Union on 30 November 1939, the Sibelius family returned for good to Ainola in the summer of 1941, after a long absence. Anxious about Bolshevism, Sibelius advocated that Finnish soldiers march alongside the German army against the Soviet Union. Sibelius did not make any utterances about the genocide of the Jews although, in a diary entry in 1943, he wondered why he had signed the Aryan certificate.<ref>Dagbok, p. 336</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1939, Sibelius participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his ''[[Andante Festivo]]''.

His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony ''Kullervo'', which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem ''Kalevala''. His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially ''En saga'', ''The Swan of Tuonela'' and ''Valse triste''.<ref name=alexross>{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=9 July 2007 |title=Sibelius: Apparition from the Woods |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2007/07/sibelius-chapte.html |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> Sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a Violin Concerto, the opera ''Jungfrun i tornet'', many shorter orchestral pieces, chamber music, works for piano and violin, choral works and numerous songs.{{sfn|Poroila|2012}}\n\nIn the mid-1920s, after his Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, he composed the symphonic poem ''Tapiola'' and incidental music for ''The Tempest''. Thereafter, although he lived until 1957, he did not publish any further works of note. For several years, he worked on an Eighth Symphony, which he later burned.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Gramophone |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/composers/jean-sibelius-39924 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs for his musical style, hints of Tchaikovsky's music are particularly evident in early works such as his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=209}} For a period, he was nevertheless overwhelmed by Wagner, particularly while composing his opera. More lasting influences included Ferruccio Busoni and Anton Bruckner. But for his tone poems, he was above all inspired by [[Liszt]].<ref name=\"symposion\"/>{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=102}} The similarities to Bruckner can be seen in the brass contributions to his orchestral works and the generally slow tempo of his music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vkIWs6nvRs8C&pg=PA63 63]}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Kalamidas, Thanos |date=12 August 2009 |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Ovi Magazine |url=http://www.ovimagazine.com/art/5165 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of [[sonata form]] in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger \"themes\" effectively prove the opposite.{{sfn|Pike|1978|page=93}}\n\n[[File:Jean Sibelius by Eero J\u00e4rnefelt 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Sibelius from 1892 by his brother-in-law [[Eero J\u00e4rnefelt]]]]\nThis self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius's primary rival in symphonic composition.{{sfn|Botstein|2011}} While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler's style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together, leading Sibelius to comment:\n<blockquote>I said that I admired [the symphony's] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs&nbsp;... Mahler's opinion was just the reverse. \"No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.\"{{sfn|James|1989|p=41}}</blockquote>\n\n===Symphonies===\n[[File:Robert Kajanus (14854805748).jpg|left|thumb|Robert Kajanus, founder and chief conductor of the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], who was a notable interpreter of Sibelius's symphonies]]\n\nSibelius started work on his Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, in 1898 and completed it in early 1899, when he was 33.

The opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for the whole work. The heroic theme of the finale with the three-tone motif is interpreted by the trumpets rather than the original woodwinds. During a period of Russian oppression, it consolidated Sibelius's reputation as a national hero. After the first performance, Sibelius made some changes, leading to a revised version first performed by Armas J\u00e4rnefelt on 10 November 1903 in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web |title=Second symphony op. 43 (1902)\n|work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_02.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Third Symphony is a good-natured, triumphal, and deceptively simple-sounding piece. The symphony's first performance was given by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer, on 25 September 1907. There are themes from Finnish folk music in the work's early chords. Composed just after his move to Ainola, it contrasts sharply with the first two symphonies, with its clear mode of expression developing into the marching tones of the finale.<ref name=alexross/><ref>{{cite web |title=Third symphony op. 52 (1907) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_03.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> His Fourth Symphony was premiered in Helsinki on 3 April 1911 by the Philharmonia Society, with Sibelius conducting. It was written while Sibelius was undergoing a series of operations to remove a tumour from his throat. Its grimness can perhaps be explained as a reaction from his (temporary) decision to give up drinking. The opening bars, with cellos, basses and bassoons, convey a new approach to timing. It then develops into melancholic sketches based on the composer's setting of Poe's ''The Raven''. The waning finale is perhaps a premonition of the silence Sibelius would experience twenty years later. In contrast to the usual assertive finales of the times, the work ends simply with a \"leaden thud\".<ref name=alexross/>\n\nSymphony No. 5 was premiered in Helsinki to great acclaim by Sibelius himself on 8 December 1915, his 50th birthday. The version most commonly performed today is the final revision, consisting of three movements, presented in 1919. The Fifth is Sibelius's only symphony in a major key throughout. From its soft opening played by the horns, the work develops into rotational repetitions of its various themes with considerable transformations, building up to the trumpeted swan hymn in the final movement.<ref name=alexross/><ref>{{cite web |title=Fifth symphony op. 82 (1915\u20131919) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_05.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> While the Fifth had already started to veer away from the sonata form, the Sixth, conducted by the composer at its premiere in February 1923, is even further removed from the traditional norms. Tawaststjerna comments that \"the [finale's] structure follows no familiar pattern\".{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=322}} Composed in the [[Dorian mode]], it draws on some of the themes developed while Sibelius was working on the Fifth as well as from material intended for a lyrical violin concerto. Now taking a purified approach, Sibelius sought to offer \"spring water\" rather than cocktails making use of lighter flutes and strings rather than the heavy brass of the Fifth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sixth symphony op. 104 (1923) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_06.htm |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSymphony No. 7 in C major was his last published symphony. Completed in 1924, it is notable for having only one movement. It has been described as \"completely original in form, subtle in its handling of [[tempo|tempi]], individual in its treatment of [[key (music)|key]] and wholly organic in growth\".{{sfn|Layton|2002|p=479}} It has also been called \"Sibelius's most remarkable compositional achievement\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hepokoski|2001}}. Quoted by {{harvnb|Whittall|2004|p=61}}.</ref> Initially titled ''Fantasia sinfonica'', it was first performed in Stockholm in March 1924, conducted by Sibelius. It was based on an adagio movement he had sketched almost ten years earlier. While the strings dominate, there is also a distinctive trombone theme.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seventh symphony op. 105 (1924) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_07.htm |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tone poems===\nAfter the seven symphonies and the violin concerto, Sibelius's thirteen symphonic poems are his most important works for orchestra and, along with the tone poems of Richard Strauss, represent some of the most important contributions to the genre since Franz Liszt. As a group, the symphonic poems span the entirety of Sibelius's artistic career (the first was composed in 1892, while the last appeared in 1925), display the composer's fascination with nature and Finnish mythology (particularly the ''Kalevala''), and provide a comprehensive portrait of his stylistic maturation over time.{{sfn|Layton|1965|p=95}}\n\n''[[En saga]]'' (meaning a fairy tale) was first presented in February 1893 with Sibelius conducting. The single-movement tone poem was possibly inspired by the Icelandic mythological work ''[[Prose Edda|Edda]]'' although Sibelius simply described it as \"an expression of [his] state of mind\". Beginning with a dreamy theme from the strings, it evolves into the tones of the woodwinds, then the horns and the violas, demonstrating Sibelius's ability to handle an orchestra.<ref>{{cite web |title=En Saga |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_satu.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> The composer's first significant orchestral piece, it was revised in 1902 when Ferruccio Busoni invited Sibelius to conduct his work in Berlin. Its successful reception encouraged him to write to Aino: \"I have been acknowledged as an accomplished 'artist{{' \"}}.{{sfn|Wicklund|2014|p=30}}\n\n''[[The Wood Nymph]]'', a single-movement tone poem for orchestra, was written in 1894. Premiered in April 1895 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting, it is inspired by the Swedish poet [[Viktor Rydberg]]'s work of the same name. Organizationally, it consists of four informal sections, each corresponding to one of the poem's four stanzas and evoking the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigour; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief. Despite the music's beauty, many critics have faulted Sibelius for his \"over-reliance\" on the source material's narrative structure.{{sfn|Kurki|1999}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_metsanhaltijatar.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite]]'' was composed in the early 1890s. Originally conceived as a mythological opera, ''Veneen luominen'' (''The Building of the Boat''), on a scale matching those by [[Richard Wagner]], Sibelius later changed his musical goals and the work became an orchestral piece in four movements. The suite is based on the character Lemmink\u00e4inen from the Finnish national epic, the ''Kalevala''. It can also be considered a collection of [[symphonic poem]]s. The second/third section, ''The Swan of Tuonela'', is often heard separately.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lemmink\u00e4inen |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_lemminkainen.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[Finlandia]]'', probably the best known of all Sibelius's works, is a highly patriotic piece first performed in November 1899 as one of the tableaux for the Finnish Press Celebrations. It had its public premiere in revised form in July 1900.<ref name=incidental/> The current title only emerged later, first for the piano version, then in 1901 when Kajanus conducted the orchestral version under the name ''Finlandia''. Although Sibelius insisted it was primarily an orchestral piece, it became a world favourite for choirs too, especially for the hymn episode. Finally the composer consented and in 1937 and 1940 agreed to words for the hymn, first for the Free Masons and later for more general use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finlandia |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_finlandia.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Oceanides]]'' is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913\u201314. The piece, which refers to the [[Oceanid|nymphs]] in [[Greek mythology]] who inhabited the [[Mediterranean Sea]], premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius himself conducting. The work (in [[D major]]), praised upon its premiere as \"the finest evocation of the sea ever produced in music\",{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=242}} consists of two subjects Sibelius gradually develops in three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.{{sfn| Kilpel\u00e4inen|2012|p=viii}}\n\n''Tapiola'', Sibelius's last major orchestral work, was commissioned by [[Walter Damrosch]] for the [[New York Philharmonic]] Society where it was premiered on 26 December 1926. It is inspired by [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]], a forest spirit from the ''Kalevala''. To quote the American critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], it \"turned out to be Sibelius's most severe and concentrated musical statement.\"<ref name=alexross/> Even more emphatically, the composer and biographer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]] asserts: \"Even if Sibelius had written nothing else, this one work would entitle him to a place among the greatest masters of all time.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Tapiola |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_tapiola.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Other important works===\nThe ''Karelia Music'', one of the composer's earlier works, written for the Vyborg Students' Association, was first performed on 13 November 1893 to a noisy audience. The \"Suite\" emerged from a concert on 23 November consisting of the overture and the three movements, which were published as Op. 11, the ''Karelia Suite''. It remains one of Sibelius's most popular pieces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works: Karelia Music, Overture and Suite |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_karelia.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Valse triste'' is a short orchestral work that was originally part of the incidental music Sibelius composed for his brother-in-law Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt's 1903 play ''Kuolema''. It is now far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of ''Kuolema'' (meaning death). The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as ''Valse triste''. An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces.<ref name=wod/><ref>{{cite web |author=Steinberg, Michael |title=Sibelius: Valse Triste, Opus 44 |publisher=San Francisco Symphony |url=https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060752/https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}</ref>\n\nThe Violin Concerto in D minor was first performed on 8 February 1904 with Victor Nov\u00e1\u010dek as soloist. As Sibelius had barely completed the piece in time for the premiere, Nov\u00e1\u010dek had insufficient time to prepare with the result that the performance was a disaster. After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the [[Staatskapelle Berlin|Berlin Court Orchestra]].

He once said of his Sixth Symphony, \"[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow.\" The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of Tapiola. On the subject of Sibelius's ties to nature, his biographer, Tawaststjerna, wrote:\n<blockquote>Even by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola. He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=21}}</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Leevi Madetoja (circa 1930s).jpg|thumb|left|[[Leevi Madetoja]], Sibelius's most notable pupil and, as a critic, a defender of his works]]\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Jean Sibelius (22).jpg|thumb|Star on ''Musik Meile Vienna'']]\nSibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life, at least in English-speaking and Nordic countries. The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see [[Leevi Madetoja#Relationship with Sibelius|Relationship with Sibelius]]). In Britain, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Arnold Bax]] both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Furthermore, ''Tapiola'' is prominently echoed in both Bax's [[Symphony No. 6 (Bax)|Sixth Symphony]] and Moeran's [[Symphony in G minor (Moeran)|Symphony in G Minor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sir Arnold Bax |publisher=Chandos |url=http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202420/http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}</ref>{{sfn|Schaarw\u00e4chter|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EIvoCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA494 494]}} The influence of Sibelius's compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]] of [[William Walton]].{{sfn|Freed|1995}} When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors like Beecham and [[John Barbirolli|Barbirolli]] championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton's composer friend [[Constant Lambert]] even asserted that Sibelius was \"the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form\".{{sfn|Lambert|1934|p=318}} Earlier, [[Granville Bantock]] had championed Sibelius (the esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society). More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]. [[Malcolm Arnold]] acknowledged his influence, and [[Arthur Butterworth]] also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work.{{sfn|Walker|2008}}\n\nEugene Ormandy and to a lesser extent, his predecessor with the Philadelphia Orchestra [[Leopold Stokowski]], were instrumental in bringing Sibelius's music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life. Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic [[Olin Downes]], who wrote a biography of the composer.{{sfn|Goss|1995}}\n\nIn 1938 [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that \"If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1938}} Adorno sent his essay to [[Virgil Thomson]], then music critic of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', who was also critical of Sibelius; Thomson, while agreeing with the essay's sentiment, declared to Adorno that \"the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius\".{{sfn|Ross|2009}} Later, the composer, theorist and conductor [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]] went so far as to describe Sibelius as \"the worst composer in the world\" in the title of a 1955 pamphlet.{{sfn|Leibowitz|1955}}\n\nPerhaps one reason Sibelius has attracted both the praise and the ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached the basic problems of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route.{{sfn|M\u00e4kel\u00e4|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbZJHaL_9AC&pg=PA269 269]}} Sibelius's response to criticism was dismissive: \"Pay no attention to what critics say.

First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon).

Acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality, Andsnes believes that the common critical dismissal is unwarranted.

The AM (10,000 watts at 850&nbsp;kHz) and FM (35,000 watts at 96.1&nbsp;MHz) radio stations were sold to an independent broadcaster, Ted Oberfelter, who changed the call letters to WKIX and WKIX-FM to avoid the association with the newspaper.\n\n===WKIX, Channel 85===\nIn 1958, Hugh Holder, a former CBS announcer, bought the radio stations. Holder changed the format from easy listening to [[top 40]] , serving the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill market. Known as \"WKIX, Channel 85\", \"The Giant of the South\", and \"The Mighty 850\", the station was one of the most successful popular music outlets in the US from the late 1950s through the 1970s.

Previously, the FM signal had mostly duplicated WKIX's programming, getting a boost from the rising popularity of FM and also providing improved full-time coverage of the entire Raleigh-Durham market. As FM became more dominant, the WKIX-FM call sign was changed to WYYD, power was increased to 100,000 watts, and the station was programmed separately as easy-listening.\n\nIn the 1970s, the station had a strong news department, with such icons as: Bill Leslie (now at [[WRAL-TV]] and is also an accomplished musician), Mike Blackmon (who went on to [[WPTF]]), Scott White, Steven Reid, Max Powell, Edward Faircloth, Raymond Caulder, Bill McQuage; Joe Goodpasture,  [[John Tesh]] (who went on to co-host ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and now writes and produces music), Steve Shumake, J.

Licensed to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], United States, the station serves the [[The Triangle (North Carolina)|Research Triangle, North Carolina]] area.  The station is owned by [[Curtis Media Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WPTK |title=WPTK Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}</ref>  Its studios are located in Raleigh, and the transmitter site is in [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]] near its border with [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]].  The station uses \"Just Right Radio\" to describe itself and uses the slogan \"Not too hard, not too soft\" to describe its music.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n'''WNAO''' signed on in 1947, owned by the ''[[News and Observer]]'' newspaper. As of 1948, WNAO was an [[Citadel Media|ABC radio]] affiliate. [[WBBB|WNAO-FM]] was added in 1949.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Sir Walter Television purchased the stations from the newspaper effective February 13, 1953. The Raleigh-Durham market's first TV station, WNAO-TV, channel 28, signed on in 1953,<ref>Teresa Leonard, \"TV makes debut in Raleigh,\" ''News & Observer'', July 10, 2013, p. 1B.</ref> but went off the air in 1957. The AM (10,000 watts at 850&nbsp;kHz) and FM (35,000 watts at 96.1&nbsp;MHz) radio stations were sold to an independent broadcaster, Ted Oberfelter, who changed the call letters to WKIX and WKIX-FM to avoid the association with the newspaper.\n\n===WKIX, Channel 85===\nIn 1958, Hugh Holder, a former CBS announcer, bought the radio stations. Holder changed the format from easy listening to [[top 40]] , serving the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill market. Known as \"WKIX, Channel 85\", \"The Giant of the South\", and \"The Mighty 850\", the station was one of the most successful popular music outlets in the US from the late 1950s through the 1970s. It was home to many well-known personalities in North Carolina radio including Tom Scott, Jack Kane, Rich Reim, Mike Reineri (later at WJJD, Chicago), Bob DeBardelaben (later at WRAL-TV), Al Smith, Tommy Woods, Bob Kelly, Bob Jones, Mark Starr, Steve Roddy, the legendary Jimmy Capps (with his syndicated late-night show, \"Our Best to You\");  Dale Van Horn, Pat Patterson, Ron McKay, Mike Mitchell, Mark Mitchell, Bob Bolton, James K.

Chief Engineer, Larry Gardner (who later became CE of WCKY in Cincinnati) was responsible for many technical innovations that provided the distinctive WKIX sound.\n\nFollowing the Holder years, WKIX and WKIX-FM were owned by Belk Broadcasting, Southern Broadcasting, and Mann Media. Previously, the FM signal had mostly duplicated WKIX's programming, getting a boost from the rising popularity of FM and also providing improved full-time coverage of the entire Raleigh-Durham market. As FM became more dominant, the WKIX-FM call sign was changed to WYYD, power was increased to 100,000 watts, and the station was programmed separately as easy-listening.\n\nIn the 1970s, the station had a strong news department, with such icons as: Bill Leslie (now at [[WRAL-TV]] and is also an accomplished musician), Mike Blackmon (who went on to [[WPTF]]), Scott White, Steven Reid, Max Powell, Edward Faircloth, Raymond Caulder, Bill McQuage; Joe Goodpasture,  [[John Tesh]] (who went on to co-host ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and now writes and produces music), Steve Shumake, J.

WKIX became the first significant country station in the Raleigh market, but with competitive pressures it changed to an \"oldies\" format in 1986.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1995 the format was satellite [[adult standards]] with some talk shows and sports programming.
