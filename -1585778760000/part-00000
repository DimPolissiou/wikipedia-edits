Bayugan serves as the growth center of the province.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nLocated at the northern part of Agusan del Sur, Bayugan is the \"cut-flower capital\" of the province owing to its lucrative cut flower industry. The city's climate, especially in the highland barangays, is conducive to high yield cut-flower production. The city is also one of the major producers of rice and vegetables in the province, even providing the needs of neighboring municipalities and provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe natives called the area Bayugan since the word ''bayugan'' is a [[Manobo]] term for pathway. Another version states that ''bayug'' trees used to grow abundantly in the area. It was also believed that the natives used to make this place their meeting spot and that the means of gathering the inhabitants was by knocking on a hollow piece of wood which they termed as the ''bayug''.\n\n==History==\nBayugan City was formerly a sitio of Barangay Maygatasan, [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]].<ref>http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/governance/2011-11-17-16-33-48/2011-08-15-05-52-42/bayugan-city</ref> Several versions abound on how the sitio got its name. First, the place was located along the river which served as the pathway of the natives in going to Esperanza.\n\nIn 1942, Japanese troops entered Bayugan City during the [[World War II|second World War]].\n\nIn 1945, the town of Bayugan in Southern Agusan was liberated by Filipino soldiers and guerrillas from the Japanese forces occupying the town.\n\nIn 1948, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a survey for a [[Pan-Philippine Highway|National Highway]] that would connect [[Butuan]] with [[Davao City]]. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Lands surveyed the places that would be traversed by the proposed road. Possible town sites were identified and among them was Barangay Maygatasan. However, part of the National Highway (now the Narra Avenue) passed through the sitio of Bayugan instead of Barangay Maygatasan. Migrants started settling in the sitio of Bayugan, thus, prompting the transfer of the proposed town site.\n\nIn the early part of 1960, the inhabitants led by Mr. Jose Joson passed a resolution creating the sitio of Bayugan into a regular barrio. In April of that year, Barangay Bayugan was inaugurated with Joson as the Teniente del Barrio. Brought about by the construction of the National Highway which traversed the place, business activity sprouted rapidly in the area.\n\nA year later, barangay officials led by then Sergio Mullaneda worked out the creation of Bayugan into a regular municipality through the assistance of Governor Democrito O. Plaza, Governor of Agusan. By virtue of Executive Order No. 440 of then President Carlos P. Garcia, the petition to create the municipality of Bayugan was granted on August 6, 1961. Mr. Mullaneda, the first appointed Municipal Mayor of Bayugan assumed into office on August 6, 1962 during the term of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. In the year 2007 Bayugan was converted to a city.\n\nBayugan is a transportation highway nexus for the eastern part of [[Mindanao]] Island. Bayugan is now one if not the fastest growing component city in North Eastern [[Mindanao]].\n\n===Cityhood===\n{{Main|League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC}}\n\nOn July 24, 2006, congress approved R.A. 9405, an act converting the Municipality of Bayugan into a component city to be known as the City of Bayugan.\n\nBut in 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the law unconstitutional. The court ruled that Bayugan, along with the other fifteen cities covered by the law did not meet the requirements for cityhood.\n\nMore than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting favorably on the appeal of the sixteen affected cities, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling. It deemed that the passage of the amendatory law regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress specifically exempting a particular political subdivision therefrom was constitutional. The court further ruled that congress, in enacting the exempting law, effectively decreased the already codified indicators. As such, the cityhood status of Bayugan, and the rest of the fifteen local government units was restored.\n\nBut again on August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision striking down the constitutionality of Republic Act 9405. Voting 7\u20136, with two justices abstaining, the SC reinstated its decision declaring RA 9405 as unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, in another twist of fate for Bayugan, the Supreme Court once again upheld for the 3rd time and final time the constitutionality of RA 9405 on February 17, 2011, thereby finalizing the cityhood of Bayugan and the other fifteen LGUs affected by the law.  On July 3, 2011, the Supreme Court ordered its Clerk of Court to issue an entry of judgment on the cityhood case, sealing with finality the constitutionality of the law.\n<ref>Republic Act 9405</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nBayugan is bordered by the Municipality of [[Sibagat, Agusan del Sur|Sibagat]] and the province of [[Surigao del Sur]] to the north; the Municipality of [[Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur|Prosperidad]] to the east; the Municipality of [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]] to the south; and the Municipality of [[Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte]], to the west.\n\n===Climate===\nThe city is geographically situated below the typhoon belt but is usually affected by depressions forming in the typhoon regions of Visayas and the province of Surigao del Norte. The climate map of the Philippines based on the modified coronas classification shows that the city falls under Type II. Which also is the weather classification of the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nType II climate has no dry season with very pronounced wet season of heavy precipitation. Maximum rainfall generally occurs from December to January although there is no single dry month. Its average monthly rainfall is {{Convert|161.6|mm}} and average temperature is {{Convert|32|C}}.

Bayugan serves as the growth center of the province.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nLocated at the northern part of Agusan del Sur, Bayugan is the \"cut-flower capital\" of the province owing to its lucrative cut flower industry. The city's climate, especially in the highland barangays, is conducive to high yield cut-flower production. The city is also one of the major producers of rice and vegetables in the province, even providing the needs of neighboring municipalities and provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe natives called the area Bayugan since the word ''bayugan'' is a [[Manobo]] term for pathway. Another version states that ''bayug'' trees used to grow abundantly in the area. It was also believed that the natives used to make this place their meeting spot and that the means of gathering the inhabitants was by knocking on a hollow piece of wood which they termed as the ''bayug''.\n\n==History==\nBayugan City was formerly a sitio of Barangay Maygatasan, [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]].<ref>http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/governance/2011-11-17-16-33-48/2011-08-15-05-52-42/bayugan-city</ref> Several versions abound on how the sitio got its name. First, the place was located along the river which served as the pathway of the natives in going to Esperanza.\n\nIn 1942, Japanese troops entered Bayugan City during the [[World War II|second World War]].\n\nIn 1945, the town of Bayugan in Southern Agusan was liberated by Filipino soldiers and guerrillas from the Japanese forces occupying the town.\n\nIn 1948, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a survey for a [[Pan-Philippine Highway|National Highway]] that would connect [[Butuan]] with [[Davao City]]. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Lands surveyed the places that would be traversed by the proposed road. Possible town sites were identified and among them was Barangay Maygatasan. However, part of the National Highway (now the Narra Avenue) passed through the sitio of Bayugan instead of Barangay Maygatasan. Migrants started settling in the sitio of Bayugan, thus, prompting the transfer of the proposed town site.\n\nIn the early part of 1960, the inhabitants led by Mr. Jose Joson passed a resolution creating the sitio of Bayugan into a regular barrio. In April of that year, Barangay Bayugan was inaugurated with Joson as the Teniente del Barrio. Brought about by the construction of the National Highway which traversed the place, business activity sprouted rapidly in the area.\n\nA year later, barangay officials led by then Sergio Mullaneda worked out the creation of Bayugan into a regular municipality through the assistance of Governor Democrito O. Plaza, Governor of Agusan. By virtue of Executive Order No. 440 of then President Carlos P. Garcia, the petition to create the municipality of Bayugan was granted on August 6, 1961. Mr. Mullaneda, the first appointed Municipal Mayor of Bayugan assumed into office on August 6, 1962 during the term of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. In the year 2007 Bayugan was converted to a city.\n\nBayugan is a transportation highway nexus for the eastern part of [[Mindanao]] Island. Bayugan is now one if not the fastest growing component city in North Eastern [[Mindanao]].\n\n===Cityhood===\n{{Main|League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC}}\n\nOn July 24, 2006, congress approved R.A. 9405, an act converting the Municipality of Bayugan into a component city to be known as the City of Bayugan.\n\nBut in 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the law unconstitutional. The court ruled that Bayugan, along with the other fifteen cities covered by the law did not meet the requirements for cityhood.\n\nMore than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting favorably on the appeal of the sixteen affected cities, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling. It deemed that the passage of the amendatory law regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress specifically exempting a particular political subdivision therefrom was constitutional. The court further ruled that congress, in enacting the exempting law, effectively decreased the already codified indicators. As such, the cityhood status of Bayugan, and the rest of the fifteen local government units was restored.\n\nBut again on August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision striking down the constitutionality of Republic Act 9405. Voting 7-6, with two justices abstaining, the SC reinstated its decision declaring RA 9405 as unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, in another twist of fate for Bayugan, the Supreme Court once again upheld for the 3rd time and final time the constitutionality of RA 9405 on February 17, 2011, thereby finalizing the cityhood of Bayugan and the other fifteen LGUs affected by the law.  On July 3, 2011, the Supreme Court ordered its Clerk of Court to issue an entry of judgment on the cityhood case, sealing with finality the constitutionality of the law.\n<ref>Republic Act 9405</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nBayugan is bordered by the Municipality of [[Sibagat, Agusan del Sur|Sibagat]] and the province of [[Surigao del Sur]] to the north; the Municipality of [[Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur|Prosperidad]] to the east; the Municipality of [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]] to the south; and the Municipality of [[Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte]], to the west.\n\n===Climate===\nThe city is geographically situated below the typhoon belt but is usually affected by depressions forming in the typhoon regions of Visayas and the province of Surigao del Norte. The climate map of the Philippines based on the modified coronas classification shows that the city falls under Type II. Which also is the weather classification of the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nType II climate has no dry season with very pronounced wet season of heavy precipitation. Maximum rainfall generally occurs from December to January although there is no single dry month. Its average monthly rainfall is {{Convert|161.6|mm}} and average temperature is {{Convert|32|C}}.

Today nearly 2200 people live in R\u00fdnovice.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rynovicekostel.jpg|thumb|left|Holy Spirit church in R\u00fdnovice]]\nThe first written mention of R\u00fdnovice, or Reinowitz, is from 1559, but the village may be older. Until the end of [[World War II]] the village was inhabited mainly by [[ethnic Germans]]. The town was known for suffering through frequent fires that may have been related to the large amount of foreign troop movements that it saw during the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Napoleonic wars]] and the [[Austro-Prussian War]].\n\nThe dominant Reinowitz Holy Ghost church dates from 1697-8 and was renovated in 1882 and 1995.  Roads joining Reinowitz with the towns of [[Wemschen]], [[Luxdorf]] and [[Reichenberg (Bohemia)|Reichenberg]] were built in 1852. The cemetery was dominated by the Priebsch family tomb from 1862\u20134. In 1900, the village was connected to the tram network of [[Gablonz an der Nei\u00dfe]].

Until the end of [[World War II]] the village was inhabited mainly by [[ethnic Germans]]. The town was known for suffering through frequent fires that may have been related to the large amount of foreign troop movements that it saw during the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Napoleonic wars]] and the [[Austro-Prussian War]].\n\nThe dominant Reinowitz Holy Ghost church dates from 1697-8 and was renovated in 1882 and 1995.  Roads joining Reinowitz with the towns of [[Wemschen]], [[Luxdorf]] and [[Reichenberg (Bohemia)|Reichenberg]] were built in 1852. The cemetery was dominated by the Priebsch family tomb from 1862\u20134. In 1900, the village was connected to the tram network of [[Gablonz an der Nei\u00dfe]].  In 1910, Reinowitz was home to nearly 1150 people.\n\nThe [[Munich Agreement]] permitted Nazi Germany's [[Adolf Hitler]] to annex the area, in 1938, into what he called the [[Sudetenland]].  There were several small glass works and brickworks. Just before the war began a complex of factories were built, which today is an industrial zone in the town of [[Jablonec nad Nisou]].

The first of these was Goose Creek, named for the bayou of the same name where [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] wintered and whose name is still reflected in the area's [[Goose Creek Consolidated Independent School District|Goose Creek school district]], whose establishment dates back to before 1850.

However, in 1947, the three cities finally agreed to consolidate. The citizens settled on the name Baytown for the new combined city. Baytown as it is known today was officially founded January 24, 1948.<ref name=\"TSHA\"/>\n\nIn 1916, the [[Humble Oil and Refining Company]], founded by one-time Texas governor [[Ross S.

The company later built the [[Baytown Refinery]], which would become one of the largest Exxon refineries in the world. Since then, many other refineries have been built in the area. [[Exxon-Mobil]] is still one of the major employers in the city and now runs over 10 plants in the area including a newly announced 2 billion dollar expansion to its chemical facilities in 2019.\n\nFollowing the discovery of oil nearby, the population of Baytown and the Tri-Cities boomed.
