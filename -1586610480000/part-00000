The [[Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York]] (PBA) filed a lawsuit to secure benefits for Officer Christopher Hynes, 36. In March 2004 he was diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. However, the NYPD has refused to bestow line-of-duty injury status to him. Hynes had worked for 111 hours at Ground Zero and its vicinity. He claims that he was never given a proper respirator for his work at Ground Zero. He has had difficulty in paying medical bills because of the denial of line-of-duty status. One medical provider sued him for $3,094 for medical bills. The provider eventually settled out of court for $1,625. The PBA noted that firefighters, by contrast, have been given line-of-duty status for their injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |title=PBA SUES TO BOO$T '9/11 AIR VICTIM' {{!}} By DAVID SEIFMAN {{!}} New York News {{!}} New York City News {{!}} NY News |date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2016-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152919/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |title=NY1: Law Enforcement |date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2016-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002945/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Various volunteers===\nHundreds of volunteer firefighters, construction workers, health professionals, clergy, and other individuals descended upon the scene in the days immediately following the attacks.

The [[Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York]] (PBA) filed a lawsuit to secure benefits for Officer Christopher Hynes, 36. In March 2004 he was diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. However, the NYPD has refused to bestow line-of-duty injury status to him. Hynes had worked for 111 hours at Ground Zero and its vicinity. He claims that he was never given a proper respirator for his work at Ground Zero. He has had difficulty in paying medical bills because of the denial of line-of-duty status. One medical provider sued him for $3,094 for medical bills. The provider eventually settled out of court for $1,625. The PBA noted that firefighters, by contrast, have been given line-of-duty status for their injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |title=PBA SUES TO BOO$T '9/11 AIR VICTIM' {{!}} By DAVID SEIFMAN {{!}} New York News {{!}} New York City News {{!}} NY News |date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2016-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152919/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |title=NY1: Law Enforcement |date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2016-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002945/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Various volunteers===\nHundreds of volunteer firefighters, construction workers, health professionals, clergy, and other individuals descended upon the scene in the days immediately following the attacks.

It reaffirmed and extended the doctrine of [[estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]] in [[contract law]] in [[England and Wales]]. However, the most significant part of the judgment is ''[[obiter dicta]]'' as it relates to hypothetical facts; that is, the landlord did '''not''' seek repayment of the full wartime rent.\n\n[[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning J]] held estoppel to be applicable if\n\n{{quote|text= a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on.}}\n\n==Facts==\nHigh Trees House Ltd leased a [[Apartment|block of flats]] in [[Clapham]], [[London]] from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual [[ground rent]] of \u00a32,500. The outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to \u00a31,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no [[Consideration in English law|consideration]] was provided. \n\nBy 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of \u00a32,500 and claiming arrears of \u00a37,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two [[Fiscal year|quarters]] which had elapsed since June 1945.\n\n==Judgment==\nBased on previous judgments as ''[[Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co]]'', Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an ''[[obiter]]'' statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being ''[[obiter dicta]]'' and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of [[promissory estoppel]].\n\n{{quote|text=If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the law, there is no doubt that had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of \u00a32,500 a year from the beginning of the term, since the lease under which it was payable was a lease under seal which, according to the old common law, could not be varied by an agreement by parol (whether in writing or not), but only by deed. Equity, however stepped in, and said that if there has been a variation of a deed by a simple contract (which in the case of a lease required to be in writing would have to be evidenced by writing), the courts may give effect to it as is shown in ''[[Berry v. Berry]]'' [1929] 2 K. B. 316. That equitable doctrine, however, could hardly apply in the present case because the variation here might be said to have been made without consideration. With regard to estoppel, the representation made in relation to reducing the rent was not a representation of an existing fact. It was a representation, in effect, as to the future, namely, that payment of the rent would not be enforced at the full rate but only at the reduced rate. Such a representation would not give rise to an estoppel, because, as was said in ''[[Jorden v. Money]]'' (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185, a representation as to the future must be embodied as a contract or be nothing.\n\nBut what is the position in view of developments in the law in recent years? The law has not been standing still since ''[[Jorden v. Money]]'' (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185. There has been a series of decisions over the last fifty years which, although they are said to be cases of estoppel are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the promise must be honoured. The cases to which I particularly desire to refer are: ''[[Fenner v. Blake]]'' [1900] 1 Q. B. 426, ''[[In re Wickham]]'' (1917) 34 T. L. R. 158, ''[[Re William Porter & Co., Ld.]]'' [1937] 2 All E. R. 361 and ''[[Buttery v. Pickard]]'' [1946] W. N. 25. As I have said they are not cases of estoppel in the strict sense. They are really promises - promises intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on. ''[[Jorden v. Money]]'' (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185 can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it clear that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound. In each case the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It is in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gives rise to an estoppel. The decisions are a natural result of the fusion of law and equity: for the cases of ''[[Hughes v. Metropolitan Ry. Co.]]'' (1877) 2 App. Cas. 439 , 448, ''[[Birmingham and District Land Co. v. London & North Western Ry. Co.]]'' (1888) 40 Ch. D. 268 , 286 and ''[[Salisbury (Marquess) v. Gilmore]]'' [1942] 2 K. B. 38 , 51, afford a sufficient basis for saying that a party would not be allowed in equity to go back on such a promise. In my opinion, the time has now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognized. The logical consequence, no doubt is that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the better. That aspect was not considered in ''[[Foakes v. Beer]]'' (1884) 9 App. Cas. 605. At this time of day however, when law and equity have been joined together for over seventy years, principles must be reconsidered in the light of their combined effect. It is to be noticed that in the Sixth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee, pars. 35, 40, it is recommended that such a promise as that to which I have referred should be enforceable in law even though no consideration for it has been given by the promisee. It seems to me that, to the extent I have mentioned, that result has now been achieved by the decisions of the courts.\n\nI am satisfied that a promise such as that to which I have referred is binding and the only question remaining for my consideration is the scope of the promise in the present case. I am satisfied on all the evidence that the promise here was that the ground rent should be reduced to \u00a31,250 a year as a temporary expedient while the block of flats was not fully, or substantially fully let, owing to the conditions prevailing. That means that the reduction in the rent applied throughout the years down to the end of 1944, but early in 1945 it is plain that the flats were fully let, and, indeed the rents received from them (many of them not being affected by the Rent Restrictions Acts), were increased beyond the figure at which it was originally contemplated that they would be let. At all events the rent from them must have been very considerable. I find that the conditions prevailing at the time when the reduction in rent was made, had completely passed away by the early months of 1945. I am satisfied that the promise was understood by all parties only to apply under the conditions prevailing at the time when it was made, namely, when the flats were only partially let, and that it did not extend any further than that. When the flats became fully let, early in 1945, the reduction ceased to apply.\n\nIn those circumstances, under the law as I hold it, it seems to me that rent is payable at the full rate for the quarters ending September 29 and  December 25, 1945.\n\nIf the case had been one of estoppel, it might be said that in any event the estoppel would cease when the conditions to which the representation applied came to an end, or it also might be said that it would only come to an end on notice. In either case it is only a way of ascertaining what is the scope of the representation. I prefer to apply the principle that a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply. Here it was binding as covering the period down to the early part of 1945, and as from that time full rent is payable.\n\nI therefore give judgment for the plaintiff company for the amount claimed.}}\n\n==Significance==\nAdvances have been made in promissory estoppel since its inception in ''High Trees'' to create a new inroad into the rule in ''[[Pinnel's case]]'' that an agreement to accept part payment of a debt in full satisfaction of it is unenforceable for want of consideration. Denning commented that such an agreement should now be enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and indeed the plaintiff did not seek the full debt on the basis of what was fair and, perhaps, thought was the law. However, the courts were at first reluctant to overrule or distinguish cases like ''Pinnel's case'' and ''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' having formed part of the common law for so long.

It reaffirmed and extended the doctrine of [[estoppel#Promissory estoppel 2|promissory estoppel]] in [[contract law]] in [[England and Wales]]. However, the most significant part of the judgment is ''[[obiter dicta]]'' as it relates to hypothetical facts; that is, the landlord did '''not''' seek repayment of the full wartime rent.\n\n[[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning J]] held estoppel to be applicable if\n\n{{quote|text= a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on.}}\n\n==Facts==\nHigh Trees House Ltd leased a [[Apartment|block of flats]] in [[Clapham]], [[London]] from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual [[ground rent]] of \u00a32,500. The outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered.

From 1939 to 1981, this activity had affected 39% of the area of the current national park. The park also has its own cultural heritage. Its history as an English resort, hunting and fishing with the Murray River fishing Club, also called Club La Roche, a former private fishing club adds to the history of logging and dredging that took place in the park before its creation.<ref>{{cite web|langue=|title=Portrait of the park|url=https://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/decouverte/portrait.dot|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=December 4, 2016}}</ref>.\n\nGrands-Jardins National Park protects an environment that is highly representative of the natural region of the [[Jacques-Cartier Lake Massif]].<ref name=\"mfpp\">{{cite web|title=Grands Jardins National Park - Minist\u00e8re des Forests, Wildlife and Parks|url=http://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/parcs/reseau-parcs-nationaux/fiches/grands-jardins.jsp|website=mffp.gouv.qc.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> The natural environment of the park is dominated by forests and approximately 30% of the park was ravaged by a [[forest fire]] in 1991 then in 1999.

Three distinct habitat types can be observed in the park: young forests which were created by natural fires and logging, mature forests composed of black spruce and balsam fir with closed cover and taiga reminiscent of the Great Northern Quebec. Taiga environments similar to that of Grands-Jardins National Park are normally found more than {{convert|500|km}} further north, above the 52th parallel. These different habitats make it possible to shelter a variety of animals, some of which have threatened or vulnerable status. We find in particular populations of [[Alces|moose]], [[reindeer|woodland caribou]], [[bear|black bear]], [[red fox]], [[pig-spicy]], [[common loon]], [[Canada grouse]], [[Wolf (mammal)|wolves]], several [[lynx]] and several other species.\n\nDue to the diversity of habitats found within the national park, several species frequent the latter, including three species that are classified as vulnerable, namely the [[woodland caribou]] of the forest ecotype, the [[Bicknell's thrush]] and [[Barrow's Goldeneye|Barrow's Goldeneye]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These species have the most serious status under the Quebec Act on threatened or vulnerable species.

We thus find the following mammals: several species of shrews (the great shrew, the common shrew, sooty, palustrine and pygmy), the condylure with a star nose, the snowshoe hare, the red squirrel, the large polatouche, the marmot common, Canada beaver, several species of voles (red-backed Gapper, fields, rocks, Cooper's lemming), phenacomys, muskrat, some species of mouse (deer, wood jumping and field jumping ), American porcupine, coyote, gray wolf, red fox, black bear, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, stoat, river otter, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, American marten, American mink, striped skunk, cougar and Canadian lynx.<ref> {{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - mammals|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27312.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date= 2 decembre 2016}}</ref>.

In addition, it feeds on several plants and shrubs in the boreal forest.\n\nThe woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a mammal very sensitive to the presence of humans. Too large a presence on its territory can disturb the species and modify its behavior and lead it to frequent places less favorable for the species, making the caribou more vulnerable to its predators such as the wolf and the black bear. The territory of the Grands-Jardins Park is an important environment for the calving, rutting and winter feeding of the woodland caribou and plays a decisive role in the conservation of the species.<ref> {{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault, C., Banville D.|title=The situation of forest caribou in Quebec|periodical=The Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001 Volume 125 num. ro 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref> It lives in particular in mature coniferous forests where arboreal lichens are very present.\n\nThe [[black bear]], an omnivorous animal whose diet consists mainly of plants, is [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ours.html abundant in the national park]. However, it also feeds on fawns that are easy prey for bears when they venture out of the dense forest. The bear prefers open and semi-open sites where the vegetation constituting a good part of its diet is more abundant and rarely ventures into the dense forest of the park.\n\nThe [[Canadian lynx]] (Lynx canadensis) is a wild feline from the boreal forest that lives in varied habitats dominated by mature stand forests. It is one of the three wild felines that live in Canada with the bobcat to which it resembles much and the cougar<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The lynx of Canada|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lynx-du-canada.html|site=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>. This carnivore feeds mainly on snowshoe hares that are found in the park. Thus the Grands-Jardins National Park is a suitable habitat for this species. On the other hand, it is a shy and secretive feline since it is rarely observed.\n\nThe [[Cooper's vole-lemming|Cooper's lemming vole]] (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small rodent that frequents wetlands.<ref>DESROSIERS, N., R.

Its presence indicates good health of the lakes it frequents. The golden eagle, meanwhile, lives in rock walls and open or semi-open environments. The [[Peregrine Falcon]] also lives in the rock faces and open spaces of the national park. The black-backed woodpecker plays an important role in burnt forests since it creates cavities in dead trees in order to feed on the insects that adore this environment. The cavities thus created are then used for several species. The [[Bicknell's Thrush]] which is a forest bird prefers rather dense and regenerating forests as habitat.<ref>{{cite article|language=English|author1=Chisholm SE et Leonard ML|title=Effect of forest management on rare habitat specialist, the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli)|periodical=NRC Canada|date=2008|issn=|read online=|pages=217-223}}</ref>.

This is why we find there forest habitats which dominate the landscape, open habitats, taiga habitats composed mainly of lichens as well as varied aquatic habitats. The park helps protect a site of exceptional character that are cladonia spruces, a sample of taiga which is unique for southern Quebec. This type of habitat is normally found further north in Quebec.<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These different types of habitats are home to a wide variety of plants from four different categories: heather, lichen, bog and trees.\n\nAbout fifteen species of the heather family are [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ericacees.html observable in the park]. Their flowering extends from the beginning of June until the end of the summer. One of the most easily observable flowers is probably the narrow-leaved Kalmia (Kalmia augustifolia) which has pink saucer-shaped flowers. The park is also home to [[Labrador tea]] (Rhododendron groenlandicum), a few varieties of [cranberry] (Vaccinium sp.) That produce blueberries and cranberries, the [[Moneses uniflora|pirole with one flower]] (Moneses uniflora), [[Gaultheria|wintergreen]] Hispid (Gaultheria hispidula), [[Glaucous Andromeda]] (Andromeda polifolia var. Glaucophylla) and [[Chamaedaphne calyculata|Caliculated Cassandra]] (Chamaedaphne calyculata). [[File: Boreal Flora.jpg|left|thumbnail|Lichens cladoni|alt=|293x293px]] A second family of plants is very abundant in the park, that of the lichen which is represented in the Parc des Grands-Jardins by 200 different species. Different species colonize different parts of the park. Some lichens are more adapted to the soil while others colonize trees or rock walls. There are different species of crustacean and foliaceous lichens that grow mainly on rocks in the Bear Mountains and Swan Lake. Lichens of the Bryoria and Usnea type are found on mature trees in the boreal forest. Finally, fruticulous lichens of the genus Cladoni grow directly on the ground. Lichens are an important component of the ecosystem since they are the main source of food for certain species, especially for woodland caribou in winter.<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault C. and Banville D.|title=The situation of the woodland caribou in Quebec|periodical = The Canadian naturalist|date=autumn 2001 volume 125 number 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref>\n\nTwo remarkable peat bogs are present on the territory of the national park. These are rare habitats for southern Quebec. The first peatland is the permafrost of Mont de l'ours and the second is the reticulated peatland of Lac Malbaie.\n\nThe trees in the park are mainly [[Black spruce|black spruce]] and [[Balsam fir|balsam fir]] which are similar to the Canadian boreal forest. There are also larches and jack pines. The boreal forest, which is found in the national park, is dominated by conifers which are particularly well adapted to the harsh boreal climate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The Canadian boreal forest|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/espaces-sauvages/la-foret-boreale-canadienne.html|site=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>.

The second is that of characterizing the emergence of insects on lakes. The third is the restoration of borrow pits abandoned since 2007, led by the team of Line Rochefort of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences at Laval University. The goal of the project is to accelerate the vegetal restoration of the borrow pits of the park created by the extraction of sand and gravel which have been abandoned for 40 years. The park is also the subject of a project to modify the park boundary<ref>Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, National Parks Directorate. Undated. ''Information document, Project to modify the boundary of Grands-Jardins National Park''. [pdf] 28 p.</ref> in order to enlarge it and incorporate an interesting area for the conservation of five new peaks, six lakes and the habitat of the woodland caribou<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>. The park team has also been carrying out a monitoring of the loon's nesting since 2007 and invites visitors to share their observations of the bird via observation sheets.\n\nOne of the main goals of the national park is the conservation of the natural environments of the Charlevoix region and the species that inhabit it. The protection of aquatic environments and peaks are major issues for Grands-Jardins National Park. Rigorous monitoring of fishing quotas, identification of spawning grounds and characterization of numerous water bodies allow the park to minimize the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and promote a favorable environment for the populations of Arctic char and d brook trout that depend on it. Marked trails and awareness of hikers reduce the anthropogenic impact on the fragile ecosystems of mountain peaks.\n\n==References==\n:''This article was initially translated from the French Wikipedia.''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Autres projets|commons=Category:Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], an unorganized territory\n* [[Malbaie River]]\n* [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]]\n* [[Sainte-Anne River (Beaupr\u00e9)]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re du Chemin des Canots]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re de l'Enfer]]\n* [[Lac Sainte-Anne du Nord]]\n* [[Malbaie Pond]]\n* [[National Parks of Quebec]]\n* [[National Parks of Canada]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [http://www.bonjourquebec.com/qc-fr/repertoire-attraits/parc-national-du-quebec/parc-national-des-grands-jardins_1931513.html  Parc national des Grands-Jardins]\n*[http://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/index.dot Grands-Jardins National Park] - official site\n* {{fr}} [http://biospherecharlevoix.com/ Site officiel de la R\u00e9serve mondiale de la Biosph\u00e8re de Charlevoix-UNESCO]\n\n{{Protected Areas of Quebec}}\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n[[Category:National parks of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Important Bird Areas of Canada]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Capitale-Nationale]]\n\n{{Quebec-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name =  Grands-Jardins National Park\n| iucn_category = II\n| photo = Parc national des Grands-Jardins.jpg\n| photo_caption =\n| location = [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, Quebec|Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]\n| nearest_city = [[Baie-Saint-Paul]]\n| coordinates = {{coords|47|41|N|70|51|W|display=inline, title}}\n| area =\n| established =\n| visitation_num =\n| visitation_year =\n| governing_body =\n}}\n'''Grands-Jardins National Park''' is a [[provincial park]], located in the Unorganized Territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], in the [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]], in administrative region of [[Capitale-Nationale]], in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aires_protegees/registre/reg-design/17Parc-nationalquebec.pdf Registre des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es du Qu\u00e9bec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212162228/http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aires_protegees/registre/reg-design/17Parc-nationalquebec.pdf |date=2013-12-12 }}, Minist\u00e8re du D\u00e9veloppement durable, de l\u2019Environnement et des Parcs. {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nThe Grands-Jardins National Park is a protected area for the conservation of the natural heritage of the Charlevoix region in which certain human activities are permitted.

We find in particular populations of [[Alces|moose]], [[reindeer|woodland caribou]], [[bear|black bear]], [[red fox]], [[pig-spicy]], [[common loon]], [[Canada grouse]], [[Wolf (mammal)|wolves]], several [[lynx]] and several other species.\n\nDue to the diversity of habitats found within the national park, several species frequent the latter, including three species that are classified as vulnerable, namely the [[woodland caribou]] of the forest ecotype, the [[Bicknell's thrush]] and [[Barrow's Goldeneye|Barrow's Goldeneye]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These species have the most serious status under the Quebec Act on threatened or vulnerable species. There are also seven species likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable, namely [[arctic char]], [[golden eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Common nighthawk America|nightjar of America]]<nowiki/>, [[chimney swift]], [[rock vole]], [[cougar]] and [[Cooper vole-lemming]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>{{,}}<ref>{{cite article|langue=French|author1=Lepage, M.|title=Threatened or vulnerable vertebrate fauna in the boreal forest|periodical=Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001, volume 125, number 3|issn =|read online=|pages= 131-137}}</ref> The park is obviously home to several species of mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects.\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nThe mammal category includes as many large mammals as small rodents, moving from moose to bear and porcupine. We thus find the following mammals: several species of shrews (the great shrew, the common shrew, sooty, palustrine and pygmy), the condylure with a star nose, the snowshoe hare, the red squirrel, the large polatouche, the marmot common, Canada beaver, several species of voles (red-backed Gapper, fields, rocks, Cooper's lemming), phenacomys, muskrat, some species of mouse (deer, wood jumping and field jumping ), American porcupine, coyote, gray wolf, red fox, black bear, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, stoat, river otter, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, American marten, American mink, striped skunk, cougar and Canadian lynx.<ref> {{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - mammals|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27312.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date= 2 decembre 2016}}</ref>. This is explained by the varied habitats offered by the vast territory of the Grands-Jardins National Park.\n\n[[File: Snowshoe Hare, Shirleys Bay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Snowshoe hare]].]]\n\nThe [[Snowshoe hare|snowshoe hare]] is one of the most important species in the park (and even in Canada) from an ecological point of view<ref>{{cite web|title=Faune et flora of the country - The snowshoe hare|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lievre-d-amerique.html|site=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>, because it represents a food source for a good number of predators which frequent the national park and the boreal forest in general such as the Canada lynx, the red fox and the coyote. In addition, it feeds on several plants and shrubs in the boreal forest.\n\nThe woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a mammal very sensitive to the presence of humans. Too large a presence on its territory can disturb the species and modify its behavior and lead it to frequent places less favorable for the species, making the caribou more vulnerable to its predators such as the wolf and the black bear. The territory of the Grands-Jardins Park is an important environment for the calving, rutting and winter feeding of the woodland caribou and plays a decisive role in the conservation of the species.<ref> {{Article|langue=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault, C., Banville D.|title=The situation of forest caribou in Quebec|periodical=The Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001 Volume 125 num. ro 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref> It lives in particular in mature coniferous forests where arboreal lichens are very present.\n\nThe [[black bear]], an omnivorous animal whose diet consists mainly of plants, is [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ours.html abundant in the national park]. However, it also feeds on fawns that are easy prey for bears when they venture out of the dense forest. The bear prefers open and semi-open sites where the vegetation constituting a good part of its diet is more abundant and rarely ventures into the dense forest of the park.\n\nThe [[Canadian lynx]] (Lynx canadensis) is a wild feline from the boreal forest that lives in varied habitats dominated by mature stand forests. It is one of the three wild felines that live in Canada with the bobcat to which it resembles much and the cougar<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The lynx of Canada|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lynx-du-canada.html|site=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>. This carnivore feeds mainly on snowshoe hares that are found in the park. Thus the Grands-Jardins National Park is a suitable habitat for this species. On the other hand, it is a shy and secretive feline since it is rarely observed.\n\nThe [[Cooper's vole-lemming|Cooper's lemming vole]] (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small rodent that frequents wetlands.<ref>DESROSIERS, N., R.

The [[common loon]], [[golden eagle]], [[black-backed woodpecker]], [[Barrow's Goldeneye]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[thrush Bicknell]] and [[Canada grouse]] are a small, non-exhaustive list.<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - birds|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27314.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe common loon, a skilled diver, lives in fish-rich lakes since it is a great predator of aquatic environments. Its presence indicates good health of the lakes it frequents. The golden eagle, meanwhile, lives in rock walls and open or semi-open environments. The [[Peregrine Falcon]] also lives in the rock faces and open spaces of the national park. The black-backed woodpecker plays an important role in burnt forests since it creates cavities in dead trees in order to feed on the insects that adore this environment. The cavities thus created are then used for several species. The [[Bicknell's Thrush]] which is a forest bird prefers rather dense and regenerating forests as habitat.<ref>{{cite article|language=English|author1=Chisholm SE et Leonard ML|title=Effect of forest management on rare habitat specialist, the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli)|periodical=NRC Canada|date=2008|issn=|read online=|pages=217-223}}</ref>.

Among the amphibians, we find the [[two-line salamander]], [[American toad|American toad]], [[cruciferous tree frog]], [[wood frog]], [[Pelophylax kl. esculentus|green frog]], the [[northern frog]] and finally the [[striped snake]].<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - amphibians and reptiles|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27310.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date= December 2, 2016}}.</ref> Arctic char and [[brook trout]] are two species of fish that frequent the national park.\n\n== Flora ==\n[[File: Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill.jpg|thumb|Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill]] The park is made up of different habitats due to its diverse topography, going from high mountains to large lakes. This is why we find there forest habitats which dominate the landscape, open habitats, taiga habitats composed mainly of lichens as well as varied aquatic habitats. The park helps protect a site of exceptional character that are cladonia spruces, a sample of taiga which is unique for southern Quebec. This type of habitat is normally found further north in Quebec.<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These different types of habitats are home to a wide variety of plants from four different categories: heather, lichen, bog and trees.\n\nAbout fifteen species of the heather family are [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ericacees.html observable in the park]. Their flowering extends from the beginning of June until the end of the summer. One of the most easily observable flowers is probably the narrow-leaved Kalmia (Kalmia augustifolia) which has pink saucer-shaped flowers. The park is also home to [[Labrador tea]] (Rhododendron groenlandicum), a few varieties of [cranberry] (Vaccinium sp.) That produce blueberries and cranberries, the [[Moneses uniflora|pirole with one flower]] (Moneses uniflora), [[Gaultheria|wintergreen]] Hispid (Gaultheria hispidula), [[Glaucous Andromeda]] (Andromeda polifolia var. Glaucophylla) and [[Chamaedaphne calyculata|Caliculated Cassandra]] (Chamaedaphne calyculata). [[File: Boreal Flora.jpg|left|thumbnail|Lichens cladoni|alt=|293x293px]] A second family of plants is very abundant in the park, that of the lichen which is represented in the Parc des Grands-Jardins by 200 different species. Different species colonize different parts of the park. Some lichens are more adapted to the soil while others colonize trees or rock walls. There are different species of crustacean and foliaceous lichens that grow mainly on rocks in the Bear Mountains and Swan Lake. Lichens of the Bryoria and Usnea type are found on mature trees in the boreal forest. Finally, fruticulous lichens of the genus Cladoni grow directly on the ground. Lichens are an important component of the ecosystem since they are the main source of food for certain species, especially for woodland caribou in winter.<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault C. and Banville D.|title=The situation of the woodland caribou in Quebec|periodical = The Canadian naturalist|date=autumn 2001 volume 125 number 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref>\n\nTwo remarkable peat bogs are present on the territory of the national park. These are rare habitats for southern Quebec. The first peatland is the permafrost of Mont de l'ours and the second is the reticulated peatland of Lac Malbaie.\n\nThe trees in the park are mainly [[Black spruce|black spruce]] and [[Balsam fir|balsam fir]] which are similar to the Canadian boreal forest. There are also larches and jack pines. The boreal forest, which is found in the national park, is dominated by conifers which are particularly well adapted to the harsh boreal climate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The Canadian boreal forest|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/espaces-sauvages/la-foret-boreale-canadienne.html|site=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>.

The second is that of characterizing the emergence of insects on lakes. The third is the restoration of borrow pits abandoned since 2007, led by the team of Line Rochefort of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences at Laval University. The goal of the project is to accelerate the vegetal restoration of the borrow pits of the park created by the extraction of sand and gravel which have been abandoned for 40 years. The park is also the subject of a project to modify the park boundary<ref>Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, National Parks Directorate. Undated. ''Information document, Project to modify the boundary of Grands-Jardins National Park''. [pdf] 28 p.</ref> in order to enlarge it and incorporate an interesting area for the conservation of five new peaks, six lakes and the habitat of the woodland caribou<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>. The park team has also been carrying out a monitoring of the loon's nesting since 2007 and invites visitors to share their observations of the bird via observation sheets.\n\nOne of the main goals of the national park is the conservation of the natural environments of the Charlevoix region and the species that inhabit it. The protection of aquatic environments and peaks are major issues for Grands-Jardins National Park. Rigorous monitoring of fishing quotas, identification of spawning grounds and characterization of numerous water bodies allow the park to minimize the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and promote a favorable environment for the populations of Arctic char and d brook trout that depend on it. Marked trails and awareness of hikers reduce the anthropogenic impact on the fragile ecosystems of mountain peaks.\n\n==References==\n:''This article was initially translated from the French Wikipedia.''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Autres projets|commons=Category:Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], an unorganized territory\n* [[Malbaie River]]\n* [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]]\n* [[Sainte-Anne River (Beaupr\u00e9)]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re du Chemin des Canots]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re de l'Enfer]]\n* [[Lac Sainte-Anne du Nord]]\n* [[Malbaie Pond]]\n* [[National Parks of Quebec]]\n* [[National Parks of Canada]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [http://www.bonjourquebec.com/qc-fr/repertoire-attraits/parc-national-du-quebec/parc-national-des-grands-jardins_1931513.html  Parc national des Grands-Jardins]\n*[http://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/index.dot Grands-Jardins National Park] - official site\n* {{fr}} [http://biospherecharlevoix.com/ Site officiel de la R\u00e9serve mondiale de la Biosph\u00e8re de Charlevoix-UNESCO]\n\n{{Protected Areas of Quebec}}\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n[[Category:National parks of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Important Bird Areas of Canada]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Capitale-Nationale]]\n\n{{Quebec-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Veillg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMammals", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grands-Jardins_National_Park"}

The older, lower results, which are even lower than estimated in the general population, were due to the methodology of questioning respondents face-to-face, which led to [[social desirability bias]].<ref name=\"FirstSurvey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.furcenter.org/pubs/SF_2008.pdf|title=State of the Fandom|date=June 27, 2008|work=Furry Research Center|author=Alex Osaki|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223529/http://www.furcenter.org/pubs/SF_2008.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/animal-magnetism-inside-the-world-of-the-furries/|title=Animal magnetism: Inside the world of the furries|author=Griffiths, Mark|date=2012-04-05|accessdate=2012-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728095943/http://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/animal-magnetism-inside-the-world-of-the-furries/|archive-date=2012-07-28|url-status=live}}</ref> In contrast, one comparative study from 1974 and 1980 showed 7.5% of sampled students at University of Northern Iowa reporting zoophilia,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Story | first1 = MD | year = 1982 | title = A comparison of university student experience with various sexual outlets in 1974 and 1980 | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 17 | issue = 68| pages = 737\u201347 | pmid = 7164870 }}</ref> while other studies find only 2.2%<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Joyal | first1 = C.

Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, this is due to the fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self.

One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location which was lost during the flood in [[Noah]]'s time and was finally rebuilt by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] that although several other temples might have preceded the ''Kaaba'', it was the first \"House of God\", dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22:26\u201329.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 3:96|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=7&tSoraNo=3&tAyahNo=96&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1}}</ref> A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari|location=Book 55, Hadith 585|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&translator=1&start=0&number=585#585}}</ref>\n\nWhile Abraham was building the ''Kaaba'', an angel brought to him the [[Black Stone]] which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam-e-Ibrahim (literally the Station of Abraham) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam-e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the [[Hajj]] and the [[Korban]], sacrifice of cattle. The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden.{{cite quran|22|26|e=33}}\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the [[Zamzam Well|oasis of Zam-Zam]] gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the ''Kaaba'' representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes. Several rituals were adopted in the Pilgrimage (Hajj) including doing naked circumambulation.<ref name=\"Ishaq2\">{{Cite book | last = Ibn Ishaq | first = Muhammad | title = Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah \u2013 The Life of Muhammad Translated by A.

There was a \"red stone\", the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and the \"white stone\" in the ''Kaaba'' of al-Abalat (near the city of [[Tabalah, Saudi Arabia|Tabala]], south of Mecca). Grunebaum in ''Classical Islam'' points out that the experience of divinity of that period was often associated with stone [[Fetishism|fetishes]], mountains, special rock formations, or \"trees of strange growth.\"<ref>Grunebaum, p. 24</ref>\n\nThe ''Kaaba'' was thought to be at the center of the world, with the Gate of Heaven directly above it. The ''Kaaba'' marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane; the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as a [[meteorite]] that had fallen from the sky and linked heaven and earth.<ref>Armstrong, ''Jerusalem'', p. 221</ref>\n\nAccording to Sarwar,<ref>{{cite book|title=Muhammad the Holy Prophet|author=Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> about 400 years before the birth of Muhammad, a man named \"Amr bin Lahyo bin Harath bin Amr ul-Qais bin Thalaba bin Azd bin Khalan bin Babalyun bin Saba\", who was descended from [[Qahtan]] and was the king of [[Hijaz]] had placed a Hubal idol onto the roof of the ''Kaaba''. This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. When the idol was moved inside the ''Kaaba'', it had seven arrows in front of it, which were used for [[divination]].<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''Muhammad and the origins of Islam'', SUNY Press, 1994, p. 109.</ref>\n\nTo maintain peace among the perpetually warring tribes, Mecca was declared a sanctuary where no violence was allowed within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the ''Kaaba''. This combat-free zone allowed Mecca to thrive not only as a place of pilgrimage, but also as a trading center.<ref>Armstrong, ''Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths'', pp. 221\u201322</ref>\n\nMany Muslim and academic historians stress the power and importance of the pre-Islamic Mecca. They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the [[spice trade]]. Crone believes that this is an exaggeration and that Mecca may only have been an outpost trading with nomads for leather, cloth, and camel butter. Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as [[Procopius]], [[Nonnosus]], or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac. The town is absent, however, from any geographies or histories written in the three centuries before the rise of Islam.<ref>{{cite book| last = Crone| first = Patricia| authorlink = | title = Makkan Trade and the Rise of Islam| publisher = Gorgias |year=2004| location = Piscataway, New Jersey| url =| doi = | id = }} p. 137</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', \"before the rise of Islam it was revered as a sacred sanctuary and was a site of pilgrimage.\"<ref>Britannica 2002 Deluxe Edition [[CD-ROM]], \"Ka'bah.\"</ref> According to [[Germany|German]] historian Eduard Glaser, the name \"''Kaaba''\" may have been related to the southern [[Arabian]] or [[Ethiopia]]n word \"''mikrab''\", signifying a temple.<ref name=\"eoi318\"/> Again, Crone disputes this etymology.\n\nIn [[Samaritan]] literature, the Samaritan Book of the Secrets of Moses (Asatir) claims that Ishmael and his eldest son [[Nebaioth]] built the ''Kaaba'' as well as the city of Mecca.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gaster |first= Moses |title= The Asatir: the Samaritan book of Moses |url= https://archive.org/stream/MN40245ucmf_0#page/n271/mode/2up |quote= Ishmaelites built Mecca (Baka, Bakh) |year= 1927 |publisher=The Royal Asiatic Society |location=London |pages=262, 71 }}</ref> \"The Secrets of Moses\" or Asatir book was suggested by some opinion to have been compiled in the 10th century,<ref>Crown, Alan David (2001).

The iconography in the ''Kaaba'' also included paintings of other prophets and angels. It is possible the paintings of the prophets and angels were figures associated with the Prophet Isa and Maryam. Inside the ''Kaaba'', undefined decorations, money and a pair of ram's horns were recorded to be there. The pair of ram's horns were said to have belonged to the ram sacrificed by the Prophet Ibrahim in place of his son, the Prophet ismaeel.\n\nAl-Azraqi provides the following narrative on the authority of his grandfather, whose own source was Da'ud b.'Abd al-Rahman, who said that Ibn Jurayj had said that Sulayman b.Musa al-Shami asked 'Ata' b. Abi Rabah the following:<ref name=\":2\"/><blockquote>I have heard that there was set up in ''al-Bayt'' (the Ka'ba) a picture (''timthal'') of Maryam and Isa.

Muhammad took part in the reconstruction of the ''Kaaba'' after its structure was damaged due to floods around 600 CE. [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s ''[[Sirat Ras\u016bl All\u0101h]]'', one of the biographies of Muhammad (as reconstructed and translated by Guillaume), describes Muhammad settling a quarrel between Meccan clans as to which clan should set the Black Stone cornerstone in place.\n\nAccording to Ishaq's biography, Muhammad's solution was to have all the clan elders raise the cornerstone on a cloak, after which Muhammad set the stone into its final place with his own hands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillaume |first=A. | title=The Life of Muhammad |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1955 |location=Oxford}} pp. 84\u201387</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s6.html |title=Muhammad's Birth and Forty Years prior to Prophethood|work=Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum (The Sealed Nectar): Memoirs of the Noble Prophet|accessdate=2007-05-04|author=Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, translated by Issam Diab|year=1979}}</ref> Ibn Ishaq says that the timber for the reconstruction of the ''Kaaba'' came from a Greek ship that had been wrecked on the [[Red Sea]] coast at Shu'ayba and that the work was undertaken by a [[Copt]]ic carpenter called Baqum.<ref>Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245.

During the first half of Muhammad's time as a prophet while he was at Mecca, he and his followers were severely persecuted which eventually led to their migration to [[Medina]] in 622 CE.

''Tawaf'' is also performed by pilgrims during the ''\u02bf[[Umrah]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629|links=no}}, Lesser Pilgrimage).<ref name=\"eoi317\"/> However, the most significant time is during the ''hajj'', when millions of pilgrims gather to circle the building during a 5-day period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/7769689.stm|title=In pictures: Hajj pilgrimage|date=7 December 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2006/12/as_hajj_begins_more_changes_and_challenges_in_store/ |title=As Hajj begins, more changes and challenges in store}}</ref> In 2017, the number of pilgrims coming from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform ''hajj'' was officially reported as 1,752,014 and 600,108 Saudi Arabian residents bringing the total number of pilgrims to 2,352,122.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/28|title=Haj Statistics|last=|first=|date=2017|website=General Authority for Statistics, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620024237/https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/28|archive-date=20 June 2018|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> In the 2019 hajj, The Kingdom reported 2,489,406 foreign pilgrims and 634,379 domestic pilgrims (total 3,123,785).<ref>{{cite web |title=Limited to Actual Haj |url=https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/28 |website=General Authority for Statistics |publisher=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Lexicology==\nThe literal meaning of the Arabic word ''ka\u02bfbah'' (\u0643\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629) is 'cube'.<ref>Hans Wehr, Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, 1994.</ref> In the Quran, the Kaaba is also mentioned as ''al-Bayt'' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a|lit=the house|link=no}}) and ''Bayt\u012b'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u0650\u064a|lit=My House|link=no}}) [2:125, 22:26], ''Baytik al-Mu\u1e25arram'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0645|lit=Your Inviolable House|link=no}}) [14:37], ''al-Bayt al-\u1e24ar\u0101m'' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0645|lit=The Sacred House|link=no}}) [5:97], ''al-Bayt al-\u02bfAt\u012bq'' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0642|lit=The Ancient House|link=no}}) [22:29], and.

One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location which was lost during the flood in [[Noah]]'s time and was finally rebuilt by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] that although several other temples might have preceded the ''Kaaba'', it was the first \"House of God\", dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22:26\u201329.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 3:96|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=7&tSoraNo=3&tAyahNo=96&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1}}</ref> A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari|location=Book 55, Hadith 585|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&translator=1&start=0&number=585#585}}</ref>\n\nWhile Abraham was building the ''Kaaba'', an angel brought to him the [[Black Stone]] which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam-e-Ibrahim (literally the Station of Abraham) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam-e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the [[Hajj]] and the [[Korban]], sacrifice of cattle. The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden.{{cite quran|22|26|e=33}}\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the [[Zamzam Well|oasis of Zam-Zam]] gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry.

There was a \"red stone\", the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and the \"white stone\" in the ''Kaaba'' of al-Abalat (near the city of [[Tabalah, Saudi Arabia|Tabala]], south of Mecca).

This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. When the idol was moved inside the ''Kaaba'', it had seven arrows in front of it, which were used for [[divination]].<ref>Francis E.

Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as [[Procopius]], [[Nonnosus]], or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac.
