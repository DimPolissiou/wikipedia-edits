Numerous societies recognize various fields and circumstances. The [[Order of the Arrow]], for example, is the national honor society of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Chiefly, the term refers to '''scholastic honor societies''', those that recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, often within a specific academic discipline.\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on the scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or [[grade point average]]s of those students, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition.  In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are usually required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student.  Some honor societies are invitation only while others allow unsolicited applications.  Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field.\n\n[[Academic regalia in the United States|Academic robes and regalia]] identifying by color the degree, school and other distinction, are controlled under rules of a voluntary Intercollegiate Code.  In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarves]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society.  Of these, cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most often used to indicate membership. Most institutions allow honor cords, tassels and/or medallions for honor society members.  Stoles are less common, but they are available for a few honor societies. Virtually all, if not all honor societies have chosen such colors, and may sell these items of accessory regalia as a service or fundraiser.\n\nMany [[fraternities and sororities]] are referred to by their membership or by non-members as honor societies, and [[vice versa]], though this is not always the case. Honor societies exist at the [[high school]], [[college|collegiate]]/[[university]], and [[postgraduate]] levels, although university honor societies are by far the most prevalent. In America, the oldest academic society, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], was founded as a social and literary fraternity in 1776 at the [[College of William and Mary]] and later organized as an honor society in 1898, following the establishment of the honor societies [[Tau Beta Pi]] for Engineering (1885), [[Sigma Xi]] for Scientific Research (1886), and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] for all disciplines (1897).  [[Mortar Board]] was established in 1918, as the first national honor society for senior women, with chapters at four institutions: [[Cornell University]], [[The University of Michigan]], [[The Ohio State University]] and [[Swarthmore College]].  Later, the society became [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe [[Association of College Honor Societies]] (ACHS) is a predominantly [[United States|American]], voluntary association of national collegiate and post-graduate honor societies. ACHS was formed in 1925 to establish and maintain desirable standards for honor societies. While ACHS membership is a certification that the member societies meet these standards, not all legitimate honor societies apply for membership in ACHS.\n\n== List of scholastic examples ==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2016}}\nNotable national and international honor societies based in or at schools include the following:\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\n==== General scholastic honor societies ====\n<!--Editors: to add color swatches, see the Talk page for instructions.-->\n*[[Alpha Chi National College Honor Society|Alpha Chi]], \u0391\u03a7  (all academic fields), colors: {{color box|#50C878}} [[Shades of green#Emerald|Emerald Green]] and {{color box|#0067A5}} [[Sapphire (color)|Sapphire blue]]\n*[[Alpha Kappa Mu]], \u0391\u039a\u039c (all academic fields)\n*[[Alpha Lambda Delta]], \u0391\u039b\u0394 ([[freshman]] scholarship)\n*[[Alpha Sigma Lambda]], \u0391\u03a3\u039b ([[non-traditional student]]s)\n*[[Alpha Sigma Nu]], \u0391\u03a3\u039d (Scholarship, Loyalty and Service at [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] institutions of higher education), colors: {{color box|#800000}} [[Maroon (color)|Maroon]] and {{color box|#FFD700}} [[Gold (color)|Gold]]\n*[[Delta Epsilon Sigma]], \u0394\u0395\u03a3 (all academic fields at traditionally [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] colleges and universities)\n*[http://www.deths.org/ Delta Epsilon Tau], \u0394\u0395\u03a4 (Distance Education Accrediting Commission institutions)\n*[[Golden Key International Honour Society]] (academics)\n*[[Mortar Board]] (Scholars chosen for Leadership united to Serve)\n*[[National Society of Collegiate Scholars]], NSCS  (scholarship/leadership/service), colors: {{color box|#800020}} [[Burgundy (color)|Burgundy]] and {{color box|#FFD700}} [[Gold (color)|Gold]]\n*[[Phi Eta Sigma]], \u03a6\u0397\u03a3 (freshman scholarship)\n*[[Phi Kappa Phi]], \u03a6\u039a\u03a6 (all academic fields)\n*[[Phi Sigma Pi]], \u03a6\u03a3\u03a0 (all academic fields), colors:  {{color box|#8F00FF}} [[Purple]] and {{color box|#FFD700}}[[Gold (color)|Gold]]\n*[[Phi Tau Phi]], \u03a6\u03a4\u03a6 (all academic fields)\n*[[Tau Sigma]], \u03a4\u03a3 ([[College transfer|transfer students]])\n*[[Lambda Sigma]], \u039b\u03a3 (student leadership, scholarship, and service)\n*[[Order of Omega]] ([[fraternities and sororities]])\n*[[Sigma Alpha Lambda]], \u03a3\u0391\u039b (all academic fields)\n\n====Discipline-specific scholastic honor societies====\n* [[Eta Sigma Delta]] (International Hospitality Management Honor Society, ICHRIE)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrie.org|title=Home -

''Tyee'' ([[yearbook]] of the [[University of Washington]])]]\nIn the [[United States]], an '''honor society''' is a rank organization that recognizes excellence among peers. Numerous societies recognize various fields and circumstances. The [[Order of the Arrow]], for example, is the national honor society of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Chiefly, the term refers to '''scholastic honor societies''', those that recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, often within a specific academic discipline.\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on the scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or [[grade point average]]s of those students, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition.  In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are usually required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student.  Some honor societies are invitation only while others allow unsolicited applications.  Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field.\n\n[[Academic regalia in the United States|Academic robes and regalia]] identifying by color the degree, school and other distinction, are controlled under rules of a voluntary Intercollegiate Code.  In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarves]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society.  Of these, cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most often used to indicate membership. Most institutions allow honor cords, tassels and/or medallions for honor society members.  Stoles are less common, but they are available for a few honor societies. Virtually all, if not all honor societies have chosen such colors, and may sell these items of accessory regalia as a service or fundraiser.\n\nMany [[fraternities and sororities]] are referred to by their membership or by non-members as honor societies, and [[vice versa]], though this is not always the case. Honor societies exist at the [[high school]], [[college|collegiate]]/[[university]], and [[postgraduate]] levels, although university honor societies are by far the most prevalent. In America, the oldest academic society, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], was founded as a social and literary fraternity in 1776 at the [[College of William and Mary]] and later organized as an honor society in 1898, following the establishment of the honor societies [[Tau Beta Pi]] for Engineering (1885), [[Sigma Xi]] for Scientific Research (1886), and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] for all disciplines (1897).  [[Mortar Board]] was established in 1918, as the first national honor society for senior women, with chapters at four institutions: [[Cornell University]], [[The University of Michigan]], [[The Ohio State University]] and [[Swarthmore College]].  Later, the society became [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe [[Association of College Honor Societies]] (ACHS) is a predominantly [[United States|American]], voluntary association of national collegiate and post-graduate honor societies.

{"title_page": "History of Christianity in Romania", "text_new": "{{history of Romania}}\nThe '''history of Christianity in Romania''' began within the [[Roman province]] of [[Lower Moesia]], where many [[Christians]] were martyred at the end of the 3rd century. Evidence of Christian communities has been found in the territory of modern [[Romania]] at over a hundred archaeological sites from the 3rd and 4th centuries. However, sources from the 7th and 10th centuries are so scarce that [[Christianity]] seems to have diminished during this period.\n\nThe vast majority of [[Romanians]] are adherent to the [[Orthodox Church]], while most other populations that speak [[Romance languages]] follow the [[Catholic Church]]. The basic Christian terminology in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is of [[Latin]] origin, though the Romanians, referred to as [[Vlachs]] in medieval sources, borrowed numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] terms due to the adoption of the [[liturgy]] officiated in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The earliest Romanian translations of religious texts appeared in the 15th century, and [[Bucharest Bible of 1688|the first complete translation of the Bible]] was published in 1688.\n\nThe oldest proof that an Orthodox church hierarchy existed among the Romanians north of the river [[Danube]] is a [[papal bull]] of 1234. In the territories east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], two [[metropolitan see]]s subordinate to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] were set up after the foundation of two principalities, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] in the 14th&nbsp;century. The growth of [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] in Moldavia provided a historical link between the 14th-century [[Hesychast]] revival and the modern development of the monastic tradition in [[Eastern Europe]]. Orthodoxy was for centuries only tolerated in the regions west of the Carpathians where [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]]s were established within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 11th&nbsp;century. In these territories, transformed into the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] in the 16th&nbsp;century, four \"received religions\" \u2013 Catholicism, [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Unitarianism]] \u2013 were granted a privileged status. After the principality was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], a part of the local Orthodox clergy declared the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|union with Rome]] in 1698.\n\nThe [[autocephaly]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] was [[canon law|canonically]] recognized in 1885, years after [[United Principalities|the union of Wallachia and Moldavia into Romania]]. The Orthodox Church and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome]] were declared [[national church]]es in 1923. The [[Communist]] authorities abolished the latter, and the former was subordinated to the government in 1948. The [[Uniate]] Church was reestablished when the Communist regime collapsed in 1989. Now the [[Constitution of Romania]] emphasizes churches' autonomy from the state.\n\n== Pre-Christian religions ==\n{{Main|Dacian mythology|Religion in ancient Rome}}\n{{See also|Dacia}}\n[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Map of Dacia and Moesia|[[Roman provinces]] in modern Romania (106\u2013117)]]\nThe religion of the [[Getae]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] people inhabiting the [[Lower Danube]] region in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], was characterized by a belief in the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]].<ref name='Treptow 1997 20'>Treptow ''et al.'' 1997, p. 20.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 98.</ref> Another major feature of this religion was the cult of [[Zalmoxis]]; followers of Zalmoxis communicated with him by [[human sacrifice]].<ref name='Treptow 1997 20'/>\n\nModern [[Dobruja]] \u2013 the territory between the river [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]] \u2013 was annexed to the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]] in 46 AD.<ref>Treptow ''et al.'' 1997, p. 28.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 88.</ref> Cults of [[Greek gods]] remained prevalent in this area, even after the conquest.<ref>MacKendrick 1975, pp. 23, 192.</ref> Modern Banat, [[Oltenia]], and Transylvania were transformed into the Roman province of \"[[Roman Dacia|Dacia Traiana]]\" in 106.<ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 84\u201385, 201.</ref> Due to massive colonization, cults originating in the empire's other provinces entered Dacia.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 85.</ref><ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2005, pp. 173\u2013175.</ref> Around 73% of all [[Epigraphy|epigraphic monuments]] at this time were dedicated to [[Graeco-Roman]] gods.<ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2006, p. 94.</ref>\n\nThe province of \"Dacia Traiana\" was dissolved in the 270s.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'/> Modern Dobruja became a separate province under the name of [[Scythia Minor]] in 297.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'/><ref name='Pacurariu 187'>Pacurariu 2007, p. 187</ref><ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2006, p. 103.</ref>\n\n== Origin of the Romanians' Christianity ==\n{{See also|Origin of the Romanians}}\nThe oldest proof that an Orthodox church hierarchy existed among the Romanians north of the river [[Danube]] is a [[papal bull]] of 1234.

Evidence of Christian communities has been found in the territory of modern [[Romania]] at over a hundred archaeological sites from the 3rd and 4th centuries. However, sources from the 7th and 10th centuries are so scarce that [[Christianity]] seems to have diminished during this period.\n\nThe vast majority of [[Romanians]] are adherent to the [[Orthodox Church]], while most other populations that speak [[Romance languages]] follow the [[Catholic Church]]. The basic Christian terminology in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is of [[Latin]] origin, though the Romanians, referred to as [[Vlachs]] in medieval sources, borrowed numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] terms due to the adoption of the [[liturgy]] officiated in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The earliest Romanian translations of religious texts appeared in the 15th century, and [[Bucharest Bible of 1688|the first complete translation of the Bible]] was published in 1688.\n\nThe oldest proof that an Orthodox church hierarchy existed among the Romanians north of the river [[Danube]] is a [[papal bull]] of 1234. In the territories east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], two [[metropolitan see]]s subordinate to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] were set up after the foundation of two principalities, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] in the 14th&nbsp;century. The growth of [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] in Moldavia provided a historical link between the 14th-century [[Hesychast]] revival and the modern development of the monastic tradition in [[Eastern Europe]]. Orthodoxy was for centuries only tolerated in the regions west of the Carpathians where [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]]s were established within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 11th&nbsp;century. In these territories, transformed into the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] in the 16th&nbsp;century, four \"received religions\" \u2013 Catholicism, [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Unitarianism]] \u2013 were granted a privileged status. After the principality was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], a part of the local Orthodox clergy declared the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|union with Rome]] in 1698.\n\nThe [[autocephaly]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] was [[canon law|canonically]] recognized in 1885, years after [[United Principalities|the union of Wallachia and Moldavia into Romania]]. The Orthodox Church and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome]] were declared [[national church]]es in 1923. The [[Communist]] authorities abolished the latter, and the former was subordinated to the government in 1948. The [[Uniate]] Church was reestablished when the Communist regime collapsed in 1989. Now the [[Constitution of Romania]] emphasizes churches' autonomy from the state.\n\n== Pre-Christian religions ==\n{{Main|Dacian mythology|Religion in ancient Rome}}\n{{See also|Dacia}}\n[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Map of Dacia and Moesia|[[Roman provinces]] in modern Romania (106\u2013117)]]\nThe religion of the [[Getae]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] people inhabiting the [[Lower Danube]] region in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], was characterized by a belief in the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]].<ref name='Treptow 1997 20'>Treptow ''et al.'' 1997, p. 20.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 98.</ref> Another major feature of this religion was the cult of [[Zalmoxis]]; followers of Zalmoxis communicated with him by [[human sacrifice]].<ref name='Treptow 1997 20'/>\n\nModern [[Dobruja]] \u2013 the territory between the river [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]] \u2013 was annexed to the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]] in 46 AD.<ref>Treptow ''et al.'' 1997, p. 28.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 88.</ref> Cults of [[Greek gods]] remained prevalent in this area, even after the conquest.<ref>MacKendrick 1975, pp. 23, 192.</ref> Modern Banat, [[Oltenia]], and Transylvania were transformed into the Roman province of \"[[Roman Dacia|Dacia Traiana]]\" in 106.<ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 84\u201385, 201.</ref> Due to massive colonization, cults originating in the empire's other provinces entered Dacia.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 85.</ref><ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2005, pp. 173\u2013175.</ref> Around 73% of all [[Epigraphy|epigraphic monuments]] at this time were dedicated to [[Graeco-Roman]] gods.<ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2006, p. 94.</ref>\n\nThe province of \"Dacia Traiana\" was dissolved in the 270s.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'/> Modern Dobruja became a separate province under the name of [[Scythia Minor]] in 297.<ref name='Treptow, Popa 85'/><ref name='Pacurariu 187'>Pacurariu 2007, p. 187</ref><ref>Pop ''et al.'' 2006, p. 103.</ref>\n\n== Origin of the Romanians' Christianity ==\n{{See also|Origin of the Romanians}}\nThe oldest proof that an Orthodox church hierarchy existed among the Romanians north of the river [[Danube]] is a [[papal bull]] of 1234.
