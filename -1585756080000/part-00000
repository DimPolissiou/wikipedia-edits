{"title_page": "List of American and Canadian cities by number of major professional sports franchises", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2019}}\nThis is a list of [[metropolitan area]]s in the United States and Canada categorized by the number of major [[professional sports]] franchises in their metropolitan areas.\n\n==Major professional sports leagues==\n{{Main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada}}\n\nThe '''major professional sports leagues''', or simply '''major leagues''', in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of [[team sport]]s in the two countries. Although individual sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[auto racing]] are also very popular, the term is usually limited to team sports.\n\nThe term \"major league\" was first used in 1921 in reference to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the top level of professional American [[baseball]]. Today, the major northern North America professional team sports leagues are [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).<ref name=everson20090507>{{cite news|last=Everson|first=Darren|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124166336985294745|title=The Four Sports Commissioners Weigh In|page=D9|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 7, 2009|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThese four leagues are also commonly referred to as the ''Big Four''. Each of these is the richest professional club competition in its sport worldwide. The best players can become [[cultural icon]]s in both countries and elsewhere in the world, because the leagues enjoy a significant place in [[popular culture]] in the [[Culture of the United States|U.S.]] and [[Canadian popular culture|Canada]]. The NFL has 32 teams, the NHL has 31, and MLB and the NBA each have 30. The most recent market to receive its first \"Big Four\" team is [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], which saw the NHL's [[Vegas Golden Knights]] make their debut for the 2017\u201318 season.\n\nBaseball, football, and hockey have had professional leagues for over 100 years; early leagues such as the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|National Association]], [[Ohio League]], and [[National Hockey Association]] formed the basis of the modern MLB, NFL and NHL respectively.  Basketball is a relatively new development; the NBA evolved from the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] and its splinter group the [[Basketball Association of America]], taking on its current form in 1949.\n\nOther notable leagues include [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), both of which compare to the other four leagues in certain metrics but not in others. Every major league, including the CFL and MLS, draws 15,000 or more fans in attendance per game on average as of 2015. Therefore, this list includes a ranking by teams in the Big Four (B4), and a separate ranking also including teams in the CFL and MLS, called the Big Six (B6).\n\n==Metropolitan area==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nThough teams are listed here by metropolitan area, the distribution and support of teams within an area can reveal regional fractures below that level, whether by neighborhood, rival cities within a [[media market]] or separate markets entirely. [[Baseball]] teams provide illustrations for several of these models. In New York City, the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] are popularly dubbed the \"[[Bronx]] Bombers\" for their home borough and generally command the loyalties of fans from the Bronx, parts of [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]], [[Manhattan]], [[Long Island]], parts of [[North Jersey]] and [[Westchester County, New York]], while the [[New York Mets|Mets]] play in [[Queens]] and draw support from Queens, Brooklyn and parts of Long Island, revealing a split by neighborhood. The [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]] represent rival cities within the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], a single media market. Though the [[Washington Nationals]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] share a metro area, their cities anchor separate media markets and hold distinctly separate cultural identities. In Los Angeles, the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] share an arena ([[Staples Center]]), and media coverage is split amongst different broadcasters in the metro area.\n\nWith the [[Vegas Golden Knights]], based in the [[Las Vegas Valley]], the 23rd largest market in North America, having joined the [[National Hockey League]] in 2017, the largest urban areas without a team in one of the big four leagues are the 32nd-ranked [[Greater Austin|Austin region]] and the 37th-ranked [[Hampton Roads|Virginia Beach-Norfolk region]]. The smallest metropolitan area to have a Big Four team is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] ([[Green Bay Packers]]), which is the 146th largest metropolitan area, though much of its fan base is drawn from [[Milwaukee]], which is 120 miles away and the 38th largest market. The smallest stand-alone metropolitan area to have a Big Four team is the 78th-largest market, [[Winnipeg]] ([[Winnipeg Jets]]), while the 54th-largest market, [[New Orleans \u2013 Metairie \u2013 Bogalusa combined statistical area|New Orleans]], is the smallest metropolitan area to have more than one Big Four team ([[New Orleans Pelicans]] and [[New Orleans Saints]]).\n\n[[Foxboro, Massachusetts]], population 16,685 as of the 2010 Census, is a small town which hosts two major-league teams (the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[New England Revolution]]). Foxboro is considered part of the [[Greater Boston|Boston metropolitan area]], even though it is slightly closer to [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. In a comparable situation, the even smaller town of [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], population 8,913, hosts the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]]; the same city previously hosted the now-[[Brooklyn Nets]], [[New Jersey Devils]] and now-[[New York Red Bulls]]. East Rutherford, although in a different state, is part of the [[New York City metropolitan area]].\n\n==Teams by metropolitan area==\nThe following list contains all metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada containing at least one team in any of the six major leagues.

Although individual sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[auto racing]] are also very popular, the term is usually limited to team sports.\n\nThe term \"major league\" was first used in 1921 in reference to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the top level of professional American [[baseball]]. Today, the major northern North America professional team sports leagues are [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).<ref name=everson20090507>{{cite news|last=Everson|first=Darren|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124166336985294745|title=The Four Sports Commissioners Weigh In|page=D9|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 7, 2009|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThese four leagues are also commonly referred to as the ''Big Four''. Each of these is the richest professional club competition in its sport worldwide. The best players can become [[cultural icon]]s in both countries and elsewhere in the world, because the leagues enjoy a significant place in [[popular culture]] in the [[Culture of the United States|U.S.]] and [[Canadian popular culture|Canada]]. The NFL has 32 teams, the NHL has 31, and MLB and the NBA each have 30. The most recent market to receive its first \"Big Four\" team is [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], which saw the NHL's [[Vegas Golden Knights]] make their debut for the 2017\u201318 season.\n\nBaseball, football, and hockey have had professional leagues for over 100 years; early leagues such as the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|National Association]], [[Ohio League]], and [[National Hockey Association]] formed the basis of the modern MLB, NFL and NHL respectively.  Basketball is a relatively new development; the NBA evolved from the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] and its splinter group the [[Basketball Association of America]], taking on its current form in 1949.\n\nOther notable leagues include [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), both of which compare to the other four leagues in certain metrics but not in others. Every major league, including the CFL and MLS, draws 15,000 or more fans in attendance per game on average as of 2015. Therefore, this list includes a ranking by teams in the Big Four (B4), and a separate ranking also including teams in the CFL and MLS, called the Big Six (B6).\n\n==Metropolitan area==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nThough teams are listed here by metropolitan area, the distribution and support of teams within an area can reveal regional fractures below that level, whether by neighborhood, rival cities within a [[media market]] or separate markets entirely. [[Baseball]] teams provide illustrations for several of these models. In New York City, the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] are popularly dubbed the \"[[Bronx]] Bombers\" for their home borough and generally command the loyalties of fans from the Bronx, parts of [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]], [[Manhattan]], [[Long Island]], parts of [[North Jersey]] and [[Westchester County, New York]], while the [[New York Mets|Mets]] play in [[Queens]] and draw support from Queens, Brooklyn and parts of Long Island, revealing a split by neighborhood. The [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]] represent rival cities within the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], a single media market. Though the [[Washington Nationals]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] share a metro area, their cities anchor separate media markets and hold distinctly separate cultural identities. In Los Angeles, the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] share an arena ([[Staples Center]]), and media coverage is split amongst different broadcasters in the metro area.\n\nWith the [[Vegas Golden Knights]], based in the [[Las Vegas Valley]], the 23rd largest market in North America, having joined the [[National Hockey League]] in 2017, the largest urban areas without a team in one of the big four leagues are the 32nd-ranked [[Greater Austin|Austin region]] and the 37th-ranked [[Hampton Roads|Virginia Beach-Norfolk region]]. The smallest metropolitan area to have a Big Four team is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] ([[Green Bay Packers]]), which is the 146th largest metropolitan area, though much of its fan base is drawn from [[Milwaukee]], which is 120 miles away and the 38th largest market. The smallest stand-alone metropolitan area to have a Big Four team is the 78th-largest market, [[Winnipeg]] ([[Winnipeg Jets]]), while the 54th-largest market, [[New Orleans \u2013 Metairie \u2013 Bogalusa combined statistical area|New Orleans]], is the smallest metropolitan area to have more than one Big Four team ([[New Orleans Pelicans]] and [[New Orleans Saints]]).\n\n[[Foxboro, Massachusetts]], population 16,685 as of the 2010 Census, is a small town which hosts two major-league teams (the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[New England Revolution]]). Foxboro is considered part of the [[Greater Boston|Boston metropolitan area]], even though it is slightly closer to [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. In a comparable situation, the even smaller town of [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], population 8,913, hosts the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]]; the same city previously hosted the now-[[Brooklyn Nets]], [[New Jersey Devils]] and now-[[New York Red Bulls]]. East Rutherford, although in a different state, is part of the [[New York City metropolitan area]].\n\n==Teams by metropolitan area==\nThe following list contains all metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada containing at least one team in any of the six major leagues.

PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.\n\nPTFE is used as a [[non-stick coating]] for pans and other cookware. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Happy Pan Poster.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the Happy Pan, a Teflon-coated pan from the 1960s]]\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/teflon \"From stove tops to outer space...

Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes it the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker and lower-melting-point [[polyethylene]] commonly used in low-cost applications.\n\nIn industrial applications, owing to its low friction, PTFE is used for [[plain bearing]]s, [[gear]]s, [[slide plate]]s, seals, gaskets, bushings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espemfg.com/teflon-machining-fabrication.html|title=Teflon Machining & Fabrication {{!}} ESPE|website=www.espemfg.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]] and [[nylon]].<ref>Mishra & Yagci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC&pg=PA573 p 573]</ref>\n \nIts extremely high bulk [[resistivity]] makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life [[electret]]s, the [[electrostatic]] analogues of [[magnet|permanent magnets]].\n\nPTFE film is also widely used in the production of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the [[Hubert H.

It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.

PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores.

It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.\n\n[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]\n\nThe sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).<ref>[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers \u00e0 repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

However, there has been relatively little conversation about the presence of these chemicals in our everyday lives and the public\u2019s sheer exposure to PFAS through primary contact from commercial products used in our everyday lives. Several peer reviewed studies have shown that the mean and median concentration of PFOA in household dust in the US was found to be between approximately 10,000 and 50,000 parts per trillion (ppt)3. These studies highlight the fact that there is significantly more PFOA in the ambient dust in the average home than the levels currently being discussed as thresholds for drinking water. Because PFAS is in the products we use, is transported through air and water and has been found in the food we eat, there are numerous public exposure pathways for PFAS beyond drinking water. <ref>{{http://www.mwra.com/01news/2019/2019-11-PFAS-fact-sheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Ecotoxicity == \n[[Sodium trifluoroacetate]] and the similar compound chlorodifluoroacetate can both be generated when PTFE undergoes thermolysis, as well as producing longer chain polyfluoro- and/or polychlorofluoro- (C3-C14) carboxylic acids which may be equally persistent.

The title was originally published in [[Nigeria]] in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \"Powerman\" to \"Powerbolt\" to avoid confusion with the character [[Luke Cage]] (also called \"Power Man\"), published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was ''Aces'', a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized [[Jazz Age]] genre stories which were originally published in Europe.
