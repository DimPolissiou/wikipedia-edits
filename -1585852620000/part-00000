The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.

The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.

It is a [[communes of France|commune]] located in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[departments of France|department]], and host city of the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Midem]], and [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]]. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|2011 G20 summit]].\n\n==History==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the [[Liguria]]n [[Oxybii]] established a settlement here known as ''Aegitna'' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1}}).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Aegitna|title=Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|volume=I|year=1893|lang=de|page=477}}</ref> Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]].\n[[File:Cannes SPOT 1160.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cannes seen from Spot Satellite]]\nIn 69 [[AD]], it became the scene of violent conflict between the troops of [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]].<ref>Reported in [[Polybius]], Histories, 33.10.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, the town was known as Canua.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meeks |first1=Jacqueline Monsigny, Edward |title=Le roman du festival de Cannes |date=2007 |publisher=Rocher |location=Monaco |isbn=978-2268061931 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruZkAAAAMAAJ |language=fr}}</ref> The name may derive from \"canna\", a [[Reed (plant)|reed]]. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\n\nAn attack by the [[Saracen]]s in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\n\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\n\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the [[Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus]]. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the [[Crimean War]].\n\n[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of [[Trams in Cannes|streetcars]]. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\n\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton]], [[Hotel Majestic Barri\u00e8re|Majestic]], [[Grand Hyatt Cannes H\u00f4tel Martinez|Martinez]], and [[JW Marriott Cannes]] were built. The city was modernised with a [[Stade Pierre de Coubertin (Cannes)|sports centre]], a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the [[World War I|First World War]], but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\n\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before [[World War II]]. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n==Climate==\nCannes has a [[subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild.

They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near [[Florence]], which may be visited on appointment.\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n[[File:Cannes hombre de la mascara de hierro.jpg|alt=Last refuge of the man in the iron mask in Cannes, France|thumb|Last refuge of the [[Man in the Iron Mask|man in the iron mask]] in Cannes, France]]\nIt took the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] 11 years to leave the tiny, forested [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite|St Marguerite Island]]. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern [[\u00cele Saint-Honorat|St Honorat Island]].

It is a [[communes of France|commune]] located in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[departments of France|department]], and host city of the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Midem]], and [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]]. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|2011 G20 summit]].\n\n==History==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the [[Liguria]]n [[Oxybii]] established a settlement here known as ''Aegitna'' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1}}).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Aegitna|title=Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|volume=I|year=1893|lang=de|page=477}}</ref> Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]].\n[[File:Cannes SPOT 1160.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cannes seen from Spot Satellite]]\nIn 69 [[AD]], it became the scene of violent conflict between the troops of [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]].<ref>Reported in [[Polybius]], Histories, 33.10.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, the town was known as Canua.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meeks |first1=Jacqueline Monsigny, Edward |title=Le roman du festival de Cannes |date=2007 |publisher=Rocher |location=Monaco |isbn=978-2268061931 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruZkAAAAMAAJ |language=fr}}</ref> The name may derive from \"canna\", a [[Reed (plant)|reed]]. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\n\nAn attack by the [[Saracen]]s in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\n\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\n\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the [[Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus]]. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the [[Crimean War]].\n\n[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of [[Trams in Cannes|streetcars]]. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\n\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton]], [[Hotel Majestic Barri\u00e8re|Majestic]], [[Grand Hyatt Cannes H\u00f4tel Martinez|Martinez]], and [[JW Marriott Cannes]] were built. The city was modernised with a [[Stade Pierre de Coubertin (Cannes)|sports centre]], a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the [[World War I|First World War]], but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\n\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before [[World War II]]. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n==Climate==\nCannes has a [[subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when {{convert|110|mm|1|abbr=on}} falls.\n\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while average temperatures are about {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\n\nMean temperatures drop below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cannes (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.9\n|Feb record high C = 26.0\n|Mar record high C = 24.8\n|Apr record high C = 27.6\n|May record high C = 31.6\n|Jun record high C = 34.7\n|Jul record high C = 38.0\n|Aug record high C = 37.0\n|Sep record high C = 35.0\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.7\n|Dec record high C = 23.4\n|year record high C = 38.0\n|Jan high C = 13.1\n|Feb high C = 13.5\n|Mar high C = 15.7\n|Apr high C = 17.3\n|May high C = 21.0\n|Jun high C = 24.5\n|Jul high C = 27.5\n|Aug high C = 27.8\n|Sep high C = 24.8\n|Oct high C = 20.9\n|Nov high C = 16.7\n|Dec high C = 13.9\n|year high C = 19.7\n|Jan mean C = 8.4\n|Feb mean C = 8.7\n|Mar mean C = 10.8\n|Apr mean C = 13.0\n|May mean C = 16.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.5\n|Jul mean C = 23.2\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 20.2\n|Oct mean C = 16.6\n|Nov mean C = 12.3\n|Dec mean C = 9.2\n|year mean C = 15.3\n|Jan low C = 3.6\n|Feb low C = 3.9\n|Mar low C = 6.2\n|Apr low C = 8.7\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 16.4\n|Jul low C = 18.8\n|Aug low C = 18.8\n|Sep low C = 15.5\n|Oct low C = 12.3\n|Nov low C = 7.8\n|Dec low C = 4.6\n|year low C = 10.8\n|Jan record low C = \u221212.0\n|Feb record low C = \u22128.6\n|Mar record low C = \u22129.9\n|Apr record low C = \u22120.5\n|May record low C = 2.3\n|Jun record low C = 7.4\n|Jul record low C = 8.8\n|Aug record low C = 10.5\n|Sep record low C = 5.3\n|Oct record low C = 0.9\n|Nov record low C = \u22123.0\n|Dec record low C = \u22125.6\n|year record low C = \u221212.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 76.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 72.5\n|May precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 30.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 16.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 24.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 79.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 120.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 107.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 95.6\n|year precipitation mm = 756\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.80\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.80\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.97\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.53\n|May precipitation days = 5.17\n|Jun precipitation days = 3.73\n|Jul precipitation days = 1.83\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.77\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.43\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.03\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.20\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.50\n|year precipitation days = 60.8\n|Jan humidity = 72\n|Feb humidity = 70\n|Mar humidity = 70\n|Apr humidity = 70\n|May humidity = 73\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 72\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 75\n|Nov humidity = 74\n|Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 72.3\n|Jan sun = 152.3\n|Feb sun = 175.3\n|Mar sun = 225.4\n|Apr sun = 225.3\n|May sun = 265.3\n|Jun sun = 311.5\n|Jul sun = 343.2\n|Aug sun = 316.0\n|Sep sun = 254.6\n|Oct sun = 193.5\n|Nov sun = 148.3\n|Dec sun = 133.8\n|year sun = 2750\n|source 1 = Meteo climat<ref name=MC1>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-r25.php\n| title = Moyennes 1981/2010: R\u00e9gion Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat\n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=MC2>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=65\n| title = STATION Cannes\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat \n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Infoclimat.fr (humidity 1961\u20131990)<ref name=Infoclimat>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie-07684-cannes-mandelieu.html\n| title = Normes et records 1961-1990: Cannes - Mandelieu (06) - altitude 2m \n| language = French\n| publisher = Infoclimat\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.eldoradocountyweather.com/climate/world-extremes/world-temp-rainfall-extremes.php?extremes=Eur</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n[[File:Cannes_Vieux_Port_01.jpg|thumb|250px|Panorama of the waterfront]]\n[[File:Cannes promenade.jpg|thumb|250px|Boulevard de la Croisette along the waterfront.]]\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Aero cannes.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Cannes Mandelieu aero centre]]\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a [[High tech|high-tech]] cluster. The technopolis of [[Sophia Antipolis]] lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cannes-destination.com/index/flagship-envents-in-cannes|title=Major events in Cannes (French Riviera) - Program & Information|website=www.cannes-destination.com|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\n\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation. Cannes has {{formatnum:6500}} companies, of which {{formatnum:3000}} are traders, artisans and service providers. In 2006, 421 new companies were registered.\n\nCannes hosts the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], headquarters of [[Thales Alenia Space]], the first European [[satellite]] manufacturer.\n\n==Sport==\nCannes is home to football side [[AS Cannes]].\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe [[Promenade de la Croisette]] is the waterfront avenue with [[palm trees]]. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and boutiques. [[Le Suquet]], the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Castre]]. A distinctive building in Cannes is the [[St. Michael the Archangel Church (Cannes)|Russian Orthodox church]].\n\n===Museums===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n===Villas===\n[[File:\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille.jpg|alt=\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille|thumb|\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille]]\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near [[Florence]], which may be visited on appointment.\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n[[File:Cannes hombre de la mascara de hierro.jpg|alt=Last refuge of the man in the iron mask in Cannes, France|thumb|Last refuge of the [[Man in the Iron Mask|man in the iron mask]] in Cannes, France]]\nIt took the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] 11 years to leave the tiny, forested [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite|St Marguerite Island]]. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern [[\u00cele Saint-Honorat|St Honorat Island]]. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, [[Mougins]], and [[Vallauris]]. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]] and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n===Theatre and music===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre.

Each lobule is made up of millions of hepatic cells (hepatocytes), which are the basic metabolic cells.

In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

This can lead to scarring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cirrhosis]]. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in [[portal hypertension]]. [[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the [[Haemoglobin|hemoglobin]] of dead [[red blood cell]]s; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and [[cavernous liver haemangioma|hepatic hemangioma]] a [[benign tumour]] the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes [[Coagulation|clotting factors]], substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.<ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121034708/http://ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver |date=2010-11-21 }} Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Most transplants are done for chronic liver diseases leading to [[cirrhosis]], such as chronic [[hepatitis C]], [[alcoholism]], and autoimmune hepatitis. Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for [[fulminant hepatic failure]], in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver [[allograft]]s for [[organ transplantation|transplant]] usually come from donors who have died from fatal [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. [[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.  Due to the ability of the liver to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well.

In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

This can lead to scarring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cirrhosis]]. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in [[portal hypertension]]. [[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the [[Haemoglobin|hemoglobin]] of dead [[red blood cell]]s; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and [[cavernous liver haemangioma|hepatic hemangioma]] a [[benign tumour]] the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes [[Coagulation|clotting factors]], substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.<ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121034708/http://ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver |date=2010-11-21 }} Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Most transplants are done for chronic liver diseases leading to [[cirrhosis]], such as chronic [[hepatitis C]], [[alcoholism]], and autoimmune hepatitis. Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for [[fulminant hepatic failure]], in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver [[allograft]]s for [[organ transplantation|transplant]] usually come from donors who have died from fatal [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. [[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.  Due to the ability of the liver to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well. This procedure is more controversial, as it entails performing a much larger operation on the donor, and indeed there were at least two donor deaths out of the first several hundred cases.

It was used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England, as well as the ''beignets de foie de raie'' and ''foie de raie en croute'' in [[French cuisine]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author= Schwabe, Calvin W.\n|title= Unmentionable Cuisine\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SiBntk9jGmoC&pg=PA313\n|date= 1979\n|publisher= University of Virginia Press\n|isbn= 978-0-8139-1162-5\n|pages= 313\u2013\n|access-date= 2015-06-27\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151026160044/https://books.google.com/books?id=SiBntk9jGmoC&pg=PA313\n|archive-date= 2015-10-26\n|url-status= live\n}}</ref>\n\n===Possible psychoactivity of giraffe liver===\n[[File:ESCAYRAC(1853) p454 Planche VIII.jpg|thumb|19th century drinking scene in [[Kordofan]], home to the [[Humur|Humr]] tribe, imbibers of a drink prepared from [[giraffe]] liver. Plate from ''Le D\u00e9sert et le Soudan'' by [[Stanislas d'Escayrac de Lauture]] ]]\nThe [[Humur|Humr]], one of the tribes in the [[Baggara]] ethnic grouping, native to southwestern [[Kordofan]] in [[Sudan]] and speakers of [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] or [[Chadian Arabic]], prepare a ( non-alcoholic ) drink from the liver and [[bone marrow]] of the [[giraffe]] which they call ''umm nyolokh'', and which they claim is intoxicating  ( Arabic  \u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646  ''sakran'' ), causing dreams and even waking [[hallucination]]s.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\">Rudgley, Richard ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances'' , pub. Abacus 1998 {{ISBN|0 349 11127 8}} pps. 20-21.</ref> Anthropologist [[Ian Cunnison]], who accompanied the Humr on one of their giraffe-hunting expeditions in the late 1950s, notes that:\n\n<blockquote>It is said that a person, once he has drunk ''umm nyolokh'', will return to giraffe again and again. Humr, being [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdists]], are strict [[Khamr|abstainers]] [ from alcohol ] and a Humrawi is never drunk ( ''sakran'' ) on [[liquor]] or beer. But he uses this word to describe the effects which ''umm nyolokh'' has upon him.<ref name = \"Cunnison Giraffe\">Cunnison, Ian 1958 ''Giraffe Hunting among the Humr Tribe'', SNR 39, pps. 49-60.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCunnison's remarkable account of an apparently psychoactive mammal found its way from a somewhat obscure scientific paper into more mainstream literature through a conversation between [[Wendy James (anthropologist)|Dr. Wendy James]] of the Institute of Social and Cultural [[Social anthropology|Anthropology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and specialist on the use of [[hallucinogen]]s and intoxicants in society [[Richard Rudgley]], who considered its implications in his popular work ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances''. Rudgley hypothesises that the presence of the hallucinogenic compound [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] might account for the putative intoxicating properties of ''umm nyolokh''.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\"/>\n\nCunnison himself, on the other hand, had found it hard fully to believe in the literal truth of the Humr's assertion that their drink was intoxicating:\n\n<blockquote>I can only assume that there is no intoxicating substance in the drink and that the effect it produces is simply a matter of convention, although it may be brought about [[placebo|subconsciously]].<ref name = \"Cunnison Giraffe\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe study of [[entheogen]]s in general - including entheogens of animal origin ( e.g. [[hallucinogenic fish]] and [[Colorado River toad|toad venom]] ) - has, however, made considerable progress in the sixty-odd years since Cunnison's report and the idea that some intoxicating principle might reside in giraffe liver no longer seems as far-fetched as it was in Cunnison's day, although conclusive proof ( or disproof ) will have to await detailed analyses of the animal organ  in question and the drink prepared therefrom.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\"/>\n\n===Arrow/bullet poison===\n[[File:Shirokogoroff s m 1929.jpg|thumb|[[S.

Russian anthropologist [[S. M.

For instance, among the Kumar\u010den, [ a subgroup of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] ] even in recent times a poison was used which was prepared from decaying liver. * ( Note ) This has been confirmed by the Kumar\u010den. I am not competent to judge as to the chemical conditions of production of poison which is not destroyed by the heat of explosion. However, the Tungus themselves compare this method [ of poisoning ammunition ] with the poisoning of arrows.<ref>[[S. M.
