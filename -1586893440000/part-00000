It is a shortened version of the term ''[[letters patent]]'', which was an open document or instrument issued by a monarch or government granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system.  Similar grants included [[land patent]]s, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and [[printing patent]]s, a precursor of modern copyright.\n\nIn modern usage, the term ''patent'' usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents something new, useful and non-obvious.

It does not, directly or indirectly, imply any such right. It grants only the right to exclude others. The supposition that a right to make is created by the patent grant is obviously inconsistent with the established distinctions between generic and specific patents, and with the well-known fact that a very considerable portion of the patents granted are in a field covered by a former relatively generic or basic patent, are tributary to such earlier patent, and cannot be practiced unless by license thereunder.\" \u2013 ''Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co.'', 191 F. 579, 584\u201385, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911)</ref> Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the [[Natural and legal rights|right]] to ''exclude others''<ref name=\"Herman\"/> from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented [[invention]] for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]], which is usually 20 years from the filing date<ref name=PatentLength>Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]).</ref> subject to the payment of [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fees]]. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor \"a right to ''try'' to exclude by asserting the patent in court\", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.<ref name=\"lemley-2005\"/> A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, [[mortgage law|mortgaged]], assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.\n\nA patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.<ref name=\"Herman\"/> If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.\n\nSome countries have \"working provisions\" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.\n\n===Challenges===\n{{anchor|Invalid patent}}\nIn most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called [[Opposition proceeding|opposition proceedings]].  It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not [[patentable subject matter]] at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to the [[person skilled in the art]], at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.  Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Roger Allan|title=Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=71\u2013128|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073705/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Arnold B.|title=Evaluating the Validity of a United States Patent|journal=JOM|date=1990|volume=42|issue=7|page=46|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|doi=10.1007/bf03221022|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823135108/http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|archivedate=2016-08-23|bibcode=1990JOM....42g..46S}}</ref>\n\n===Infringement===\n{{Main article|Patent infringement}}\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the U.S.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallor|first1=Jane|title=BUSINESS LAW: THE ETHICAL, GLOBAL, AND E-COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352498-6|pages=266|edition=15th}}</ref>\n\n===Enforcement===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuits]] (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as [[France]] and [[Austria]]) have criminal penalties for [[wikt:wanton#Adjective|wanton]] infringement.<ref>{{cite web |author=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary |year=2005 |title=Patent Litigation across Europe |url=http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203134/http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-06 |publisher=cecollect.com |authorlink=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary }}</ref> Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an [[injunction]] that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the ''[[doctrine of equivalents]]'').\n\nAn accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a [[counterclaim]].  A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.  Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for [[patentability]] in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a [[Novelty (patent)|prior publication]], for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.  An example is the UK [[Certificate of contested validity]].\n\nPatent [[license|licensing agreements]] are [[contract]]s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.  It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under [[cross-licensing]] agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.\n\n===Ownership===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] to a corporate entity subsequently<ref>{{cite web | title=Assignee (Company) Name | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | work=Help Page | publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | accessdate=2007-07-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113345/http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | archivedate=2007-08-14 }}</ref> and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.<ref>See [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf Section 39 of the UK Patents Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004529/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }} as an example.

If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).\n\nThe ability to assign ownership rights increases the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] of a patent as property.

In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes [[prior art]] and enters the [[public domain]] (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally<!--There might be grace periods in some countries (?)--> becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.\n\nCommonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a [[patent office]] with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. \n\nThe authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.<ref>United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the [[Supremacy of Parliament]].</ref>  In the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to make laws to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts...\" The laws Congress passed are codified in [[Title 35 of the United States Code]] and created the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nThere is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) being particularly active in this area.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.  Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.  This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.\n\nInternationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) [constituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|ARIPO]] and [[Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle|OAPI]], the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states that have formed the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. A key international convention relating to patents is the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim [[priority right|priority]]: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.\n\n===Application and prosecution===\n{{Main article|Patent application|Patent prosecution}}\nA patent is requested by filing a written [[Patent application|application]] at the relevant patent office.  The person or company filing the application is referred to as \"the applicant\". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide [[sufficiency of disclosure|sufficient detail]] for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the [[Sufficiency of disclosure|best mode]] of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.\n\nThe application also includes one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define what a patent covers or the \"scope of protection\".\n\nAfter filing, an application is often referred to as \"[[patent pending]]\".  While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|title=What does 'patent pending' mean?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829120240/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011}}</ref><ref>USPTO web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm ''Patent Marking and \"Patent Pending\"'' (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802035958/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}, Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref><ref>[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] web site, [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm ''Display your rights''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903125501/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm |date=2009-09-03 }}, (under \"IPO Home> Types of IP> Patents> Managing your patents> Using and enforcing\") Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref>\n\nOnce filed, a patent application is [[Patent prosecution|\"prosecuted\"]]. A [[patent examiner]] reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the [[patentability]] requirements of that country.  If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their [[patent attorney|patent agent or attorney]] through an [[Office action]], to which the applicant may respond.  The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.  In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an [[opposition proceeding]] between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.\n\nOnce granted the patent is subject in most countries to [[maintenance fee (patent)|renewal fees]] to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.  Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the [[European Patent Office]]) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.\n\n====Costs====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.\n\nThe European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.<ref>With the following assumptions: \"18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee\" (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf ''The cost of a sample European patent \u2013 new estimates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201548/http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}, 2005, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Since the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.\n\nIn the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent ([[patent prosecution]]) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.<ref name=\"lemley\">Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001).

Without product patents with which to contend, Indian pharmaceutical companies were able to churn out countless generic drugs, establishing India as one of the leading generic drug manufacturers in the world. Yet in 2005, because of its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), India was compelled to amend its laws to provide product patent protection to pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to satisfy the competing demands for inexpensive drugs and effective intellectual property protection, the Indian government created a law that afforded protection to pharmaceuticals only if they constituted brand new chemical substances or enhanced the therapeutic \u201cefficacy\u201d of known substances. This law, which is codified under section 3(d) of the Patents ([[Amendment]]) Act of 2005,7 has not sat well with some MNCs, including the Swiss company [[Novartis]]. Following the denial of a patent for its leukemia drug, Glivec, Novartis challenged the validity of section 3(d) under TRIPS and the Indian Constitution.

The 1836 law instituted a significantly more rigorous application process, including the establishment of an examination system. Between 1790 and 1836 about ten thousand patents were granted. By the [[American Civil War]] about 80,000 patents had been granted.<ref>Joseph M. Gabriel, Medical Monopoly: Intellectual Property Rights and the Origins of the Modern Pharmaceutical Industry. University of Chicago Press (2014) </ref>\n\n==Law==\n{{Intellectual property}}\n\n===Effects===\nA patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.<ref name=\"Herman\">\"A patent is not the grant of a right to make or use or sell. It does not, directly or indirectly, imply any such right. It grants only the right to exclude others. The supposition that a right to make is created by the patent grant is obviously inconsistent with the established distinctions between generic and specific patents, and with the well-known fact that a very considerable portion of the patents granted are in a field covered by a former relatively generic or basic patent, are tributary to such earlier patent, and cannot be practiced unless by license thereunder.\" \u2013 ''Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co.'', 191 F. 579, 584\u201385, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911)</ref> Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the [[Natural and legal rights|right]] to ''exclude others''<ref name=\"Herman\"/> from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented [[invention]] for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]], which is usually 20 years from the filing date<ref name=PatentLength>Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]).</ref> subject to the payment of [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fees]]. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor \"a right to ''try'' to exclude by asserting the patent in court\", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.<ref name=\"lemley-2005\"/> A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, [[mortgage law|mortgaged]], assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.\n\nA patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.<ref name=\"Herman\"/> If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.\n\nSome countries have \"working provisions\" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.\n\n===Challenges===\n{{anchor|Invalid patent}}\nIn most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called [[Opposition proceeding|opposition proceedings]].  It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not [[patentable subject matter]] at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to the [[person skilled in the art]], at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.  Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Roger Allan|title=Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=71\u2013128|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073705/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Arnold B.|title=Evaluating the Validity of a United States Patent|journal=JOM|date=1990|volume=42|issue=7|page=46|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|doi=10.1007/bf03221022|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823135108/http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|archivedate=2016-08-23|bibcode=1990JOM....42g..46S}}</ref>\n\n===Infringement===\n{{Main article|Patent infringement}}\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the U.S.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallor|first1=Jane|title=BUSINESS LAW: THE ETHICAL, GLOBAL, AND E-COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352498-6|pages=266|edition=15th}}</ref>\n\n===Enforcement===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuits]] (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as [[France]] and [[Austria]]) have criminal penalties for [[wikt:wanton#Adjective|wanton]] infringement.<ref>{{cite web |author=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary |year=2005 |title=Patent Litigation across Europe |url=http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203134/http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-06 |publisher=cecollect.com |authorlink=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary }}</ref> Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an [[injunction]] that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the ''[[doctrine of equivalents]]'').\n\nAn accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a [[counterclaim]].  A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.  Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for [[patentability]] in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a [[Novelty (patent)|prior publication]], for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.  An example is the UK [[Certificate of contested validity]].\n\nPatent [[license|licensing agreements]] are [[contract]]s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.  It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under [[cross-licensing]] agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.\n\n===Ownership===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] to a corporate entity subsequently<ref>{{cite web | title=Assignee (Company) Name | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | work=Help Page | publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | accessdate=2007-07-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113345/http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | archivedate=2007-08-14 }}</ref> and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.<ref>See [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf Section 39 of the UK Patents Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004529/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }} as an example. The laws across Europe vary from country to country but are generally harmonised.

[[D\u00fcbendorf]] Museum of Military Aviation.]]\n\nThe inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).\n\nThe ability to assign ownership rights increases the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] of a patent as property.  Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm Article 28.2 TRIPs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622154724/https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm |date=2017-06-22 }}: \"''Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts.''\".</ref>  The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.\n\n===Governing laws===\n{{See also|Outline of patents}}\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.  Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.<ref>Staff, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#patent FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225083135/http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html |date=2013-02-25 }}</ref> A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes [[prior art]] and enters the [[public domain]] (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally<!--There might be grace periods in some countries (?)--> becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.\n\nCommonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a [[patent office]] with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. \n\nThe authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.<ref>United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the [[Supremacy of Parliament]].</ref>  In the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to make laws to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts...\" The laws Congress passed are codified in [[Title 35 of the United States Code]] and created the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nThere is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) being particularly active in this area.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.  Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.  This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.\n\nInternationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) [constituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|ARIPO]] and [[Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle|OAPI]], the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states that have formed the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. A key international convention relating to patents is the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim [[priority right|priority]]: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.\n\n===Application and prosecution===\n{{Main article|Patent application|Patent prosecution}}\nA patent is requested by filing a written [[Patent application|application]] at the relevant patent office.  The person or company filing the application is referred to as \"the applicant\". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide [[sufficiency of disclosure|sufficient detail]] for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the [[Sufficiency of disclosure|best mode]] of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.\n\nThe application also includes one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define what a patent covers or the \"scope of protection\".\n\nAfter filing, an application is often referred to as \"[[patent pending]]\".  While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|title=What does 'patent pending' mean?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829120240/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011}}</ref><ref>USPTO web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm ''Patent Marking and \"Patent Pending\"'' (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802035958/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}, Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref><ref>[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] web site, [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm ''Display your rights''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903125501/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm |date=2009-09-03 }}, (under \"IPO Home> Types of IP> Patents> Managing your patents> Using and enforcing\") Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref>\n\nOnce filed, a patent application is [[Patent prosecution|\"prosecuted\"]]. A [[patent examiner]] reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the [[patentability]] requirements of that country.  If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their [[patent attorney|patent agent or attorney]] through an [[Office action]], to which the applicant may respond.  The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.  In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an [[opposition proceeding]] between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.\n\nOnce granted the patent is subject in most countries to [[maintenance fee (patent)|renewal fees]] to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.  Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the [[European Patent Office]]) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.\n\n====Costs====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.\n\nThe European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.<ref>With the following assumptions: \"18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee\" (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf ''The cost of a sample European patent \u2013 new estimates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201548/http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}, 2005, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Since the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.\n\nIn the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent ([[patent prosecution]]) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.<ref name=\"lemley\">Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001).

Without product patents with which to contend, Indian pharmaceutical companies were able to churn out countless generic drugs, establishing India as one of the leading generic drug manufacturers in the world. Yet in 2005, because of its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), India was compelled to amend its laws to provide product patent protection to pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to satisfy the competing demands for inexpensive drugs and effective intellectual property protection, the Indian government created a law that afforded protection to pharmaceuticals only if they constituted brand new chemical substances or enhanced the therapeutic \u201cefficacy\u201d of known substances. This law, which is codified under section 3(d) of the Patents ([[Amendment]]) Act of 2005,7 has not sat well with some MNCs, including the Swiss company [[Novartis]]. Following the denial of a patent for its leukemia drug, Glivec, Novartis challenged the validity of section 3(d) under TRIPS and the Indian Constitution. The Indian Supreme Court ruled against Novartis in a decision that has, and will continue to have, broad implications for MNCs, the Indian pharmaceutical industry, and people around the world in need of affordable drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&context=law_globalstudies|website=openscholarship.wustl.edu|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{see also|Societal views on patents|United States Patent and Trademark Office#Criticisms}}\n<!--Please do not add new content here.

The largest city is [[Liep\u0101ja]], the third largest city in Latvia. The regions of [[Semigallia]] and [[Selonia]] are sometimes considered as part of Courland as they were formerly held by the same [[duchy of Courland|duke]].\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[Image:Latvian regions and latvians.png|thumb|right|350px|Historical regions of Latvia, together with Latvian cultural groups; Courland (''Kurzeme'') and [[Semigallia]] (''Zemgale'') in yellow]]\n[[Image:Rundale Pilsrundale Eingangsportal.jpg|thumb|275px|Entrance to the [[Rundale Palace]], the seat of the Dukes of Courland]]\nSituated in western [[Latvia]], Courland roughly corresponds to the former [[districts of Latvia|Latvian districts]] of [[Kuldiga District|Kuld\u012bga]], [[Liepaja District|Liep\u0101ja]], [[Saldus District|Saldus]], [[Talsi District|Talsi]], [[Tukums District|Tukums]] and [[Ventspils District|Ventspils]].\n\nWhen combined with Semigallia and Selonia, Courland's northeastern boundary is the river [[Daugava River|Daugava]], which separates it from the regions of [[Latgale]] and [[Vidzeme]]. To the north, Courland's coast lies along the [[Gulf of Riga]]. On the west it is bordered by the [[Baltic Sea]], and on the south by [[Lithuania]]. It lies between 55\u00b0 45\u2032 and 57\u00b0 45\u2032 [[Latitude|North]] and 21\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 [[Longitude|East]].\n\nThe area comprises 27,286&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10,535 sq.mi.), of which 262&nbsp;km\u00b2 (101 sq.mi.) is made up of lakes. The landscape generally has a low and undulating character, with flat and marshy coastlands. The interior features wooded dunes, covered with [[pine]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], and [[oak]], with swamps and lakes, and fertile patches between. Courland's elevation never rises more than 213&nbsp;m (700&nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\nThe [[Jelgava]] plain divides Courland into two parts, the western side, which is fertile and densely inhabited, except in the north, and the eastern side, less fertile and thinly inhabited.\n\nNearly one hundred rivers drain Courland, but only three of these rivers \u2013 the Daugava, the [[Lielupe]] and the [[Venta River|Venta]] \u2013 are navigable. They all flow northwestward and discharge into the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nOwing to its numerous lakes and marshes, Courland has a damp, often foggy, and changeable climate; its winters are severe.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nIn ancient times the [[Curonians]], a pagan tribe, inhabited Courland.  The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Brethren of the Sword]], a German [[Military order (society)|military order]], subdued the Curonians and converted them to [[Christianity]] in the first quarter of the 13th century. Thus in 1230 the Curonian king Lammekinus (Lamikis)  made peace directly with the papal legate. He accepted baptism, and became a vassal of the pope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Courland|title=Courland - historical region, Europe|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> In 1237 the area passed into the rule of the [[Teutonic Knights]] owing to the amalgamation of this order with that of the Brethren of the Sword.\n\n=== Livonian Confederation ===\n{{main|Livonian Confederation }}\nThe Livonian Confederation was a loosely organized confederation formed by the German-led [[Livonian Order]] and various bishoprics that encompassed much of present-day [[Estonia]] and Latvia.  It existed from 1228 to the 1560s, when it was dismembered during the [[Livonian Wars]].\n\n=== Duchy of Courland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1561\u20131795 ===\n[[Image:Duchy of Courland & Semigallia 1740.svg|thumb|right|340px|The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] and the [[District of Pilten]] as it appeared in 1740]]\n{{main|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Couronian colonization}}\nThe Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a semi-independent [[duchy]] that existed from 1561 until 1795, encompassing the areas of Courland and Semigallia.  Although nominally a [[vassal]] state of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the dukes operated autonomously. In the 18th century Russia acquired great influence over the Duchy; the future Empress [[Anna of Russia]] served as regent there from 1711 until her accession the Russian throne in 1730. After the last of the [[Ketteler|ducal line]] into which she had married died in 1737, she arranged for the Duchy to be given to her lover, [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] instead. \n\nThe Duchy was one of the smallest European nations to colonize overseas territories, establishing short-lived outposts on the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Tobago]] and [[Trinidad]] and at the mouth of the [[Gambia River]] in [[Africa]] on what was then known as [[Kunta Kinteh Island|James Island]].\n\nIn 1795, the last Duke, [[Peter von Biron]], ceded the Duchy to the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nThe former [[Bishopric of Courland]] was directly incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as the [[District of Pilten]] of the [[Wenden Voivodeship|Wenden]] and later [[Inflanty Voivodeship]].\n\n=== Courland as part of Russian Empire ===\nAfter annexation by the [[Russian Empire]], the territory of the former Duchy formed the [[Courland Governorate]].\n\nFrom the time of the [[Northern Crusades]] in the early 13th century, most land was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders.  In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired labourers, occupying a low position in the social scale.\n\n[[Agriculture]] was the chief occupation, with the principal crops being [[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[flax]], and [[potato]]es. The large estates conducted agriculture with skill and scientific knowledge. Fruit grew well. Excellent breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs were kept. [[Liep\u0101ja]] and [[Jelgava]] operated as the principal industrial centres, with [[ironwork]]s, agricultural machinery works, [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], glass and soap works. Flax [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] took place mostly as a domestic industry.  Iron and [[limestone]] were the chief minerals; a little [[amber]] was found on the coast. The only seaports were Liep\u0101ja, [[Ventspils]] and [[Palanga]], there being none on the Courland coast of the Gulf of Riga.\n\n==== Population ====\n{{bar box\n|width = 300px\n|float = right\n|title = Residents of Courland by ethnicity (2011)<ref>[http://data.csb.gov.lv/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=TSG11-061&ti=TSG11%2D061%2E+PAST%C2V%CEGIE+IEDZ%CEVOT%C2JI+PA+STATISTISKAJIEM+RE%CCIONIEM%2C+REPUBLIKAS+PILS%C7T%C2M++UN+NOVADIEM+P%C7C+TAUT%CEBAS%2C+DZIMUMA+UN+PA+DZIM%D0ANAS+VALST%CEM+2011%2EGADA+1%2EMART%C2&path=../DATABASE/tautassk_11/2011.gada%20tautas%20skait%EE%F0anas%20gal%EEgie%20rezult%E2ti/&lang=16]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|titlebar = #ddd\n|bars =\n{{bar percent|Latvians|black|75.8}}\n{{bar percent|Russians|yellow|14.7}}\n{{bar percent|Lithuanians|red|2.6}}\n{{bar percent|Ukrainians|violet|2.5}}\n{{bar percent|Belarusians|blue|2.0}}\n{{bar percent|Poles|Orange|0.7}}\n{{bar percent|Others|purple|1.7}}\n}}\nIn 1870 the population was 619,154; in 1897 it was 674,437 (of whom 345,756 were women); in 1906 it was estimated at 714,200. Of the whole, 79% were [[Latvians]], 8.4% [[Baltic Germans]], about 8% [[Jews]],<ref name=jewsofcourland>Herman Rosenthal [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=831&letter=C Courland] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]</ref> 1.4% [[Russians]], 1% [[Lithuanians]], 1% [[Poland|Poles]], and some [[Livonians]].\n\nThe chief towns of the ten districts were [[Jelgava]] (Mitau), Courland's capital (pop. 35,011 in 1897); [[Liep\u0101ja]] (Libau) (pop. 64,500 in 1897); [[Bauska]] (6,543); [[Jaunjelgava]] (Friedrichstadt) (5,223); [[Kuld\u012bga]] (Goldingen) (9,733); [[Grobi\u0146a]] (1,489); [[Aizpute]] (Hasenpoth) (3,338); [[Il\u016bkste]] (Illuxt) (2,340); [[Talsi]] (Talsen) (6,215); [[Tukums]] (Tuckum) (7542); and [[Ventspils]] (Windau) (7,132).\n\n75% of the population belonged to the prevailing denomination, [[Lutheranism]]; the rest belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. There was a small but vigorous Jewish population.\n\n=== Courland during and after World War I ===\n[[File:OberOst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Public notice of the German ''[[Ober Ost]]'' region including Courland ''(Kurland)'' District in 1917]]\n{{see also|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)}}\nDuring [[World War I]], Courland formed part of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] theatre of operations that saw fighting primarily between forces of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire]]s.  Following Russia's [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Great Retreat]] of 1915, Courland came under control of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s ''[[Ober Ost]]'' commander in the person of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military hero.  (The Russian authorities of the [[Courland Governorate]] were exiled to [[Tartu]] never to return.)  With large territories coming under the ''Ober Ost'''s administration as a result of military successes on the Eastern Front, General [[Erich Ludendorff]] was charged with managing the large area now under its jurisdiction.  Courland District (which included parts of [[Semigallia]]) was made one of three districts of the region, which also came to be known as ''Ober Ost''.\n\nAs Russian rule in the rest of what is now Latvia began collapsing at the end of World War I, [[Baltic Germans]] began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918, competing with [[Latvians|ethnic Latvians]]' moves toward independence.  With the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of 3 March 1918, Russia's new [[Soviet Russian Republic|Bolshevik government]] formally relinquished control of Courland to Germany.  The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by a Baltic German ''Landesrat'', who offered the crown of the duchy to German Kaiser Wilhelm II.  Wilhelm recognised the duchy as a German [[vassal]] that same month.  However, the duchy was absorbed on 22 September 1918 by the [[United Baltic Duchy]].  On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence and on 7 December 1918, the German military handed over authority to the pro-German [[Latvian Provisional Government]] headed by [[K\u0101rlis Ulmanis]].  By January 1919, much of Courland had been overrun by the [[Bolsheviks]]' [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] but the provisional government with the aid of German forces pushed back and took back Courland by April.  Throughout the [[Latvian War of Independence]], much of Courland remained a German stronghold.  Latvia eventually signed a cease-fire with Germany on 15 July 1920, and the [[Latvian\u2013Soviet Peace Treaty|Treaty of Riga]] of 11 August ended the war.\n\n=== Courland as part of interbellum Latvia ===\nAfter World War I, Courland became one of five provinces of the newly formed nation of [[Latvia]].

On 5 August 1940, the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the region along with the rest of Latvia which was made a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the USSR]], the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]].\n\nAt the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer of 1941, the German Wehrmacht's [[Army Group North]] headed by [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]] overran Courland, along with the rest of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] littoral. In 1944 the [[Red Army]] lifted the [[Battle of Leningrad|siege of Leningrad]] and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].  However, some 200,000 [[Germany|German]] troops held out in Courland. With their backs to the [[Baltic Sea]], they remained trapped in what became known as the [[Courland Pocket]], blockaded by the Red Army and by the Red Baltic Fleet. [[Colonel-General]] [[Heinz Guderian]], the Chief of the [[German General Staff]], pleaded with  [[Adolf Hitler]] to allow evacuation of the troops in Courland by sea for use in the defense of Germany.   Hitler refused, and ordered the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Courland to continue the defence of the area. Hitler believed them necessary to protect Kriegsmarine submarine bases along the Baltic coast. On January 15, 1945, [[Army Group Courland]] (''Heeresgruppe Kurland'') formed under [[Colonel-General]] Dr. [[Lothar Rendulic]]. The blockade by elements of the [[Leningrad Front]] remained until May 8, 1945, when  Army Group Courland, then under its last commander, [[Colonel-General]] [[Carl Hilpert]], surrendered to Marshal [[Leonid Govorov]], the commander of the [[Leningrad Front]] (reinforced by elements of the [[2nd Baltic Front]]) on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group consisted of the remnants of some 31 divisions. After May 9, 1945, approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began to be moved to Soviet prison camps to the east. The majority of them never returned to Germany (Haupt, 1997).\n\nCourland remained part of the Latvian SSR within the Soviet Union following World War II.  Courland was no longer an administrative unit under the Soviets but an early Liep\u0101ja Oblast, one of three [[oblasts of the Soviet Union|oblast]]s in Latvia, roughly corresponded to Courland.\n\nWith the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Courland became part of independent Latvia once more and it remains so to this day.  Although Courland is not an administrative entity today, the [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Courland ''(Kurzeme)'' Planning Region]], with an area of {{convert|13596|km2}} and a population of 301,621 in 2008, includes much of the traditional region.

The largest city is [[Liep\u0101ja]], the third largest city in Latvia. The regions of [[Semigallia]] and [[Selonia]] are sometimes considered as part of Courland as they were formerly held by the same [[duchy of Courland|duke]].\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[Image:Latvian regions and latvians.png|thumb|right|350px|Historical regions of Latvia, together with Latvian cultural groups; Courland (''Kurzeme'') and [[Semigallia]] (''Zemgale'') in yellow]]\n[[Image:Rundale Pilsrundale Eingangsportal.jpg|thumb|275px|Entrance to the [[Rundale Palace]], the seat of the Dukes of Courland]]\nSituated in western [[Latvia]], Courland roughly corresponds to the former [[districts of Latvia|Latvian districts]] of [[Kuldiga District|Kuld\u012bga]], [[Liepaja District|Liep\u0101ja]], [[Saldus District|Saldus]], [[Talsi District|Talsi]], [[Tukums District|Tukums]] and [[Ventspils District|Ventspils]].\n\nWhen combined with Semigallia and Selonia, Courland's northeastern boundary is the river [[Daugava River|Daugava]], which separates it from the regions of [[Latgale]] and [[Vidzeme]]. To the north, Courland's coast lies along the [[Gulf of Riga]]. On the west it is bordered by the [[Baltic Sea]], and on the south by [[Lithuania]]. It lies between 55\u00b0 45\u2032 and 57\u00b0 45\u2032 [[Latitude|North]] and 21\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 [[Longitude|East]].\n\nThe area comprises 27,286&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10,535 sq.mi.), of which 262&nbsp;km\u00b2 (101 sq.mi.) is made up of lakes. The landscape generally has a low and undulating character, with flat and marshy coastlands. The interior features wooded dunes, covered with [[pine]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], and [[oak]], with swamps and lakes, and fertile patches between. Courland's elevation never rises more than 213&nbsp;m (700&nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\nThe [[Jelgava]] plain divides Courland into two parts, the western side, which is fertile and densely inhabited, except in the north, and the eastern side, less fertile and thinly inhabited.\n\nNearly one hundred rivers drain Courland, but only three of these rivers \u2013 the Daugava, the [[Lielupe]] and the [[Venta River|Venta]] \u2013 are navigable. They all flow northwestward and discharge into the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nOwing to its numerous lakes and marshes, Courland has a damp, often foggy, and changeable climate; its winters are severe.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nIn ancient times the [[Curonians]], a pagan tribe, inhabited Courland.  The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Brethren of the Sword]], a German [[Military order (society)|military order]], subdued the Curonians and converted them to [[Christianity]] in the first quarter of the 13th century. Thus in 1230 the Curonian king Lammekinus (Lamikis)  made peace directly with the papal legate. He accepted baptism, and became a vassal of the pope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Courland|title=Courland - historical region, Europe|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> In 1237 the area passed into the rule of the [[Teutonic Knights]] owing to the amalgamation of this order with that of the Brethren of the Sword.\n\n=== Livonian Confederation ===\n{{main|Livonian Confederation }}\nThe Livonian Confederation was a loosely organized confederation formed by the German-led [[Livonian Order]] and various bishoprics that encompassed much of present-day [[Estonia]] and Latvia.  It existed from 1228 to the 1560s, when it was dismembered during the [[Livonian Wars]].\n\n=== Duchy of Courland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1561\u20131795 ===\n[[Image:Duchy of Courland & Semigallia 1740.svg|thumb|right|340px|The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] and the [[District of Pilten]] as it appeared in 1740]]\n{{main|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Couronian colonization}}\nThe Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a semi-independent [[duchy]] that existed from 1561 until 1795, encompassing the areas of Courland and Semigallia.  Although nominally a [[vassal]] state of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the dukes operated autonomously. In the 18th century Russia acquired great influence over the Duchy.\n\nThe Duchy was one of the smallest European nations to colonize overseas territories, establishing short-lived outposts on the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Tobago]] and [[Trinidad]] and at the mouth of the [[Gambia River]] in [[Africa]] on what was then known as [[Kunta Kinteh Island|James Island]].\n\nIn 1795, the last Duke, [[Peter von Biron]], ceded the Duchy to the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nThe former [[Bishopric of Courland]] was directly incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as the [[District of Pilten]] of the [[Wenden Voivodeship|Wenden]] and later [[Inflanty Voivodeship]].\n\n=== Courland as part of Russian Empire ===\nAfter annexation by the [[Russian Empire]], the territory of the former Duchy formed the [[Courland Governorate]].\n\nFrom the time of the [[Northern Crusades]] in the early 13th century, most land was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders.  In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired labourers, occupying a low position in the social scale.\n\n[[Agriculture]] was the chief occupation, with the principal crops being [[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[flax]], and [[potato]]es. The large estates conducted agriculture with skill and scientific knowledge. Fruit grew well. Excellent breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs were kept. [[Liep\u0101ja]] and [[Jelgava]] operated as the principal industrial centres, with [[ironwork]]s, agricultural machinery works, [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], glass and soap works. Flax [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] took place mostly as a domestic industry.  Iron and [[limestone]] were the chief minerals; a little [[amber]] was found on the coast. The only seaports were Liep\u0101ja, [[Ventspils]] and [[Palanga]], there being none on the Courland coast of the Gulf of Riga.\n\n==== Population ====\n{{bar box\n|width = 300px\n|float = right\n|title = Residents of Courland by ethnicity (2011)<ref>[http://data.csb.gov.lv/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=TSG11-061&ti=TSG11%2D061%2E+PAST%C2V%CEGIE+IEDZ%CEVOT%C2JI+PA+STATISTISKAJIEM+RE%CCIONIEM%2C+REPUBLIKAS+PILS%C7T%C2M++UN+NOVADIEM+P%C7C+TAUT%CEBAS%2C+DZIMUMA+UN+PA+DZIM%D0ANAS+VALST%CEM+2011%2EGADA+1%2EMART%C2&path=../DATABASE/tautassk_11/2011.gada%20tautas%20skait%EE%F0anas%20gal%EEgie%20rezult%E2ti/&lang=16]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|titlebar = #ddd\n|bars =\n{{bar percent|Latvians|black|75.8}}\n{{bar percent|Russians|yellow|14.7}}\n{{bar percent|Lithuanians|red|2.6}}\n{{bar percent|Ukrainians|violet|2.5}}\n{{bar percent|Belarusians|blue|2.0}}\n{{bar percent|Poles|Orange|0.7}}\n{{bar percent|Others|purple|1.7}}\n}}\nIn 1870 the population was 619,154; in 1897 it was 674,437 (of whom 345,756 were women); in 1906 it was estimated at 714,200. Of the whole, 79% were [[Latvians]], 8.4% [[Baltic Germans]], about 8% [[Jews]],<ref name=jewsofcourland>Herman Rosenthal [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=831&letter=C Courland] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]</ref> 1.4% [[Russians]], 1% [[Lithuanians]], 1% [[Poland|Poles]], and some [[Livonians]].\n\nThe chief towns of the ten districts were [[Jelgava]] (Mitau), Courland's capital (pop. 35,011 in 1897); [[Liep\u0101ja]] (Libau) (pop. 64,500 in 1897); [[Bauska]] (6,543); [[Jaunjelgava]] (Friedrichstadt) (5,223); [[Kuld\u012bga]] (Goldingen) (9,733); [[Grobi\u0146a]] (1,489); [[Aizpute]] (Hasenpoth) (3,338); [[Il\u016bkste]] (Illuxt) (2,340); [[Talsi]] (Talsen) (6,215); [[Tukums]] (Tuckum) (7542); and [[Ventspils]] (Windau) (7,132).\n\n75% of the population belonged to the prevailing denomination, [[Lutheranism]]; the rest belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. There was a small but vigorous Jewish population.\n\n=== Courland during and after World War I ===\n[[File:OberOst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Public notice of the German ''[[Ober Ost]]'' region including Courland ''(Kurland)'' District in 1917]]\n{{see also|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)}}\nDuring [[World War I]], Courland formed part of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] theatre of operations that saw fighting primarily between forces of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire]]s.  Following Russia's [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Great Retreat]] of 1915, Courland came under control of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s ''[[Ober Ost]]'' commander in the person of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military hero.  (The Russian authorities of the [[Courland Governorate]] were exiled to [[Tartu]] never to return.)  With large territories coming under the ''Ober Ost'''s administration as a result of military successes on the Eastern Front, General [[Erich Ludendorff]] was charged with managing the large area now under its jurisdiction.  Courland District (which included parts of [[Semigallia]]) was made one of three districts of the region, which also came to be known as ''Ober Ost''.\n\nAs Russian rule in the rest of what is now Latvia began collapsing at the end of World War I, [[Baltic Germans]] began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918, competing with [[Latvians|ethnic Latvians]]' moves toward independence.  With the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of 3 March 1918, Russia's new [[Soviet Russian Republic|Bolshevik government]] formally relinquished control of Courland to Germany.  The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by a Baltic German ''Landesrat'', who offered the crown of the duchy to German Kaiser Wilhelm II.  Wilhelm recognised the duchy as a German [[vassal]] that same month.  However, the duchy was absorbed on 22 September 1918 by the [[United Baltic Duchy]].  On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence and on 7 December 1918, the German military handed over authority to the pro-German [[Latvian Provisional Government]] headed by [[K\u0101rlis Ulmanis]].  By January 1919, much of Courland had been overrun by the [[Bolsheviks]]' [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] but the provisional government with the aid of German forces pushed back and took back Courland by April.  Throughout the [[Latvian War of Independence]], much of Courland remained a German stronghold.  Latvia eventually signed a cease-fire with Germany on 15 July 1920, and the [[Latvian\u2013Soviet Peace Treaty|Treaty of Riga]] of 11 August ended the war.\n\n=== Courland as part of interbellum Latvia ===\nAfter World War I, Courland became one of five provinces of the newly formed nation of [[Latvia]].  These provinces corresponded to Latvia's four traditional regions plus Riga.

On 5 August 1940, the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the region along with the rest of Latvia which was made a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the USSR]], the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]].\n\nAt the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer of 1941, the German Wehrmacht's [[Army Group North]] headed by [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]] overran Courland, along with the rest of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] littoral. In 1944 the [[Red Army]] lifted the [[Battle of Leningrad|siege of Leningrad]] and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].  However, some 200,000 [[Germany|German]] troops held out in Courland. With their backs to the [[Baltic Sea]], they remained trapped in what became known as the [[Courland Pocket]], blockaded by the Red Army and by the Red Baltic Fleet. [[Colonel-General]] [[Heinz Guderian]], the Chief of the [[German General Staff]], pleaded with  [[Adolf Hitler]] to allow evacuation of the troops in Courland by sea for use in the defense of Germany.   Hitler refused, and ordered the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Courland to continue the defence of the area. Hitler believed them necessary to protect Kriegsmarine submarine bases along the Baltic coast. On January 15, 1945, [[Army Group Courland]] (''Heeresgruppe Kurland'') formed under [[Colonel-General]] Dr. [[Lothar Rendulic]]. The blockade by elements of the [[Leningrad Front]] remained until May 8, 1945, when  Army Group Courland, then under its last commander, [[Colonel-General]] [[Carl Hilpert]], surrendered to Marshal [[Leonid Govorov]], the commander of the [[Leningrad Front]] (reinforced by elements of the [[2nd Baltic Front]]) on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group consisted of the remnants of some 31 divisions. After May 9, 1945, approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began to be moved to Soviet prison camps to the east. The majority of them never returned to Germany (Haupt, 1997).\n\nCourland remained part of the Latvian SSR within the Soviet Union following World War II.  Courland was no longer an administrative unit under the Soviets but an early Liep\u0101ja Oblast, one of three [[oblasts of the Soviet Union|oblast]]s in Latvia, roughly corresponded to Courland.\n\nWith the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Courland became part of independent Latvia once more and it remains so to this day.  Although Courland is not an administrative entity today, the [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Courland ''(Kurzeme)'' Planning Region]], with an area of {{convert|13596|km2}} and a population of 301,621 in 2008, includes much of the traditional region.  The remainder of Courland is part of the [[Planning regions of Latvia|planning region]]s of [[Riga Planning Region|Riga]] and [[Zemgale Planning Region|Semigallia ''(Zemgale)'']].\n\n== Notable residents ==\n*[[George Henry Loskiel]], (1740\u20131814), born in [[Ance, Latvia|Angermuende]] in Courland, [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] [[clergyman]] who obtained complete separation of the European and American branches of the church.<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\">{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607\u20131896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}</ref>\n\n* [[Dorothea von Medem]] (1761-1821), Duchess of Courland, wife of the last Duke of Courland.\n* [[Ephraim Deinard]] ( 1846\u20131930), born in Valdemarpils, publisher and author.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Latvia}}\n* [[Elisa von der Recke]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Courland}}\n\n== References ==\n* Murray, John, ''Russia, Poland, and Finland, \u2013 Handbook for Travellers'', 3rd revised edition, London, 1875.

Kabal was introduced in ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' as a former member of [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Black Dragon criminal organization who had reformed as a force for good and thus became one of the chosen defenders of Earthrealm, while notably suffering an attack by Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]]'s extermination squads that left his face disfigured and thus concealed behind a mask. In the three-dimensional ''Mortal Kombat'' games, he returns to the side of evil by reforming the Black Dragon and feuding with [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Mavado|Mavado]], leader of their bitter rival, the Red Dragon. Kabal returns to the side of good in the 2011 [[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]], again having quit the Black Dragon and fighting alongside [[Stryker (Mortal Kombat)|Kurtis Stryker]] to defend Earthrealm against Kahn's forces. After a cameo appearance in [[Mortal Kombat X]] as an [[Non-player character|NPC]] character, Kabal is playable in the latest installment of the franchise, [[Mortal Kombat 11]]. He was revealed on a live stream entitled 'Kombat Kast' by the games' developers.\n\nConsidered one of the most powerful characters in both ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the 2011 reboot, Kabal has received mostly positive fan and critical reception in this regard, but response to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves has been decisively mixed. He has played a fairly scant role in both the overall series continuity as well as in alternative ''Mortal Kombat''-related media and merchandising. Also kabal was added as a Minecraft dlc where if you pre ordered him you would get one red cherry coke and a piece of chocolate that was already half eaten by the cast of Jurassic park back in 1992, yes the candy bar is 28 years old.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nMaking his debut in 1995's ''Mortal Kombat 3,'' Kabal was a member of the Black Dragon crime syndicate alongside [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], until Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion took Earthrealm by storm. Kabal's soul was spared, meaning he was now one of [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s chosen warriors who would defend Earth. This consequently made him a target of Kahn's extermination squads, who subjected him to a vicious attack that left Kabal badly maimed and forcing him thereafter to rely on artificial respirators for survival, all while wearing a mask to hide his now disfigured face. However, the assault had also resulted in a change for the better as Kabal abandoned his life of crime in order to fight alongside the Earth warriors in successfully thwarting Kahn and his forces.<ref>[http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/games/mk3/kabal/ Mortal Kombat 3: Kabal] - Mortal Kombat Online.

Kabal was introduced in ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' as a former member of [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Black Dragon criminal organization who had reformed as a force for good and thus became one of the chosen defenders of Earthrealm, while notably suffering an attack by Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]]'s extermination squads that left his face disfigured and thus concealed behind a mask. In the three-dimensional ''Mortal Kombat'' games, he returns to the side of evil by reforming the Black Dragon and feuding with [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Mavado|Mavado]], leader of their bitter rival, the Red Dragon. Kabal returns to the side of good in the 2011 [[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]], again having quit the Black Dragon and fighting alongside [[Stryker (Mortal Kombat)|Kurtis Stryker]] to defend Earthrealm against Kahn's forces. After a cameo appearance in [[Mortal Kombat X]] as an [[Non-player character|NPC]] character, Kabal is playable in the latest installment of the franchise, [[Mortal Kombat 11]]. He was revealed on a live stream entitled 'Kombat Kast' by the games' developers.\n\nConsidered one of the most powerful characters in both ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the 2011 reboot, Kabal has received mostly positive fan and critical reception in this regard, but response to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves has been decisively mixed. He has played a fairly scant role in both the overall series continuity as well as in alternative ''Mortal Kombat''-related media and merchandising.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nMaking his debut in 1995's ''Mortal Kombat 3,'' Kabal was a member of the Black Dragon crime syndicate alongside [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], until Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion took Earthrealm by storm. Kabal's soul was spared, meaning he was now one of [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s chosen warriors who would defend Earth. This consequently made him a target of Kahn's extermination squads, who subjected him to a vicious attack that left Kabal badly maimed and forcing him thereafter to rely on artificial respirators for survival, all while wearing a mask to hide his now disfigured face. However, the assault had also resulted in a change for the better as Kabal abandoned his life of crime in order to fight alongside the Earth warriors in successfully thwarting Kahn and his forces.<ref>[http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/games/mk3/kabal/ Mortal Kombat 3: Kabal] - Mortal Kombat Online.

In a subplot original to the show, he rescues Sonya after she is injured in battle inside an old theater, and takes her to safety inside an abandoned subway, where he unmasks and she is shocked at seeing his mutilated face. Their friendship deepens after she expresses disgust over the prejudice he faces due to his disfigurement and is saddened at Raiden's explanation of Kabal's ordeal. After he helps the Earth defenders to victory over the Black Dragon, Kabal is extended the opportunity of a permanent position with the Earthrealmers but respectfully turns down the offer, opting to continue his battle against evil alone.

AQAP propagated that the U.S. bombing of Yemen and categorically targeting women and children. Thus they used this alleged targeting as justification of [[Omar al-Faruq]]'s\n<!-- contributor confused [[Omar al-Faruq]] with [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] (the underwear bomber) -->attack as retaliation. \"Al-Qaeda says that violence is just retribution for Western injustices and that Islam authorizes this position.\"<ref>Raymond Ibrahim, ''The Al Qaeda Reader'', 6.</ref>\n\n===Call to individual jihad===\nThe articles inside ''Inspire'' were used to incite rage against non-believers and the West. The Recruiting pitch was based on the conspiracy theories and through the ideology of defensive jihad. The periodical explained what to expect in jihad and the theory of open front jihad and individual jihad. The arguments presented explained the difficulty of an open front engagement with American forces and the difficulty of traveling overseas to conduct jihad. Therefore, the solution for Muslims was individual obligatory (fard'ayn) jihad to attack while the Islamic nation was strategically weak.  \n\n<blockquote>[S]pontatenous [sic] operations performed by individuals and cells here and there over the whole world, without connections between them, have put the local and international intelligence apparatus in a state of confusion, as arresting the members of aborted cells does not influence the operational activities of others who are not connected with them.<ref>Abu Mus Ab Al-Suri, \"The Jihadi Experience: The Open Fronts and The Individual Initiative,\" ''Inspire'', (Fall 2010): 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===\"Open source jihad\"===\n''Inspire'' promoted \"open source jihad\". This shifted away from al-Qaeda's traditional terrorist attacks to simple attacks by individuals using common items for weapons. The Summer 2010 issue advised making a [[pressure cooker bomb]] using everyday materials (\"How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom\").\n\nThe Fall 2010 issue encouraged using one's car to \"mow down\" people in crowded places (\"The ultimate mowing machine\"). The Winter 2010 issue discussed how to blow up buildings. These provided individuals with simple ideas for terror attacks, without direct ties to al-Qaeda or its affiliates. It had become too great a threat to travel abroad and receive training in al-Qaeda training camps, and direct contact with al-Qaeda members endangered the member and the aspiring terrorist. Therefore AQAP's \"open source jihad\" promoted attacks without the support of a physical community. Marc Sageman, a leading expert in the field, described this phenomenon as \"leaderless Jihad\".<ref>Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, (Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008).</ref> While he considered this threat as \"self-limiting\" and one that would quickly die out, the difficulties in stopping the lone wolf attackers were great.\n\n\"Open source jihad\" emerged as a necessary tactic as al-Qaeda leadership steadily vanished in the ten years since 9/11. With leaders either dead or in jail, al-Qaeda had to consider new ways to attack its enemies.<ref name=\"The al-Qaeda Brand Died Last Week\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2011/10/06/the-al-qaeda-brand-died-last-week/ |title=The al-Qaeda Brand Died Last Week|publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref>  Al-Qaeda first splintered into \"franchises\" by country or region, then further degenerated into solo operators, mostly of dubious capabilities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfreedman/2011/09/26/al-qaedas-dumbest-terrorists/ |title=Al-Qaeda's Dumbest Terrorists|author=Daniel Freedman|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> ''Inspire'' became an important al-Qaeda brand tool for recruiting, informing, and motivating these open source jihadis.\n\n\"Open source jihad\" allowed for an emotional response to events and validation in smaller, less spectacular attacks, such as [[Arid Uka]]'s [[2011 Frankfurt Airport shooting|attack on American servicemen in Germany on March 2, 2011]].<ref name=\"Souad Mekhennet\">\"Frankfurt attack mystifies suspect's family\".

AQAP propagated that the U.S. bombing of Yemen and categorically targeting women and children. Thus they used this alleged targeting as justification of [[Omar al-Faruq]]'s\n<!-- contributor confused [[Omar al-Faruq]] with [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] (the underwear bomber) -->attack as retaliation. \"Al-Qaeda says that violence is just retribution for Western injustices and that Islam authorizes this position.\"<ref>Raymond Ibrahim, ''The Al Qaeda Reader'', 6.</ref>\n\n===Call to individual jihad===\nThe articles inside ''Inspire'' were used to incite rage against non-believers and the West. The Recruiting pitch was based on the conspiracy theories and through the ideology of defensive jihad. The periodical explained what to expect in jihad and the theory of open front jihad and individual jihad. The arguments presented explained the difficulty of an open front engagement with American forces and the difficulty of traveling overseas to conduct jihad. Therefore, the solution for Muslims was individual obligatory (fard'ayn) jihad to attack while the Islamic nation was strategically weak.  \n\n<blockquote>[S]pontatenous [sic] operations performed by individuals and cells here and there over the whole world, without connections between them, have put the local and international intelligence apparatus in a state of confusion, as arresting the members of aborted cells does not influence the operational activities of others who are not connected with them.<ref>Abu Mus Ab Al-Suri, \"The Jihadi Experience: The Open Fronts and The Individual Initiative,\" ''Inspire'', (Fall 2010): 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===\"Open source jihad\"===\n''Inspire'' promoted \"open source jihad\". This shifted away from al-Qaeda's traditional terrorist attacks to simple attacks by individuals using common items for weapons. The Summer 2010 issue advised making a [[pressure cooker bomb]] using everyday materials (\"How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom\").\n\nThe Fall 2010 issue encouraged using one's car to \"mow down\" people in crowded places (\"The ultimate mowing machine\"). The Winter 2010 issue discussed how to blow up buildings. These provided individuals with simple ideas for terror attacks, without direct ties to al-Qaeda or its affiliates. It had become too great a threat to travel abroad and receive training in al-Qaeda training camps, and direct contact with al-Qaeda members endangered the member and the aspiring terrorist. Therefore AQAP's \"open source jihad\" promoted attacks without the support of a physical community. Marc Sageman, a leading expert in the field, described this phenomenon as \"leaderless Jihad\".<ref>Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, (Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008).</ref> While he considered this threat as \"self-limiting\" and one that would quickly die out, the difficulties in stopping the lone wolf attackers were great.\n\n\"Open source jihad\" emerged as a necessary tactic as al-Qaeda leadership steadily vanished in the ten years since 9/11. With leaders either dead or in jail, al-Qaeda had to consider new ways to attack its enemies.<ref name=\"The al-Qaeda Brand Died Last Week\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2011/10/06/the-al-qaeda-brand-died-last-week/ |title=The al-Qaeda Brand Died Last Week|publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref>  Al-Qaeda first splintered into \"franchises\" by country or region, then further degenerated into solo operators, mostly of dubious capabilities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfreedman/2011/09/26/al-qaedas-dumbest-terrorists/ |title=Al-Qaeda's Dumbest Terrorists|author=Daniel Freedman|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> ''Inspire'' became an important al-Qaeda brand tool for recruiting, informing, and motivating these open source jihadis.\n\n\"Open source jihad\" allowed for an emotional response to events and validation in smaller, less spectacular attacks, such as [[Arid Uka]]'s [[2011 Frankfurt Airport shooting|attack on American servicemen in Germany on March 2, 2011]].<ref name=\"Souad Mekhennet\">\"Frankfurt attack mystifies suspect's family\".

'''Branchia''' (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills (from Ancient Greek).\n\nWith the exception of some aquatic [[insect]]s, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain [[blood]] or [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]], from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects, fish, and [[amphibian]]s.

The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near-constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThe gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles, the pseudobranch associated with them often remains, is located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure.<ref name=VB/>\n\nMarine [[teleost]]s also use their gills to excrete osmolytes (e.g. Na\u207a, Cl<sup>-</sup>). The gills' large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the [[osmolarity]] of their internal fluids. Seawater contains more osmolytes than the fish's internal fluids, so marine fishes naturally lose water through their gills via osmosis. To regain the water, marine fishes drink large amounts of [[sea water]] while simultaneously expend energy to excrete [[salt]] through the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] ionocytes (formerly known as mitochondrion-rich cells and [[chloride cell]]s).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=David H.|last2=Piermarini|first2=Peter M.|last3=Choe|first3=Keith P.|date=January 2005|title=The Multifunctional Fish Gill: Dominant Site of Gas Exchange, Osmoregulation, Acid-Base Regulation, and Excretion of Nitrogenous Waste|url=https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/physrev.00050.2003|journal=Physiological Reviews|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97\u2013177|doi=10.1152/physrev.00050.2003|issn=0031-9333}}</ref> Conversely, fresh water less osmolytes than the fish's internal fluids.

Instead, the gills are contained in spherical pouches, with a circular opening to the outside. Like the gill slits of higher fish, each pouch contains two gills. In some cases, the openings may be fused together, effectively forming an operculum. Lampreys have seven pairs of pouches, while hagfishes may have six to fourteen, depending on the species. In the hagfish, the pouches connect with the pharynx internally and a separate tube which has no respiratory tissue (the pharyngocutaneous duct) develops beneath the pharynx proper, expelling ingested debris by closing a valve at its anterior end.<ref name=VB/> [[Lungfish]] larvae also have [[external gills]], as does the primitive [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] ''[[Polypterus]]'', though the latter has a structure different from amphibians.<ref name=VB/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n[[File:Smooth Newt larva (aka).jpg|thumb|right|An [[alpine newt]] larva showing the [[external gills]], which flare just behind the head]]\n\n[[Tadpole]]s of [[amphibian]]s have from three to five-gill slits that do not contain actual gills. Usually no spiracle or true operculum is present, though many species have operculum-like structures. Instead of internal gills, they develop three feathery external gills that grow from the outer surface of the gill arches. Sometimes, adults retain these, but they usually disappear at [[metamorphosis]]. Examples of salamanders that retain their external gills upon reaching adulthood are the [[olm]] and the [[mudpuppy]].\n\nStill, some extinct tetrapod groups did retain true gills. A study on ''[[Archegosaurus]]'' demonstrates that it had internal gills like true fish.<ref>Florian Witzmann; Elizabeth Brainerd (2017). \"Modeling the physiology of the aquatic temnospondyl Archegosaurus decheni from the [[Cisuralian|early Permian]] of Germany\".

The oxygen in these tubes is renewed through the gills. In the [[larva]]l [[dragonfly]], the wall of the caudal end of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|alimentary tract]] ([[rectum]]) is richly supplied with tracheae as a rectal gill, and water pumped into and out of the rectum provides oxygen to the closed tracheae.\n\n=== {{anchor|Plastron}} Plastrons ===\nA '''plastron''' is a type of structural adaptation occurring among some aquatic arthropods (primarily insects), a form of inorganic gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]]s that connect to the tracheal system. The plastron typically consists of dense patches of [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] [[setae]] on the body, which prevent water entry into the spiracles but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle. The physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles, almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air. [[Carbon dioxide]] diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high [[solubility]], while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased. Oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out. However, the water surrounding the insect can become oxygen-depleted if there are no [[water movement]], so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies.\n\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aquatic respiration]]\n* [[Book lung]]\n* [[Fish gill]]\n* [[Gill raker]]\n* [[Gill slit]]\n* [[Lung]]\n* [[Artificial gills (human)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://australianmuseum.net.au/image/Fish-Dissection-Gills-exposed Fish Dissection - Gills exposed] ''Australian Museum''.

To regain the water, marine fishes drink large amounts of [[sea water]] while simultaneously expend energy to excrete [[salt]] through the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] ionocytes (formerly known as mitochondrion-rich cells and [[chloride cell]]s).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=David H.|last2=Piermarini|first2=Peter M.|last3=Choe|first3=Keith P.|date=January 2005|title=The Multifunctional Fish Gill: Dominant Site of Gas Exchange, Osmoregulation, Acid-Base Regulation, and Excretion of Nitrogenous Waste|url=https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/physrev.00050.2003|journal=Physiological Reviews|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97\u2013177|doi=10.1152/physrev.00050.2003|issn=0031-9333}}</ref> Conversely, fresh water less osmolytes than the fish's internal fluids. Therefore, freshwater fishes must utilize their gill ionocytes to attain ions from their environment to maintain optimal blood osmolarity.<ref name=VB/><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]] do not have gill slits as such. Instead, the gills are contained in spherical pouches, with a circular opening to the outside. Like the gill slits of higher fish, each pouch contains two gills. In some cases, the openings may be fused together, effectively forming an operculum. Lampreys have seven pairs of pouches, while hagfishes may have six to fourteen, depending on the species. In the hagfish, the pouches connect with the pharynx internally and a separate tube which has no respiratory tissue (the pharyngocutaneous duct) develops beneath the pharynx proper, expelling ingested debris by closing a valve at its anterior end.<ref name=VB/> [[Lungfish]] larvae also have [[external gills]], as does the primitive [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] ''[[Polypterus]]'', though the latter has a structure different from amphibians.<ref name=VB/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n[[File:Smooth Newt larva (aka).jpg|thumb|right|An [[alpine newt]] larva showing the [[external gills]], which flare just behind the head]]\n\n[[Tadpole]]s of [[amphibian]]s have from three to five gill slits that do not contain actual gills. Usually no spiracle or true operculum is present, though many species have operculum-like structures. Instead of internal gills, they develop three feathery external gills that grow from the outer surface of the gill arches. Sometimes, adults retain these, but they usually disappear at [[metamorphosis]]. Examples of salamanders that retain their external gills upon reaching adulthood are the [[olm]] and the [[mudpuppy]].\n\nStill, some extinct tetrapod groups did retain true gills. A study on ''[[Archegosaurus]]'' demonstrates that it had internal gills like true fish.<ref>Florian Witzmann; Elizabeth Brainerd (2017). \"Modeling the physiology of the aquatic temnospondyl Archegosaurus decheni from the [[Cisuralian|early Permian]] of Germany\".

Gills of various types and designs, simple or more elaborate, have evolved independently in the past, even among the same class of animals. The segments of [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] bear [[Parapodium|parapodia]] many of which carry gills.<ref name=Dorit/> Sponges lack specialised respiratory structures, and the whole of the animal acts as a gill as water is drawn through its spongy structure.<ref>{{cite book|author=Choudhary, S.|title=Teaching of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIfw9sxcxDIC&pg=PA269 |publisher=APH Publishing |isbn=978-81-7648-524-1 |page=269}}</ref>\n\nAquatic arthropods usually have gills which are in most cases modified appendages.

A current of water is maintained through the gills for gas exchange, and food particles are filtered out at the same time. These may be trapped in [[mucus]] and moved to the mouth by the beating of cilia.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite book|author=Roberts, M.B.V.|title=Biology: A Functional Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASADBUVAiDUC&pg=PA139 |year=1986 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=978-0-17-448019-8 |page=139}}</ref>\n\nRespiration in the [[echinoderm]]s (such as [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s) is carried out using a very primitive version of gills called papulae. These thin protuberances on the surface of the body contain [[diverticulum|diverticula]] of the [[water vascular system]].\n\n[[File:Hermit Crab Gills.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caribbean hermit crab]]s have modified gills that allow them to live in humid conditions.]]\nThe gills of [[aquatic insect]]s are [[Trachea#Invertebrates|tracheal]], but the air tubes are sealed, commonly connected to thin external plates or tufted structures that allow diffusion. The oxygen in these tubes is renewed through the gills. In the [[larva]]l [[dragonfly]], the wall of the caudal end of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|alimentary tract]] ([[rectum]]) is richly supplied with tracheae as a rectal gill, and water pumped into and out of the rectum provides oxygen to the closed tracheae.\n\n=== {{anchor|Plastron}} Plastrons ===\nA '''plastron''' is a type of structural adaptation occurring among some aquatic arthropods (primarily insects), a form of inorganic gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]]s that connect to the tracheal system. The plastron typically consists of dense patches of [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] [[setae]] on the body, which prevent water entry into the spiracles, but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle. The physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles, almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air. [[Carbon dioxide]] diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high [[solubility]], while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased. Oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out. However, water surrounding the insect can become oxygen-depleted if there is no [[water movement]], so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies.\n\nThe inorganic gill mechanism allows aquatic insects with plastrons to remain constantly submerged. Examples include many [[beetle]]s in the family [[Elmidae]], aquatic [[weevil]]s, and [[true bug]]s in the family [[Aphelocheiridae]], as well as at least one species of [[Ricinulei|ricinuleid arachnid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joachim Adis, Benjamin Messner & [[Norman Platnick]] |year=1999 |title=Morphological structures and vertical distribution in the soil indicate facultative plastron respiration in ''Cryptocellus adisi'' (Arachnida, Ricinulei) from Central Amazonia |journal=[[Studies in Neotropical Fauna and Environment]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20139 |doi=10.1076/snfe.34.1.1.8915}}</ref> A somewhat similar mechanism is used by the [[diving bell spider]], which maintains an underwater bubble that exchanges gas like a plastron. Other diving insects (such as [[backswimmer]]s, and [[Hydrophilidae|hydrophilid beetles]]) may carry trapped air bubbles, but deplete the oxygen more quickly, and thus need constant replenishment.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aquatic respiration]]\n* [[Book lung]]\n* [[Fish gill]]\n* [[Gill raker]]\n* [[Gill slit]]\n* [[Lung]]\n* [[Artificial gills (human)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://australianmuseum.net.au/image/Fish-Dissection-Gills-exposed Fish Dissection - Gills exposed] ''Australian Museum''.
