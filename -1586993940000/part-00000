A multi-national group of astronauts in the UN spacecraft land, believing themselves to be the first lunar explorers. However, they discover a [[Union Jack]] flag on the surface and a note mentioning Katherine Callender, which claims the Moon for [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nAttempting to trace Callender, UN authorities find she has died but that her husband Arnold Bedford is still living in a nursing home. The home's staff do not let him watch television reports of the Moon expedition because, according to the matron, it \"excites him\". Bedford's repeated lunar claims are dismissed as senile delusion. The UN representatives question him about the Moon, and in flashback he tells them his story.\n\nIn 1899, Arnold Bedford and his fianc\u00e9e, Katherine Callender, known as Kate, meet inventor Joseph Cavor. Cavor has invented [[Cavorite]], a substance that will let anything it is applied to or made of deflect the force of gravity. He plans to use it to travel to the Moon, and for that purpose, Cavor has already built a spherical spaceship. He takes Arnold and Kate with him.\n\nWhile exploring the lunar surface, Bedford and Cavor fall down a vertical shaft and discover an [[insectoid]] population, the Selenites, living beneath the surface. (Cavor coins this name for the creatures after the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of the Moon, [[Selene]]). Bedford attacks a group of Selenites out of fear, killing several, despite Cavor's horrified protests. After escaping from them, the two men discover that their sphere, still containing Kate (because Cavor had brought only two spacesuits), has been dragged into the underground city.\n\nThey find that the city holds a breathable atmosphere, so they remove their space helmets. They are attacked by a giant caterpillar-like \"Moon Bull\" which pursues them until the Selenites are able to dispatch it with their rayguns. Cavor and Bedford see the city's power station, a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] powered by sunlight. The Selenites quickly learn English and interrogate Cavor, who believes they wish to exchange scientific knowledge. Cavor has a discussion with the \"Grand Lunar\", the ruling entity of the Selenites. Bedford makes the assumption that Cavor, and presumably all humanity, is actually on trial, and attempts to kill the Grand Lunar with an elephant gun but fails due to Cavor's interference. Running for their lives, Bedford manages to find their sphere, and he and Kate escape; Cavor voluntarily stays on the Moon.\n\nBedford flies the sphere up a vertical light shaft, shattering the window-like covering at the top, and returns to Earth. He concludes his story by mentioning that they came down in the sea off [[Zanzibar]], and their sphere sank without trace, while he and Kate managed to swim ashore. Cavor's ultimate fate remained unknown to them.\n\nIn the present, Bedford, the UN party and newspaper reporters watch on television the latest events on the Moon, where the UN astronauts have broken into the Selenite city and find it deserted and decaying. The ruined city starts to crumble and collapse, forcing the astronauts to retreat hastily. Seconds later the city is completely destroyed. Bedford realizes that the Selenites must have succumbed to Cavor's common cold virus to which they had no immunity.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Aa 26a claiming the moon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1890s expedition claim the Moon for [[Queen Victoria]]]]\n[[File:Aa 09a nasasuit flagfound.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1960s astronauts find Cavor's party's flag]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] as Bedford\n* [[Martha Hyer]] as Kate\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Cavor\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as Dymchurch registrar\n* [[Norman Bird]] as Stuart\n* [[Gladys Henson]] as nursing home matron\n* [[Hugh McDermott (actor)|Hugh McDermott]] as Richard Challis, UN Space Agency\n* [[Betty McDowall]] as Margaret Hoy, UN Space Agency\n* [[Huw Thomas]]* as announcer\n* [[Erik Chitty]]* as Gibbs\n* [[Peter Finch]]* as bailiff's man\n* [[Marne Maitland]]* as Dr. Tok, UN Space Agency\n<small>* Not credited on-screen.</small>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nHarryhausen was planning on following ''Jason and the Argonauts'' with a version of HG Wells' ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'' when he met with writer Nigel Kneale.

During the story's main events, which take place in the 1890s, the film's Victorian-era astronauts are outfitted in space suits adapted from [[standard diving dress|deep sea diving suits]]. Each is fitted with a 1960s-type [[Aqua-Lung|aqualung]] cylinder worn as a backpack. Their space suits are neither pressurized nor heated or cooled, and they do not wear protective gloves in the vacuum of space and extreme cold and heat found on the lunar surface. There is an important technical issue with the heating and cooling provided: Using rubber-lined diving suits on the Moon is impractical due to the brittleness of natural rubber once it is exposed to a vacuum.\n\nCavor and Bedford have no [[radio]] communication and must make their space helmets touch in order to be able to talk with one another in the Moon's vacuum (the filmmakers violate this rule several times). It is not made clear whether the Selenites have radio. On Earth, the [[history of radio]] was only just beginning when the film's 1890s-set events were unfolding. [[Wireless|Wireless communication]] from the stranded Cavor within the Moon appears later in Wells' novel.\n\nThe spacesuit type worn by the UN Astronauts in the film is actually the Windak high-altitude pressure suit,<ref name=\"spacesuit\">{{cite web|url=http://sayhellospaceman.blogspot.com/search/label/Windak|title=Say; Hello Spaceman|publisher=}}</ref> developed for the Royal Air Force, each fitted with a 1960s-type aqualung cylinder worn as a backpack. These pressure suits would also be used in two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories: [[William Hartnell|William Hartnell's]] final story \"[[The Tenth Planet]]\" and the [[Patrick Troughton]]-era \"[[The Wheel in Space]]\". They also appear in the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy as the costumes for [[List of Star Wars characters#B|Bossk]] and Bo Shek.\n\n==Shooting==\nFilming started 1 October 1963.<ref>'TOM JONES' FILM OPENS HERE OCT. 7: British Adaptation of Novel Stars Albert Finney Johnston Award Established Miss Hyer Plans 'Moon Trip' 3 Return to Movies 'The Suitor' Opens Today New York Times 17 Sep 1963: 31.</ref>\n\nSchneer convinced Harryhausen the movie's commercial prospects would be improved if it was shot in Panavision. \"Ray was terrified of Panavision,\" said the producer. \"All I had to do was suggest something different to \nhim, and he would get nervous. \"<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n\"After you got past the first couple of reels, it was a funny film\", said Juran. \"Lionel was a swell actor. I liked him very much. His performance added immeasurably to the picture's entertainment value. He played it tongue-in-cheek but being such a good comic actor he controlled himself and never went too far. He made a great team with Edward Judd. Their personalities, one against the other, were just perfect\".<ref name=\"juran\"/>\n\n\"It was fun to do but it was bloody hard work,\" said Judd. \"Lionel called it 'acting with chalk marks' because we were pointing at things that weren't there and dealing with blue backing and traveling mattes\".<ref name=\"judd\"/>\n\nHarryhausen would explain to the actors what the creatures would eventually look like just before they shot scenes involving them.<ref name=\"judd\"/>\n\n\"Lionel and I didn't like Jerry's working methods too much,\" said Judd. \"He was more of a technician than an actor's director.

Harryhausen felt this was due to the inclusion of too much comedy.<ref>Kinnard p 54</ref>\n\nSchneer said he preferred the film to ''Jason and the Argonauts'' because \"it was set in the Victorian era, whereas Jason took place in a much further removed period of history. Also, I thought the humor in it was \ndelicious, whereas there wasn't much humor in Jason.\" The producer says Harryhausen felt \"fantasy film fans are dead serious about these pictures and have no sense of humor. So, who am I to quarrel with him?\" <ref name=\"three\"/>\n\nKneale says the final movie was \"all right. It could have been better if it had been a bit less farcical; that would have been more imaginative.\"<ref>Warren p 62</ref>\n==Legacy==\nSchneer says that when the real Moon landing happened in 1966 NASA \"had no footage showing the space capsule separating from the 'mother ship' and landing on the Moon's surface. All they had were shots of Neil Armstrong walking around.\" NASA went to Columbia Pictures and used the opening sequence of ''First Men on the Moon''. \"They used those portions of it which were applicable to their needs,\" said the producer.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\nFollowing the movie, Harryhausen and Schneer did not work together for five years.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==Comic book adaptation==\n* [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]: ''First Men in the Moon'' (March 1965)<ref>{{gcdb issue|id=19027|title=Gold Key: ''First Men in the Moon''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=324897|title=Gold Key: ''First Men in the Moon''}}</ref>\n==Notes==\n*{{cite magazine|first=Roy|last=Kinnard|url=https://archive.org/details/Fantastic_Films_010_September_1979_vol2_no4_c2c-Tranzor-HQS/page/n47/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen|magazine=Fantastic Films|title=First Men on the Moon|page=48-54|date=September 1979}}\n*{{cite magazine|first=Ted|last=Newsom|url=https://archive.org/details/Imagi-Movies_v02n03_Spring_1995/page/n13/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen|title=Dynamation Ray Harryhausen Part Two|magazine=Imagi Movies|volume=2|number=3|date=Spring 1995|page=14-28}}\n*{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-037/page/n37/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen|title=The A to Z of Creating First Men in the Moon|first=Kenneth|last=Walker|date=August 1980|page=38-41}}\n*{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Bill|last=Warren|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-140/page/n51/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen|title=Nigel Kneale Part Two|date=March 1989|page=52-56, 62}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0058100|First Men in the Moon}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|first_men_in_the_moon}}\n* {{Allmovie title|17495|First Men in the Moon}}\n* {{tcmdb title|4568|First Men in the Moon}}\n* {{AFI film|id=22693|title=First Men in the Moon}}\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{H.

During the story's main events, which take place in the 1890s, the film's Victorian-era astronauts are outfitted in space suits adapted from [[standard diving dress|deep sea diving suits]]. Each is fitted with a 1960s-type [[Aqua-Lung|aqualung]] cylinder worn as a backpack. Their space suits are neither pressurized nor heated or cooled, and they do not wear protective gloves in the vacuum of space and extreme cold and heat found on the lunar surface. There is an important technical issue with the heating and cooling provided: Using rubber-lined diving suits on the Moon is impractical due to the brittleness of natural rubber once it is exposed to a vacuum.\n\nCavor and Bedford have no [[radio]] communication and must make their space helmets touch in order to be able to talk with one another in the Moon's vacuum (the filmmakers violate this rule several times). It is not made clear whether the Selenites have radio. On Earth, the [[history of radio]] was only just beginning when the film's 1890s-set events were unfolding. [[Wireless|Wireless communication]] from the stranded Cavor within the Moon appears later in Wells' novel.\n\nThe spacesuit type worn by the UN Astronauts in the film is actually the Windak high-altitude pressure suit,<ref name=\"spacesuit\">{{cite web|url=http://sayhellospaceman.blogspot.com/search/label/Windak|title=Say; Hello Spaceman|publisher=}}</ref> developed for the Royal Air Force, each fitted with a 1960s-type aqualung cylinder worn as a backpack. These pressure suits would also be used in two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories: [[William Hartnell|William Hartnell's]] final story \"[[The Tenth Planet]]\" and the [[Patrick Troughton]]-era \"[[The Wheel in Space]]\". They also appear in the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy as the costumes for [[List of Star Wars characters#B|Bossk]] and Bo Shek.\n\n==Shooting==\nFilming started 1 October 1963.<ref>'TOM JONES' FILM OPENS HERE OCT. 7: British Adaptation of Novel Stars Albert Finney Johnston Award Established Miss Hyer Plans 'Moon Trip' 3 Return to Movies 'The Suitor' Opens Today New York Times 17 Sep 1963: 31.</ref>\n\nSchneer convinced Harryhausen the movie's commercial prospects would be improved if it was shot in Panavision. \"Ray was terrified of Panavision,\" said the producer. \"All I had to do was suggest something different to \nhim, and he would get nervous. \"<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n\"After you got past the first couple of reels, it was a funny film\", said Juran. \"Lionel was a swell actor.

The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born. The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition [1938] of the ''Larousse Gastronomique'' and there gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford Companion to Food |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0 |url-access=registration |first=Alan |last=Davidson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/232 232]}} via {{cite web |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodbreads.html#croissants |title=Croissants |work=The Food Timeline |editor=Lynne Olver}}</ref>|Alan Davidson|''[[Oxford Companion to Food]]''}}\n\nThis has led to croissants being banned by some [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Groden|first=Claire|title=Syrian Rebels Ban Croissants in Aleppo|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/02/syrian-rebels-ban-croissants-in-aleppo/|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=Time|date=2 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001231/http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/02/syrian-rebels-ban-croissants-in-aleppo/|archivedate=7 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many in the [[Arab world]] hold to an alternate origin for the croissant.

It may be flavoured with dried fruit such as [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] or [[raisins]], or other fruits such as [[apple]]s. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with [[almond]] filling.\nIn the [[United States]], sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]], or [[feta cheese]] and [[spinach]]. In the [[Levant]], croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or [[zaatar]]. In [[Germany]], croissants are sometimes filled with [[Nutella]] or [[persipan]]; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with [[lye]] (''Laugencroissant''). In the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], the croissant is typically called a ''Gipfeli''; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.\n\n=== Argentina and Uruguay ===\nCroissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, ''aperitivo'' (a light mid-morning meal), or ''[[merienda]]'' (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as ''medialunas'' (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (''medialunas de manteca'', \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a ''medialuna de grasa'' (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet.\n\n=== Italy ===\nA cousin of the croissant is the Italian ''[[Cornetto (pastry)|cornetto]]'' (in the [[Central Italy|Center]] and [[Southern Italy|South]]) or ''[[brioche]]'' (in the [[Northern Italy|North]]). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the ''cornetto vuoto'' (Italian: \"empty cornetto\") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include ''crema pasticciera'' ([[custard]]), [[apricot jam]] or [[chocolate]] cream. They often come covered with [[powdered sugar]] or other toppings. ''Cornetto'' with [[cappuccino]] at the bar is considered{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to be the one of the most common [[breakfast]]s in Italy.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOn 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in [[Greater Poland]], mainly in its capital city [[Pozna\u0144]]. On this day, the people of Pozna\u0144 buy and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called ''rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie'' (\"[[St. Martin's croissant]]s\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry with a filling made of ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]]'']]\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered a sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese p\u00e2tisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.\n\n=== Spain ===\nBesides of the regular croissant, a variation called \"cuerno\" (meaning \"horn\") is sold. It is half of a croissant stuffed usually with cream.\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nA remote similarity of the croissant shape is the Turkish ''ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi''.

To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.<ref name=\":0\" /> Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other [[Pastry|pastries]]. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C, to best hydrate the ingredients.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|title=Information Sheets- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164457/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second step is the [[Laminated dough|lamination]] process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.\n\nAfter lamination, the dough is formed into its famous [[crescent]] shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe third step is the [[fermentation]] process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast which, during proofing, increase the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":5\" /> The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift,\" the dough expands as water is converted to [[steam]], thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165&nbsp;\u00b0C to 205&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.\n\n==Ingredient functionality during processing==\n\n===Predough===\n[[Gluten]] proteins affect the water absorption and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the predough.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ooms|first=Nand|last2=Pareyt|first2=Bram|last3=Brijs|first3=Kristof|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2016-10-02|title=Ingredient Functionality in Multilayered Dough-margarine Systems and the Resultant Pastry Products: A Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=56|issue=13|pages=2101\u20132114|doi=10.1080/10408398.2014.928259|issn=1040-8398|pmid=26177127}}</ref> The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated [[glutenin]] proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated [[gliadin]] proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough\u2019s viscosity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wieser|first=Herbert|date=2007-04-01|title=Chemistry of gluten proteins|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.07.004|issn=0740-0020|pmid=17008153}}</ref>\n\n[[Starch]] also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=H.|last2=Brijs|first2=K.|last3=Veraverbeke|first3=W.

The granules may not be intact, as the process of [[Milling (machining)|milling]] wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the [[viscosity]] of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough\u2019s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Weining|last2=Kim|first2=Yangsoo|last3=Li|first3=Xianyu|last4=Rayas-Duarte|first4=Patricia|date=2008-11-01|title=Rheofermentometer parameters and bread specific volume of frozen sweet dough influenced by ingredients and dough mixing temperature|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=48|issue=3|pages=639\u2013646|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2008.02.008}}</ref> Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter\u2019s incorporation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.<ref name=\":0\" /> As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.\n\n===Lamination===\nIn [[Laminated dough|laminated]] croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Technology of Breadmaking|last=Bent|first=Alan J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387385631|pages=245\u2013274|language=en|doi=10.1007/0-387-38565-7_9|chapter = Speciality Fermented Goods}}</ref> The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.\n\nRoll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In [[Laminated dough|laminated]] dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.\n\nThe type of roll-in fat used is typically [[butter]] or [[margarine]]. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil [[emulsion]]s, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McClements|first=David Julian|date=2010-03-04|title=Emulsion Design to Improve the Delivery of Functional Lipophilic Components|journal=Annual Review of Food Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=241\u2013269|doi=10.1146/annurev.food.080708.100722|pmid=22129337|issn=1941-1413}}</ref> While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.<ref name=\":0\" /> On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 44&nbsp;\u00b0C, at least 3&nbsp;\u00b0C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Baked Products|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=9780470995907|editor-last=Cauvain|editor-first=Stanley P.|pages=72\u201398|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470995907.ch4|editor-last2=Young|editor-first2=Linda S.|df=dmy-all|chapter = Ingredients and Their Influences}}</ref> At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.\n\n===Fermentation===\n[[File:Croissant, cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section, showing texture]]\nCroissants contain yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|title=Rising (fermentation)- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163539/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic [[fermentation]]. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough\u2019s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable <ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of cereal science and technology|last=Carl|first=Hoseney, R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=AACC International|oclc=457130408}}</ref>\n\nIn order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with [[steam]] production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.\n\n===Baking===\n[[File:La parisienne unbaked croissant.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Unbaked dough.]]\nDuring baking, the transient [[gluten]] network turns into a permanent network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=Hans|last2=Slade|first2=Louise|last3=Levine|first3=Harry|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Amylases and bread firming \u2013 an integrated view|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|series=Special Section: Enzymes in Grain Processing|volume=50|issue=3|pages=345\u2013352|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2009.04.010}}</ref> At higher temperatures, intermolecular [[Disulfide|disulfide bonds]] form between glutenin molecules, as well as between [[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant\u2019s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation\u2019s dough lift.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarch undergoes [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] as a result of baking.<ref name=\":3\" /> Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough\u2019s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, [[amylopectin]] crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the same time, [[starch gelatinization]] actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of [[amylose]] leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.\n\nRoll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last=Sievert|first=Dietmar|last2=Hoseney|first2=R.

The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borwankar|first=R.

The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It is important to note that during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.\n\n===Storage===\nThe effect of [[gluten]] proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Geertrui M.|last2=Lagrain|first2=Bert|last3=Ooms|first3=Nand|last4=Fierens|first4=Ellen|last5=Delcour|first5=Jan A.|date=2013-05-15|title=Biopolymer Interactions, Water Dynamics, and Bread Crumb Firming|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=19|pages=4646\u20134654|doi=10.1021/jf4010466|pmid=23631677|issn=0021-8561|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/422718}}</ref>\n\nStarch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. [[Amylopectin]] retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more [[crystalline]] structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. [[Retrogradation (starch)|Starch retrogradation]] actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from [[gluten]] to [[starch]] as a result of [[Retrogradation (starch)|starch retrogradation]]. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous [[starch]] fraction and [[gluten]] network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.a.|last2=Bemiller|first2=J.n.|date=2003-01-01|title=Bread Staling: Molecular Basis and Control|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2003.tb00011.x|issn=1541-4337|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity.

On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion.<ref name=\":2\" /> On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant\u2019s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Croissan'wich]]\n* [[Cronut]]\n* [[Cruffin]]\n* [[Danish pastry]]\n* [[Cornetto (pastry)|Cornetto]]\n* [[List of brunch foods]]\n* [[List of butter dishes]]\n* [[List of French dishes]]\n* [[List of pastries]]\n* [[Torpedo dessert]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''The [[Oxford Companion to Food]]''\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|croissant}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Baked goods with religious iconography}}\n{{Pastries}}\n\n[[Category:Foods featuring butter]]\n[[Category:Austrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:French pastries]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox food\n| name             = Croissant\n| image            = File:2018 01 Croissant IMG 0685.JPG\n| image_size       = 250px\n| caption          = A croissant <!-- no caption needed; these are croissants -->\n| image_alt        = \n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = France <ref name=\"Alto\">{{cite web |last1=Hartley |first1=Alto |title=A Brief History of the Croissant |url=https://altohartley.com/a-brief-history-of-the-croissant/ |website=Alto Hartley |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemmode=lemmasearch&mode=hierarchy&textsize=600&onlist=&word=Kipferl&lemid=GK05212&query_start=1&totalhits=0&textword=&locpattern=&textpattern=&lemmapattern=&verspattern=#GK05212L0|title=W\u00f6rterbuchnetz|website=germazope.uni-trier.de}}</ref>\n| course           = [[Breakfast]]\n| type             = [[Viennoiserie]]\n| served           = \n| main_ingredient  = [[Baker's yeast|Yeast]]-leavened [[dough]], [[butter]]\n| variations       = [[Pain aux raisins]], [[Pain au chocolat]]\n| calories         = \n| other            =\n}}\n\nA '''croissant''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|\u02c8|k|r|w|\u028c|s|\u0252|\u014b}};<ref>''Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014''.

During the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluk period]] (1250\u20131517 CE), a crescent-shaped variant of feteer meshaltet called \"feteer halali\" (crescent feteer) emerged and spread to Europe and France, where it became known as the croissant.<ref name=Israa>{{cite news |last1=\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631 |first1=\u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0621 |title=\u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0643\u0644\u0629..\"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0644\u062a\u062a\" \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0622\u0644\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0646\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644\u0629 \"\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629\" |url=https://www.youm7.com/story/2017/6/8/%D8%AD%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9/3275270 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639 |date=8 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=Amira>{{cite web |author1=Amira |title=Egyptian Feteer Meshaltet |url=https://amiraspantry.com/egyptian-feteer-meshaltet/ |website=Amira's Pantry |accessdate=26 June 2018 |date=24 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=Marzouk>{{cite news |last1=Marzouk |first1=Sarah |title=A Brief History of Fiteer, Egypt's Pizza-Like Pastry |url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/egypt/articles/a-brief-history-of-fiteer-egypts-pizza-like-pastry/ |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=The Culture Trip |date=12 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:APileOfCroissants.jpg|thumb|Baked croissants]]\nUncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any [[praline]], [[almond paste]], or [[chocolate]] before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like ''[[pain au chocolat]]'', which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or [[wikt:savory|savoury]] fillings. It may be flavoured with dried fruit such as [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] or [[raisins]], or other fruits such as [[apple]]s. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with [[almond]] filling.\nIn the [[United States]], sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]], or [[feta cheese]] and [[spinach]]. In the [[Levant]], croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or [[zaatar]]. In [[Germany]], croissants are sometimes filled with [[Nutella]] or [[persipan]]; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with [[lye]] (''Laugencroissant''). In the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], the croissant is typically called a ''Gipfeli''; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.\n\n=== Argentina and Uruguay ===\nCroissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, ''aperitivo'' (a light mid-morning meal), or ''[[merienda]]'' (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as ''medialunas'' (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (''medialunas de manteca'', \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a ''medialuna de grasa'' (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet.\n\n=== Italy ===\nA cousin of the croissant is the Italian ''[[Cornetto (pastry)|cornetto]]'' (in the [[Central Italy|Center]] and [[Southern Italy|South]]) or ''[[brioche]]'' (in the [[Northern Italy|North]]). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the ''cornetto vuoto'' (Italian: \"empty cornetto\") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include ''crema pasticciera'' ([[custard]]), [[apricot jam]] or [[chocolate]] cream. They often come covered with [[powdered sugar]] or other toppings. ''Cornetto'' with [[cappuccino]] at the bar is considered{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to be the one of the most common [[breakfast]]s in Italy.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOn 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in [[Greater Poland]], mainly in its capital city [[Pozna\u0144]]. On this day, the people of Pozna\u0144 buy and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called ''rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie'' (\"[[St. Martin's croissant]]s\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry with a filling made of ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]]'']]\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered a sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese p\u00e2tisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.\n\n=== Spain ===\nBesides of the regular croissant, a variation called \"cuerno\" (meaning \"horn\") is sold. It is half of a croissant stuffed usually with cream.\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nA remote similarity of the croissant shape is the Turkish ''ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi''.

To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.<ref name=\":0\" /> Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other [[Pastry|pastries]]. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C, to best hydrate the ingredients.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|title=Information Sheets- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164457/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second step is the [[Laminated dough|lamination]] process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.\n\nAfter lamination, the dough is formed into its famous [[crescent]] shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe third step is the [[fermentation]] process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast which, during proofing, increase the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":5\" /> The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift,\" the dough expands as water is converted to [[steam]], thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165&nbsp;\u00b0C to 205&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.\n\n==Ingredient functionality during processing==\n\n===Predough===\n[[Gluten]] proteins affect the water absorption and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the predough.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ooms|first=Nand|last2=Pareyt|first2=Bram|last3=Brijs|first3=Kristof|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2016-10-02|title=Ingredient Functionality in Multilayered Dough-margarine Systems and the Resultant Pastry Products: A Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=56|issue=13|pages=2101\u20132114|doi=10.1080/10408398.2014.928259|issn=1040-8398|pmid=26177127}}</ref> The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated [[glutenin]] proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated [[gliadin]] proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough\u2019s viscosity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wieser|first=Herbert|date=2007-04-01|title=Chemistry of gluten proteins|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.07.004|issn=0740-0020|pmid=17008153}}</ref>\n\n[[Starch]] also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=H.|last2=Brijs|first2=K.|last3=Veraverbeke|first3=W.

The granules may not be intact, as the process of [[Milling (machining)|milling]] wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the [[viscosity]] of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough\u2019s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Weining|last2=Kim|first2=Yangsoo|last3=Li|first3=Xianyu|last4=Rayas-Duarte|first4=Patricia|date=2008-11-01|title=Rheofermentometer parameters and bread specific volume of frozen sweet dough influenced by ingredients and dough mixing temperature|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=48|issue=3|pages=639\u2013646|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2008.02.008}}</ref> Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter\u2019s incorporation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.<ref name=\":0\" /> As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.\n\n===Lamination===\nIn [[Laminated dough|laminated]] croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Technology of Breadmaking|last=Bent|first=Alan J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387385631|pages=245\u2013274|language=en|doi=10.1007/0-387-38565-7_9|chapter = Speciality Fermented Goods}}</ref> The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.\n\nRoll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In [[Laminated dough|laminated]] dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.\n\nThe type of roll-in fat used is typically [[butter]] or [[margarine]]. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil [[emulsion]]s, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McClements|first=David Julian|date=2010-03-04|title=Emulsion Design to Improve the Delivery of Functional Lipophilic Components|journal=Annual Review of Food Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=241\u2013269|doi=10.1146/annurev.food.080708.100722|pmid=22129337|issn=1941-1413}}</ref> While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.<ref name=\":0\" /> On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 44&nbsp;\u00b0C, at least 3&nbsp;\u00b0C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Baked Products|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=9780470995907|editor-last=Cauvain|editor-first=Stanley P.|pages=72\u201398|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470995907.ch4|editor-last2=Young|editor-first2=Linda S.|df=dmy-all|chapter = Ingredients and Their Influences}}</ref> At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.\n\n===Fermentation===\n[[File:Croissant, cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section, showing texture]]\nCroissants contain yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|title=Rising (fermentation)- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163539/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic [[fermentation]]. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough\u2019s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable <ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of cereal science and technology|last=Carl|first=Hoseney, R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=AACC International|oclc=457130408}}</ref>\n\nIn order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with [[steam]] production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.\n\n===Baking===\n[[File:La parisienne unbaked croissant.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Unbaked dough.]]\nDuring baking, the transient [[gluten]] network turns into a permanent network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=Hans|last2=Slade|first2=Louise|last3=Levine|first3=Harry|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Amylases and bread firming \u2013 an integrated view|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|series=Special Section: Enzymes in Grain Processing|volume=50|issue=3|pages=345\u2013352|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2009.04.010}}</ref> At higher temperatures, intermolecular [[Disulfide|disulfide bonds]] form between glutenin molecules, as well as between [[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant\u2019s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation\u2019s dough lift.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarch undergoes [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] as a result of baking.<ref name=\":3\" /> Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough\u2019s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, [[amylopectin]] crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the same time, [[starch gelatinization]] actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of [[amylose]] leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.\n\nRoll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last=Sievert|first=Dietmar|last2=Hoseney|first2=R.

The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borwankar|first=R. P.|last2=Frye|first2=L. A.|last3=Blaurock|first3=A. E.|last4=Sasevich|first4=F.

The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It is important to note that during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.\n\n===Storage===\nThe effect of [[gluten]] proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Geertrui M.|last2=Lagrain|first2=Bert|last3=Ooms|first3=Nand|last4=Fierens|first4=Ellen|last5=Delcour|first5=Jan A.|date=2013-05-15|title=Biopolymer Interactions, Water Dynamics, and Bread Crumb Firming|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=19|pages=4646\u20134654|doi=10.1021/jf4010466|pmid=23631677|issn=0021-8561|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/422718}}</ref>\n\nStarch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. [[Amylopectin]] retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more [[crystalline]] structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. [[Retrogradation (starch)|Starch retrogradation]] actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from [[gluten]] to [[starch]] as a result of [[Retrogradation (starch)|starch retrogradation]]. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous [[starch]] fraction and [[gluten]] network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.a.|last2=Bemiller|first2=J.n.|date=2003-01-01|title=Bread Staling: Molecular Basis and Control|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2003.tb00011.x|issn=1541-4337|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity.

On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion.<ref name=\":2\" /> On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant\u2019s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Croissan'wich]]\n* [[Cronut]]\n* [[Cruffin]]\n* [[Danish pastry]]\n* [[Cornetto (pastry)|Cornetto]]\n* [[List of brunch foods]]\n* [[List of butter dishes]]\n* [[List of French dishes]]\n* [[List of pastries]]\n* [[Torpedo dessert]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''The [[Oxford Companion to Food]]''\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|croissant}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Baked goods with religious iconography}}\n{{Pastries}}\n\n[[Category:Foods featuring butter]]\n[[Category:Austrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:French pastries]]\n", "name_user": "95.245.95.58", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(The source says: \"Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates back to the Austrian city of Vienna\")", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant"}

On the north side the town was protected by a large lagoon, which fed into a canal which protected the west side of the town. On the south side of the town, there was the Bay of Cartagena. As a result of this geography, New Carthage benefited for a geography that made it very difficult to assault.\n\n==Background==\nThe Roman commander [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]] sailed to Spain (Iberia) in middle 210 BC, and spent the early part of the winter organizing his army (the total force in Spain was approximately 30,000 men) and planning his assault on New Carthage.\n\nOpposing him were the three Carthaginian generals ([[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal Barca]], [[Mago Barca]] and [[Hasdrubal Gisco]]), who were on bad terms with each other, geographically scattered (Hasdrubal Barca in central Spain, Mago near [[Gibraltar]] and Hasdrubal near the mouth of the [[Tagus]] river), and at least 10 days away from New Carthage.  The Roman campaign was conducted in winter to capture new Carthage using the element of surprise.\n\nLivy mentions that the city garrison comprised 1,000 Carthaginian soldiers under the command of Mago, who picked out a further 2,000 men from the city to defend the front gate and be ready for a sally, and an unspecified amount of townsmen to watch for sudden emergencies.

With the release of A Best 2, Hamasaki also broke many records.\n\nAs of August 2007, A Best 2 has charted in the top 5 of 2007 Oricon Half-Yearly Album 2007 Chart. A Best: White charted as #3 and Black charted as #4; the nearest competitor was Kobukuro with \"All Singles Best\" with sales around 640,000 copies. However, factoring in consistent sales of Kobukuro's \"All Singles Best\", it is predicted that A Best 2 will fall down to #4 and #5, respectively. According to Avex, A Best 2 had sold over 2 million copies as of March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2008/070518.pdf |title=Avex Financial Results of the first quarter of 2007 Page 2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731065458/http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2008/070518.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n'''Oricon Sales Chart (Japan)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"650px\"\n!Release\n!Chart\n!Peak Position\n!Oricon Sales Total\n!Avex Sales Total\n!Chart Run\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|{{start date|df=yes|2007|02|28}}\n|Oricon Daily Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1 <small>(Black & White)</small>\n|170,000\n|200,000\n|1 day\n|-\n|Oricon Weekly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1 <small>(White)</small><br>2 <small>(Black)</small>\n|945,341\n|1,000,000\n|1 week\n|-\n|Oricon Monthly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2 <small>(White)</small><br>3 <small>(Black)</small>\n|646,479 <small>(White)</small>, 632,999 <small>(Black)</small>\n|1,200,000\n|4 weeks\n|-\n|Oricon Yearly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|4 <small>(White)</small><br>5 <small>(Black)</small>\n|1,424,734 <small>(as of 2008)</small>\n|2,000,000\n|52 weeks\n|}\n\n* ''' Total Sales:''' 1,424,734 (Japan)\n* ''' Total Sales:''' 2,000,000 (Avex)\n\n===Taiwan===\n''A Best 2'' as a whole performed very well on the Taiwan Charts.

The two-volume release is a direct successor to ''[[A Best]]'' (2001) and features material from a four-year period of her career. ''A Best 2'' is split between contrasting \"dark\" and \"light\" themes, with the two volumes ''Black'' and ''White'' compiling songs of either nature, respectively.\n\n''A Best 2'' held the top two spots of the ''Oricon'' albums chart in its debuting week, with ''A Best 2: White'' at number one. This made Hamasaki the first female artist since [[Keiko Fuji]] to occupy both positions in 37 years. Both ''A Best 2'' volumes were certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]].<ref name=\"RIAJ-mar2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/gold/200703.html|date=10 April 2007|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]|language=Japanese|script-title=ja:\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u7b49\u8a8d\u5b9a\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e00\u89a7\u30002007\u5e743\u6708|trans-title=Works Receiving Certifications List (Gold, etc) (March 2007)|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==A Best 2: Black==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[HMV]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Black Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/product/detail/2510667|title=''A Best 2: Black'' Review|publisher=[[HMV]]|accessdate=9 May 2011|language=Japanese| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110516074806/http://www.hmv.co.jp/product/detail/2510667| archivedate= 16 May 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n'''''A Best 2: Black''''' includes a previously unreleased track, \"Part of Me\" (featured in a new [[Panasonic]] [[Television advertisement|CM]]) and its accompanying music video.

With the release of A Best 2, Hamasaki also broke many records.\n\nAs of August 2007, A Best 2 has charted in the top 5 of 2007 Oricon Half-Yearly Album 2007 Chart. A Best: White charted as #3 and Black charted as #4; the nearest competitor was Kobukuro with \"All Singles Best\" with sales around 640,000 copies. However, factoring in consistent sales of Kobukuro's \"All Singles Best\", it is predicted that A Best 2 will fall down to #4 and #5, respectively. According to Avex, A Best 2 had sold over 2 million copies as of March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2008/070518.pdf |title=Avex Financial Results of the first quarter of 2007 Page 2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731065458/http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2008/070518.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n'''Oricon Sales Chart (Japan)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"650px\"\n!Release\n!Chart\n!Peak Position\n!Oricon Sales Total\n!Avex Sales Total\n!Chart Run\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|{{start date|df=yes|2007|02|28}}\n|Oricon Daily Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1 <small>(Black & White)</small>\n|170,000\n|200,000\n|1 day\n|-\n|Oricon Weekly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1 <small>(White)</small><br>2 <small>(Black)</small>\n|945,341\n|1,000,000\n|1 week\n|-\n|Oricon Monthly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2 <small>(White)</small><br>3 <small>(Black)</small>\n|646,479 <small>(White)</small>, 632,999 <small>(Black)</small>\n|1,200,000\n|4 weeks\n|-\n|Oricon Yearly Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|4 <small>(White)</small><br>5 <small>(Black)</small>\n|1,424,734 <small>(as of 2008)</small>\n|2,000,000\n|52 weeks\n|}\n\n* ''' Total Sales:''' 1,424,734 (Japan)\n* ''' Total Sales:''' 2,000,000 (Avex)\n\n===Taiwan===\n''A Best 2'' as a whole performed very well on the Taiwan Charts.

Through metathesis the name ''Albanopolis'' entered Slavic where the suffix ''polis'' meaning city became ''i\u0161ta'' with dual meanings of either being a patronymic or indicating a place.<ref

The design of BLITS is based on the optical [[Luneburg lens]] concept. The retroreflector is a multilayer glass sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights.  A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the [[Meteor (satellite)|METEOR-3M]] spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spherical Retroreflector with an Extremely Small Target Error: International Experiment in Space\n |url=http://cddis.nasa.gov/lw13/docs/papers/target_vasiliev_1m.pdf\n |work=13th International Workshop on Laser Ranging. Toward Millimeter Accuracy|publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of the mission was to validate the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept and obtain SLR ([[Satellite laser ranging|Satellite Laser Ranging]]) data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity. The BLITS allows millimeter and submillimeter accuracy SLR measurements, as its \"target error\" (uncertainty of reflection center relative to its center of mass) is less than 0.1&nbsp;mm.  An additional advantage is that the Earth's magnetic field does not affect the satellite orbit and spin parameters, unlike retroreflectors incorporated into active satellites.

The design of BLITS is based on the optical [[Luneburg lens]] concept. The retroreflector is a multilayer glass sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights.  A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the [[Meteor (satellite)|METEOR-3M]] spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spherical Retroreflector with an Extremely Small Target Error: International Experiment in Space\n |url=http://cddis.nasa.gov/lw13/docs/papers/target_vasiliev_1m.pdf\n |work=13th International Workshop on Laser Ranging. Toward Millimeter Accuracy|publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of the mission was to validate the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept and obtain SLR ([[Satellite laser ranging|Satellite Laser Ranging]]) data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity. The BLITS allows millimeter and submillimeter accuracy SLR measurements, as its \"target error\" (uncertainty of reflection center relative to its center of mass) is less than 0.1&nbsp;mm.  An additional advantage is that the Earth's magnetic field does not affect the satellite orbit and spin parameters, unlike retroreflectors incorporated into active satellites.  The BLITS allows the most accurate measurements of any SLR satellites, with the same accuracy level as a ground target.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/lw17/docs/presentations/session6/07-kasi_blits.pdf\n |title=BLITS: spin parameters and its optical response measured by the Graz 2kHz SLR system}}</ref>\n\nThe satellite was inserted into an {{cvt|832|km|||}} [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], with an inclination of 98.85\u00ba.
