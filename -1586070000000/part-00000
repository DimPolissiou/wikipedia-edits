Some have also used more exotic varieties of meat, such as turtle, [[crocodile]], horse, [[lizard]] and snake meat. Most of the time, the meat is cut into small cubes shape, about thumb-size. However, such recipes as Ponorogo use chicken fillet cut into an elongated finger-like shape, thus one skewer holds only one piece.\n\nThe skewers used for chicken satay are traditionally made from ''lidi'', a midrib of coconut fronds. Bamboo skewers might be used instead. For firmer meats, such as lamb, goat, and beef, a thicker bamboo skewer is used. The skewers are usually soaked in water before using to avoid burning during grilling. Each skewer usually holds four pieces of meat, some only three pieces. A goat meat satay might insert a cube of fat between meat cubes. [[Turmeric]] is required to marinate satay to give the dish its characteristic yellow colour. Another popular marinade is [[sweet soy sauce]] mixed with coconut oil or palm [[margarine]]. The skewered meat is seasoned, marinated, and then grilled on [[charcoal]] [[ember]]s.\n\nSatay may be served with a [[spice|spicy]] [[peanut sauce]] dip, or peanut gravy, served with slices of ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'' (rice cakes), and accompanied by ''[[acar]]'' (pickles) consisting of slivers of onions, carrots and [[cucumber]]s in vinegar, salt, and sugar solution.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Satay Ayam | work = Whats4eats | url = http://www.whats4eats.com/poultry/satay-ayam-recipe}}</ref> Mutton satay is usually served with ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) instead of peanut sauce.

While the popular kinds of satay are usually beef and chicken satays, different regions of Malaysia have developed their own unique variations. Sate is often associated with Muslim Malays, but pork sate is also available at non-halal Chinese eating establishments.\n\nThere are a number of well-known satay outlets in [[Kajang]], Selangor which is dubbed the Sate City in the country. ''Sate Kajang'' is a generic name for a style of sate where the meat chunks are bigger than normal, and the sweet peanut sauce served along with a portion of fried chilli paste. Given its popularity, sate Kajang is now found throughout Malaysia. Stalls and restaurants around Kajang offer not only the more traditional chicken or beef satay, but also more exotic meats such as venison, rabbit or fish, as well as gizzard, liver, and a number of other variations.\n\nAnother type of meat satay is the ''sate lok-lok'' from Penang and ''sate celup'' (dip satay) from Malacca. Both are Malaysian Chinese fusions of the hotpot and the Malay satay. Pieces of raw meat, tofu, century eggs, quail eggs, fish cake, offal or vegetables are skewered on bamboo sticks. These are cooked by being dipped in boiling water or stock. The satay is then eaten with a sweet, dark sauce, sometimes with chilli sauce as an accompaniment. If the satay is eaten with satay sauce, it is called sate lok-lok. If the satay is cooked with boiling satay peanut sauce, it is called sate celup. Both dishes are available from street vendors or in certain restaurants, and the majority are not halal. Customers use a common container containing boiling stock to personally cook their satay. Sauces are either served in common containers or individually. There are usually no tables near street vendors, and customers thus tend to gather around the food cart.\n\n===Netherlands===\n[[File:Kipsate met friet.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken satay in the Netherlands with peanut sauce, French fries, prawn crackers, and mayonnaise; as served in a pub in Amsterdam]]\nKnown as ''sat\u00e9'' or ''sateh'', it is fully adapted in Dutch everyday cuisine.

They were moved to the Esplanade Park in the 1960s, where they grew to the point of being constantly listed in tourism guides.\nOpen only after dark with an open air or \"al fresco\" dining concept, the Satay Club defined how satay is served in Singapore since then, although they are also found across the island in most hawker stalls, modern food courts, and upscale restaurants at any time of the day. Moved several times around Esplanade Park due to development and land reclamation, the outlets finally left the area permanently to [[Clarke Quay]] in the late 1990s to make way for the building of the [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]].\n\nSeveral competing satay hotspots have since emerged, with no one being able to lay claim to the reputation the Satay Club had at the Esplanade. While the name has been transferred to the Clarke Quay site, several stalls from the original Satay club have moved to [[Sembawang]] in the north of the city. The satay stalls which opened at [[Lau Pa Sat]] are popular with tourists. Served only at night when [[Boon Tat Street]] is closed to vehicular traffic and the stalls and tables occupy the street, it mimics the open-air dining style of previous establishments. Other notable outlets include the ones at [[Newton Food Centre]], [[East Coast Park Seafood Centre]] and [[Toa Payoh]] Central.\n\nPeanut sauce is used in Singaporean satays, Malay satay is quite similar to Indonesian satay by using ''kecap manis'' (sweet soy sauce), while Chinese Hainan satay uses pineapple [[pur\u00e9e]] sauce and marinated in [[five-spice powder]].<ref name=\"Singapore Hawker Classics\"/> The common types of satay sold in Singapore include ''Satay Ayam'' (chicken satay), ''Satay Lembu'' (beef satay), ''Satay Kambing'' ([[mutton]] satay), ''Satay Perut'' (beef intestine), and ''Satay Babat'' (beef tripe).\n\nSingapore's national carrier, [[Singapore Airlines]], also serves satay to its [[First class travel|First]] and Business Class(previously known as raffles class) passengers as an [[appetiser]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n''Sathe'' as it is known in Sri Lanka is a [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sri Lankan Malay]] dish that has become a staple of the country's diet.<ref name=\"SriLanka\"/> ''Sathe'' is served with peanut and chili sauce.<ref name=\"SriLanka\"/> It is sometimes called ''sate daging'' by the country's Malay community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sri Lankan Malay Recipes |publisher=Galadari Hotel Colombo |isbn= 955-8529-001 |pages=9}}</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\n[[File:Mu sate.JPG|thumb|Thai pork satay]]\nSatay ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e15\u0e4a\u0e30}}, {{RTGS|''sate''}}, {{IPA-th|s\u0101.t\u00e9\u0294\u031a|pron}}) is a popular dish in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satay.com/|title=Satay.com - Cooking Recipes of Thai Food and Asian Cuisine \u2013 Thai Satay Recipes Cookbook|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> Usually served with peanut sauce and [[Thai salads#Other Thai salads|''achat'']], Thai satay have various recipes, from chicken, beef, and pork, to vegetarian variants that employ soy protein strips or tofu.

Some have also used more exotic varieties of meat, such as turtle, [[crocodile]], horse, [[lizard]] and snake meat. Most of the time, the meat is cut into small cubes shape, about thumb-size. However, such recipes as Ponorogo use chicken fillet cut into an elongated finger-like shape, thus one skewer holds only one piece.\n\nThe skewers used for chicken satay are traditionally made from ''lidi'', a midrib of coconut fronds. Bamboo skewers might be used instead. For firmer meats, such as lamb, goat, and beef, a thicker bamboo skewer is used. The skewers are usually soaked in water before using to avoid burning during grilling. Each skewer usually holds four pieces of meat, some only three pieces. A goat meat satay might insert a cube of fat between meat cubes. [[Turmeric]] is required to marinate satay to give the dish its characteristic yellow colour. Another popular marinade is [[sweet soy sauce]] mixed with coconut oil or palm [[margarine]]. The skewered meat is seasoned, marinated, and then grilled on [[charcoal]] [[ember]]s.\n\nSatay may be served with a [[spice|spicy]] [[peanut sauce]] dip, or peanut gravy, served with slices of ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'' (rice cakes), and accompanied by ''[[acar]]'' (pickles) consisting of slivers of onions, carrots and [[cucumber]]s in vinegar, salt, and sugar solution.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Satay Ayam | work = Whats4eats | url = http://www.whats4eats.com/poultry/satay-ayam-recipe}}</ref> Mutton satay is usually served with ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) instead of peanut sauce.

While the popular kinds of satay are usually beef and chicken satays, different regions of Malaysia have developed their own unique variations. Sate is often associated with Muslim Malays, but pork sate is also available at non-halal Chinese eating establishments.\n\nThere are a number of well-known satay outlets in [[Kajang]], Selangor which is dubbed the Sate City in the country. ''Sate Kajang'' is a generic name for a style of sate where the meat chunks are bigger than normal, and the sweet peanut sauce served along with a portion of fried chilli paste. Given its popularity, sate Kajang is now found throughout Malaysia. Stalls and restaurants around Kajang offer not only the more traditional chicken or beef satay, but also more exotic meats such as venison, rabbit or fish, as well as gizzard, liver, and a number of other variations.\n\nAnother type of meat satay is the ''sate lok-lok'' from Penang and ''sate celup'' (dip satay) from Malacca. Both are Malaysian Chinese fusions of the hotpot and the Malay satay. Pieces of raw meat, tofu, century eggs, quail eggs, fish cake, offal or vegetables are skewered on bamboo sticks. These are cooked by being dipped in boiling water or stock. The satay is then eaten with a sweet, dark sauce, sometimes with chilli sauce as an accompaniment. If the satay is eaten with satay sauce, it is called sate lok-lok. If the satay is cooked with boiling satay peanut sauce, it is called sate celup. Both dishes are available from street vendors or in certain restaurants, and the majority are not halal. Customers use a common container containing boiling stock to personally cook their satay. Sauces are either served in common containers or individually. There are usually no tables near street vendors, and customers thus tend to gather around the food cart.\n\n===Netherlands===\n[[File:Kipsate met friet.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken satay in the Netherlands with peanut sauce, French fries, prawn crackers, and mayonnaise; as served in a pub in Amsterdam]]\nKnown as ''sat\u00e9'' or ''sateh'', it is fully adapted in Dutch everyday cuisine.

They were moved to the Esplanade Park in the 1960s, where they grew to the point of being constantly listed in tourism guides.\nOpen only after dark with an open air or \"al fresco\" dining concept, the Satay Club defined how satay is served in Singapore since then, although they are also found across the island in most hawker stalls, modern food courts, and upscale restaurants at any time of the day. Moved several times around Esplanade Park due to development and land reclamation, the outlets finally left the area permanently to [[Clarke Quay]] in the late 1990s to make way for the building of the [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]].\n\nSeveral competing satay hotspots have since emerged, with no one being able to lay claim to the reputation the Satay Club had at the Esplanade. While the name has been transferred to the Clarke Quay site, several stalls from the original Satay club have moved to [[Sembawang]] in the north of the city. The satay stalls which opened at [[Lau Pa Sat]] are popular with tourists. Served only at night when [[Boon Tat Street]] is closed to vehicular traffic and the stalls and tables occupy the street, it mimics the open-air dining style of previous establishments. Other notable outlets include the ones at [[Newton Food Centre]], [[East Coast Park Seafood Centre]] and [[Toa Payoh]] Central.\n\nPeanut sauce is used in Singaporean satays, Malay satay is quite similar to Indonesian satay by using ''kecap manis'' (sweet soy sauce), while Chinese Hainan satay uses pineapple [[pur\u00e9e]] sauce and marinated in [[five-spice powder]].<ref name=\"Singapore Hawker Classics\"/> The common types of satay sold in Singapore include ''Satay Ayam'' (chicken satay), ''Satay Lembu'' (beef satay), ''Satay Kambing'' ([[mutton]] satay), ''Satay Perut'' (beef intestine), and ''Satay Babat'' (beef tripe).\n\nSingapore's national carrier, [[Singapore Airlines]], also serves satay to its [[First class travel|First]] and Business Class(previously known as raffles class) passengers as an [[appetiser]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n''Sathe'' as it is known in Sri Lanka is a [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sri Lankan Malay]] dish that has become a staple of the country's diet.<ref name=\"SriLanka\"/> ''Sathe'' is served with peanut and chili sauce.<ref name=\"SriLanka\"/> It is sometimes called ''sate daging'' by the country's Malay community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sri Lankan Malay Recipes |publisher=Galadari Hotel Colombo |isbn= 955-8529-001 |pages=9}}</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\n[[File:Mu sate.JPG|thumb|Thai pork satay]]\nSatay ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e15\u0e4a\u0e30}}, {{RTGS|''sate''}}, {{IPA-th|s\u0101.t\u00e9\u0294\u031a|pron}}) is a popular dish in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satay.com/|title=Satay.com - Cooking Recipes of Thai Food and Asian Cuisine \u2013 Thai Satay Recipes Cookbook|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> Usually served with peanut sauce and [[Thai salads#Other Thai salads|''achat'']], Thai satay have various recipes, from chicken, beef, and pork, to vegetarian variants that employ soy protein strips or tofu.

As a result, it is most frequently associated with Thai food.<ref name=\"What is Satay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-satay.htm|title=What Is Satay?|work=wiseGEEK|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> For example, in the United States, satay is said to be one of America's favourite Thai dishes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9TK-AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=America's+Favorite+Recipes,+Part+II+Satay#v=onepage&q=America's%20Favorite%20Recipes,%20Part%20II%20Satay&f=false|title=America's Favorite Recipes, Part II|last=Aggarwal|first=Uma|year=2013|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781475977851|language=en}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, as the Thai satay has evolved over time through the use of different marinades, sauces and meats from the original version of the dish, it can be argued that the Thai and Indonesian satays are two different dishes that only share the same name and origin. Due to the global popularity of Thai cuisine and the lower numbers of Indonesian restaurants outside of Indonesia, diners outside the region, particularly those in the West, are more likely to be referring to the Thai version rather than the original Indonesian version when referencing the dish.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.satay.com/contemporary-and-actual-satay-food.html|title=Indonesian Satay |work=satay.com|access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref> A Thai popular street food, ''khao niao mu ping'', grilled pork on a skewer, is believed to be influenced by satay.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://highheelgourmet.com/2014/03/01/grilled-pork-on-skewer-moo-ping/|title=Thai Grilled Pork on a Skewer with Sticky Rice, Khao Niaow Moo Ping|date=2 March 2014|work=The High Heel Gourmet|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first satay restaurant in Thailand was in front of Chaloem Buri Theater near the [[Chaloem Buri Intersection]] in the [[Yaowarat]] [[Bangkok's Chinatown|neighborhood]].

However, since the most popular variant of satay is chicken satay in peanut sauce (''Sate Madura'' in Indonesia, ''Sate Kajang'' in Malaysia, and Thai chicken satay with peanut sauce), in modern [[fusion cuisine]] the term \"satay\" has shifted to satay style peanut sauce instead.<ref name=\"USAPea\"/>\n\nFor example, the fusion \"satay burger\" refers to [[Hamburger|beef hamburger]] served with so-called \"satay sauce\", which is mainly a kind of sweet and spicy peanut sauce or often replaced with gloppy [[peanut butter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheese-burger.net/recipes/peanut-satay-burgers.html|title= Peanut Satay Burgers|website=cheese-burger.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/7375/satay+chicken+burgers|title=Satay Chicken Burgers Recipe|author=NewsLifeMedia|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> The Singapore [[satay bee hoon]] is actually rice vermicelli served in peanut sauce.

{"title_page": "Bracketing", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n\nIn [[photography]], '''bracketing''' is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings. Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image. Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static subjects.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Halford|first1=Elizabeth|title=Bracketing \u2013 What Is It and What to do with the Images?|url=https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/|website=Digital Photography School|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref> [[Autobracketing]] is a feature of many modern cameras. When set, it will automatically take several bracketed shots, rather than the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot. \n\n== Types of bracketing ==\n\n==={{anchor|Exposure}}Exposure bracketing===\n<!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferably by \"#Exposure\".

Technically, this can be accomplished by changing either the shutter speed or the aperture, or, with digital cameras, the ISO speed, or combinations thereof. Exposure can also be changed by altering the light level, for example using neutral-gray filters or changing the degree of illumination of the subject (e.g. artificial light, flash). Since the aim here is to alter the amount of exposure, but not otherwise the visual effect, exposure compensation for static subjects is typically performed by altering the shutter speed, for as long as this is feasible.\n\n[[File:CanonEOS100ViewfinderInfo.JPG|thumb|[[Canon EOS 100]] viewfinder information with AEB]]\n\nMany professional and advanced amateur cameras, including [[digital camera]]s, can automatically shoot a bracketed series of pictures, while even the cheaper ones have a less convenient but still effective manual [[exposure compensation]] control.\n\nExposure bracketing is indicated when dealing with high-contrast subjects and/or media with limited [[dynamic range]], such as [[transparency (photography)|transparency]] film or [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors in many digital cameras.\n\nExposure bracketing is also used to create fade-in or fade-out effects, for example in conjunction with multi-vision [[slide show]]s, or in combination with [[multiple exposure]] or flash.\n\nWhen shooting using [[negative film]], the person printing the pictures to paper must not compensate for the deliberately underexposed and overexposed pictures.  If a set of photos are bracketed but are then printed using automated equipment, the equipment may assume that the camera or photographer made an error and automatically \"correct\" the shots it determines are \"improperly\" done.\n\nImages produced using exposure bracketing are often combined in postprocessing to create a [[high dynamic range image]] that exposes different portions of the image by different amounts.\n\n{{See also|Automatic exposure bracketing}}\n\n==={{anchor|Flash}}Flash bracketing===\n<!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#Flash\". Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\nFlash bracketing is a technique of working with electronic [[flash (photo)|flash]], especially when used as [[fill flash]] in combination with existing light, maintaining the overall amount of exposure. The amount of light provided by the flash is varied in a bracketed series in order to find the most pleasing combination of ambient light and fill flash. If used for this purpose, flash bracketing can be differentiated from normal exposure bracketing via flash, although the usage of the term is not strict.\n\nAlternatively, if the amount of flash light cannot be altered easily (for example with studio flashes), it is also possible to alter the aperture instead, however, this will also affect the [[depth of field]] and ambient light exposure. If the flash to ambient light ratio is to be changed in flash bracketing using this technique, it is necessary to counter-shift the shutter speed as well in order to maintain the level of ambient light exposure, however, with [[focal plane shutter]]s, this is often difficult to achieve given their limited [[X-sync]] speed - and flash techniques such as [[high-speed synchronization]] are not available with studio flashes.\n\n{{See also|Automatic flash bracketing}}\n\n==={{anchor|DOF}}Depth-of-field bracketing===\n<!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#DOF\".

In the first case, it will also change the amount of motion blur in the picture. In the second case, it may visibly affect image noise and contrast.\n\nCombining DOF bracketing with [[multiple exposure]], the so-called ''STF effect'' (for ''Smooth Trans Focus'') can be achieved as implemented in the [[Minolta Maxxum 7]]'s automated [[STF function]]. This closely resembles the [[Bokeh]]-pleasing optical effect of the [[apodization]] filter in the [[Minolta STF 135mm f/2.8 T4.5|Minolta/Sony STF 135&nbsp;mm f/2.8 [T4.5]]]'s special-purpose lens.\n\n{{See also|Smooth Trans Focus function}}\n\n==={{anchor|Focus}}Focus bracketing===\n<!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#Focus\".

Usually this involves the use of software with [[unsharp masking]], a filtering algorithm that removes out-of-focus portions of each exposure. The in-focus portions are then \"stacked\"; combined into a single image. Focus stacking is challenging, in that the subject (as in all brackets) must stay still and that as the focal point changes, the magnification (and position) of the images change. This must then be corrected in a suitable application by transforming the image.\n\n{{See also|Automatic focus bracketing}}\n\n==={{anchor|White}}White balance bracketing===\n<!-- This section is linked from inside or oufftside this article, preferable by \"#White\".

The brightness levels in this case are only altered by increasing or decreasing [[gain (electronics)|gain]], or amplification of the digital signal prior to the conversion to an image file such as a [[JPEG]] or [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF). This type of bracketing must be performed with the camera in Manual mode but is easy to implement simply by shooting a single properly exposed image in RAW and applying exposure compensation in post processing. This is analogous to \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" in film processing, and as in film processing, will affect the amount of \"grain\" or [[image noise]].\n\nIt is also possible to apply a type of ISO bracketing which brackets the signal gain while maintaining a constant level of brightness in the finished photograph. In this case the exposure compensation (EV value) setting remains constant while bracketing the ISO value in Av, Tv, or P mode, which will have a corresponding effect on the shutter speed, aperture value, or both. This form of ISO bracketing could potentially affect not only image noise, but also depth of field and motion blur.\n\nIn-camera [[automatic ISO bracketing]] is uncommon and therefore must usually be performed manually.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Autobracketing]]\n* [[Exposure fusion]], to merge images of different intensities\n* [[Focus stacking]], to merge images of different foci\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Photographic techniques]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n\nIn [[photography]], '''bracketing''' is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings.

She has also battled alongside [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who has developed an unrequited attraction to her, as she never shows affection for anyone but Thor and certain individuals who have proved worthy to wield his hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], such as the noble alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the mortal [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]].\n\nSif has appeared in various media adaptations of Thor. [[Jaimie Alexander]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) and one episode of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] and one episode of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Sif first appeared in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #102 (March 1964). As a supporting character of Thor, she was featured predominantly in the pages of ''The Mighty Thor'', beginning with issue #136 (January 1967). The character went on to make guest appearances in several series including ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'', ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]''.\n\nIn June 2010, Sif starred in a self-titled [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and artist [[Ryan Stegman]]. The issue deals with the aftermath of Loki having taken control of her body and her consciousness being forced into the frame of a dying elderly woman. DeConnick said, \"Well, this is pretty much the story of how she deals with that. She was a bit cowed at first and, for a woman as fierce and proud as Sif, that's insult added to injury. This is the story of how she comes to own that fury and rises to her full stature once again.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/11465/sifs_revenge |title=Sif's Revenge |last=Dietsch |first=TJ |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with issue #646 (November 2012), ''Journey into Mystery'' by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and [[Valerio Schiti]] shifted focus from Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, \"We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 we wanted to mix it up a little bit. Sif's been in the thick of it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40445 |title=Immonen Leads Sif On A \"Journey Into Mystery\" |last=Campbell |first=Josie |date=14 August 2012 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The series was cancelled in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, <blockquote>We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up to the beautiful work that [[Kieron Gillen|Kieron [Gillen]]] et al. had done previously and the amazing reader energy that had been generated. If all that had happened with our ten issues was to extend the influence of the astonishing Valerio Schiti, that would have been enough. As it is, I'm so proud of what Valerio, Jordie [Bellaire], Clayton [Cowles], Pepe and I put on the page under Lauren [Sankovitch] and Jake's fearless leadership. I'm also thrilled to have been able to write Sif as a fierce warrior and a lovable dork. I hope she finds a new home somewhere with a lot of things to say and a lot of things to kill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/14/marvel-cancels-journey-into-mystery |title=Marvel Cancels Journey Into Mystery  |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=14 June 2013 |website=IGN |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nSif, [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]'s sister,<ref name=\"thorsoa3\">''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #3 (June 2004)</ref> has been Thor and Balder's constant companion since childhood.<ref name=\"thorsoa1\">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #1 (May 2004)</ref> Like most Asgardians, Sif was born with golden hair.

The character is depicted commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[List of Germanic deities|goddess]] [[Sif]], she was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #102 (March 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=328}}</ref> As an [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] warrior and lover of Thor, Sif often accompanies Thor into battle. She has also battled alongside [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who has developed an unrequited attraction to her, as she never shows affection for anyone but Thor and certain individuals who have proved worthy to wield his hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], such as the noble alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the mortal [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]].\n\nSif has appeared in various media adaptations of Thor. [[Jaimie Alexander]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) and one episode of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] and one episode of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Sif first appeared in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #102 (March 1964). As a supporting character of Thor, she was featured predominantly in the pages of ''The Mighty Thor'', beginning with issue #136 (January 1967). The character went on to make guest appearances in several series including ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'', ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]''.\n\nIn June 2010, Sif starred in a self-titled [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and artist [[Ryan Stegman]]. The issue deals with the aftermath of Loki having taken control of her body and her consciousness being forced into the frame of a dying elderly woman. DeConnick said, \"Well, this is pretty much the story of how she deals with that. She was a bit cowed at first and, for a woman as fierce and proud as Sif, that's insult added to injury. This is the story of how she comes to own that fury and rises to her full stature once again.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/11465/sifs_revenge |title=Sif's Revenge |last=Dietsch |first=TJ |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with issue #646 (November 2012), ''Journey into Mystery'' by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and [[Valerio Schiti]] shifted focus from Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, \"We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 we wanted to mix it up a little bit. Sif's been in the thick of it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40445 |title=Immonen Leads Sif On A \"Journey Into Mystery\" |last=Campbell |first=Josie |date=14 August 2012 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The series was cancelled in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, <blockquote>We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up to the beautiful work that [[Kieron Gillen|Kieron [Gillen]]] et al. had done previously and the amazing reader energy that had been generated. If all that had happened with our ten issues was to extend the influence of the astonishing Valerio Schiti, that would have been enough. As it is, I'm so proud of what Valerio, Jordie [Bellaire], Clayton [Cowles], Pepe and I put on the page under Lauren [Sankovitch] and Jake's fearless leadership. I'm also thrilled to have been able to write Sif as a fierce warrior and a lovable dork. I hope she finds a new home somewhere with a lot of things to say and a lot of things to kill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/14/marvel-cancels-journey-into-mystery |title=Marvel Cancels Journey Into Mystery  |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=14 June 2013 |website=IGN |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nSif, [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]'s sister,<ref name=\"thorsoa3\">''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #3 (June 2004)</ref> has been Thor and Balder's constant companion since childhood.<ref name=\"thorsoa1\">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #1 (May 2004)</ref> Like most Asgardians, Sif was born with golden hair.

She is manipulated into a new costume change and is sent to face down Eric and Balder in battle, who had willingly followed her, worried for the success of her mission.
