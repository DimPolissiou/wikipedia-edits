When the bank opened on June 9, 1784, the full $500,000 had not been raised; 723 shares had been sold, held by 192 people.  [[Aaron Burr]] had three of them, and Hamilton had one and a half shares.

The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme was said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery. Bank of New York defended itself vigorously, maintaining the fraud accusations were \"flat out wrong\" and warning that as the bank employed 8,700 employees in New York, any damage to the bank would have negative repercussions for the state of New York.<ref name=\"WSJ Civil Suit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203791904576611313866750194|title=US and New York Sue BNY Mellon|last=Mollenkamp|first=Carrick|date=October 5, 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 8, 2011|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Markopolos interview\">{{cite web|url=http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/Broadcast/Entries/2011/10/8_Harry_M._Markopolos.html|title=King World News Interview: Barry Markopolos|publisher=[[King World News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010074041/http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/Broadcast/Entries/2011/10/8_Harry_M._Markopolos.html|archivedate=October 10, 2011|url-status = dead|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution.

The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme was said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery.

Here\u2019s why.}}</ref> Fraga later made a public statement on his personal Facebook page, wherein he decried any negative perception of the group and made clear his understanding of Comicsgate's views and his alignment with them. Fraga stated:\n\n\"\"Because I keep getting asked \u201cWhy are you Comicsgate?\u201d\n\nFirst off, Comicsgate isn\u2019t a hate group. It\u2019s been meticulously painted to look like it is by the opposition. A few months ago I was resistant to join up with them because of their reputation. After looking much deeper into it, I realize that my values, especially the ones regarding the respect of our audience, are in alignment. Regarding the perception that it\u2019s a hate group: I\u2019ve known Ethan for more than 25 years and know he is a good person. Yes, sometimes he can say some controversial things, though its usually satirical with a real point. When people accuse CG of bullying, that bullying is usually a response to an attack. What I am opposed to is bullying in its truest form. When it\u2019s based from bigotry. A few weeks ago I was attacked on Twitter for saying I liked Cyberfrog. All I said was that I felt like I got my money\u2019s worth. What followed was a barrage of name-calling. That same day J Scott Campbell was attacked for drawing the way he draws with people saying that they should break his hands and that he deserves no rights for the way he portrays women. I am adamantly against this and so is CG. I am opposed to those who use tactics like calling someone names like \u201cracist, sexist, misogynist, bigot, or homophobe\u201d to smear that person\u2019s rep, rendering anything they have to say to be filtered by the accusations. All the accused can do is be defensive or angry, only supporting the accusations. I am CG because I respect the fans and won\u2019t be inauthentic or pander to them with characters that are contrived to \u201crepresent\u201d a group type. Denny O\u2019Neil and Neal Adams did it with class back in the day. Nowadays it\u2019s insulting. I am CG so I can be free. If anything, I hope to bring light into what\u2019s perceived as a dark place. Anyone who truly knows me knows I am not down with hate of any sort.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fraga |first1=Dan |title=Because I keep getting asked \"Why are you Comicsgate?\" |url=https://www.facebook.com/danfraga23/posts/10157215561563553 |website=Facebook |publisher=Dan Fraga |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nDan Fraga began his career in the entertainment field as a comic book artist.

The presidency is largely a [[figurehead|ceremonial office]], but the president does exercise certain limited powers with absolute discretion. The president acts as a representative of the Irish state and guardian of the constitution. The president's official residence is {{lang|ga|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]}} in [[Phoenix Park]], [[Dublin]]. The office was established by the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, the first president took office in 1938, and [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|became internationally recognised as head of state in 1949]] following the coming into force of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]].\n\nThe current president is [[Michael D. Higgins]], who was [[2011 Irish presidential election|first elected]] on 29 October 2011. His inauguration was held on 11 November 2011. He was [[2018 Irish presidential election|re-elected for a second term]] on 26 October 2018.\n\n==Ordinary duties and functions==\nThe [[Constitution of Ireland]] provides for a [[parliamentary system]] of government, under which the role of the [[head of state]] is largely a ceremonial one. The president is formally one of three parts of the [[Oireachtas]] (national parliament), which also comprises [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the house of representatives or [[lower house]]) and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] (the Senate or [[upper house]]).\n\nUnlike most [[parliamentary republic]]s, the president is not even the ''nominal'' chief executive. Rather, executive authority in Ireland is expressly vested in the [[Government of Ireland|government]] (cabinet). The government is obliged, however, to keep the president generally informed on matters of domestic and foreign policy. Most of the functions of the president may be carried out only in accordance with the strict instructions of the Constitution, or the binding \"[[advice (constitutional)|advice]]\" of the government. The president does, however, possess certain personal powers that may be exercised at his or her discretion.\n\n===Constitutional functions===\nThe main functions are prescribed by the Constitution:\n;Appoints the government:The president formally appoints the [[Taoiseach]] (head of government) and other ministers, and accepts their resignations. The Taoiseach is appointed upon the nomination of the D\u00e1il, and the president is required to appoint whomever the D\u00e1il designates without the right to decline appointment.  The remainder of the cabinet is appointed upon the nomination of the Taoiseach and approval of the D\u00e1il; as with appointing the Taoiseach, the president is required to make the appointment without the right to appoint someone else.  Ministers are dismissed on the advice of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach must, unless there is a dissolution of the D\u00e1il, resign upon [[motion of no confidence|losing the confidence]] of the house.\n;Appoints the judiciary: The president appoints the judges to all [[courts of the Republic of Ireland|courts in Ireland]], on the advice of the government.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Convenes and dissolves the D\u00e1il:This power is exercised on the advice of the Taoiseach; government or D\u00e1il approval is not needed. The president may only refuse a [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] when a Taoiseach has lost the confidence of the D\u00e1il.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Signs bills into law:The president cannot [[veto]] a [[bill (law)|bill]] that the D\u00e1il and the Seanad have adopted. However, he or she may refer it to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court upholds the bill, the president must sign it. If, however, it is found to be unconstitutional, the president will decline to give assent.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Represents the state in foreign affairs:<ref name=irlpres/> This power is exercised only on the advice of the government. The president accredits ambassadors and receives the [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]] of foreign diplomats. Ministers sign international treaties in the president's name. This role was not exercised by the president prior to the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]\n;Supreme Commander of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]]:<ref>Constitution of Ireland: Article 13.4</ref> This role is somewhat similar in statute to that of a [[commander-in-chief]]. An [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]'s [[commission (document)|commission]] is signed and sealed by the president. This is a nominal position, the powers of which are exercised on the advice of the government. (See [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]].)\n;Power of pardon:The president, on the advice of the government, has \"the right of [[pardon]] and the power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or remit punishment\".<ref>Constitution of Ireland: Article 13.6</ref> Pardon, for [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]], has applied rarely: Thomas Quinn in 1940, Brady in 1943, and [[Nicky Kelly]] in 1992.<ref>[https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1993-11-30/20/ Criminal Procedure Bill, 1993: Report Stage] D\u00e1il debates, 30 November 1993</ref> The current procedure is specified by Section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0040/sec0007.html Petition for grant of pardon.] Criminal Procedure Act, 1993;

While earlier presidents were exceptionally cautious in delivering speeches and on almost every occasion submitted them for vetting, [[Mary Robinson]] and [[Mary McAleese]] made much more use of their right to speak without government approval, with McAleese doing many live television and radio interviews. Nonetheless, by convention presidents refrain from direct criticism of the government.\n\n==Discretionary powers==\n{{anchor|Discretionary powers|Discretionary power|Reserve powers|Reserve power}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\nThe president possesses the following powers exercised \"in his absolute discretion\" according to the English version of the Constitution.  The Irish version states that these powers are exercised ''as a chomhairle f\u00e9in'' which is usually translated as  \"under his own counsel.\"  Lawyers have suggested that a conflict may exist in this case between both versions of the constitution. In the event of a clash between the Irish and English versions of the constitution, the Irish one is given supremacy. While \"absolute discretion\" appears to leave some freedom for manoeuvre for a president in deciding whether to initiate contact with the opposition, \"own counsel\" has been interpreted by some lawyers as suggesting that ''no'' contact whatsoever can take place. As a result, it is considered controversial for the president to be contacted by the leaders of any political parties in an effort to influence a decision made using the discretionary powers. It is required that, before exercising certain reserve powers, the president consult the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]. However, the president is not compelled to act in accordance with the council's advice.\n\n===Refusal of a D\u00e1il dissolution===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\nThe [[Taoiseach]] is required to resign if he has \"ceased to retain the support of a majority in D\u00e1il Eireann,\" unless he asks the president to dissolve the D\u00e1il. The president has the right to refuse such a request, in which case the Taoiseach must resign immediately. This power has never been invoked.  However, the necessary circumstances existed in 1944, 1982 and 1994.  The apparent discrepancy, referred to above, between the Irish and English versions of the Constitution has discouraged presidents from contemplating the use of the power.  On the three occasions when the necessary circumstances existed, presidents have adopted an ultra-strict policy of non-contact with the opposition.  The most notable instance of this was in January 1982, when [[Patrick Hillery]] instructed an aide, Captain Anthony Barber, to ensure that no telephone calls from the opposition were to be passed on to him. Nevertheless, three opposition figures, including [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] leader [[Charles Haughey]], demanded to be connected to Hillery, with Haughey threatening to end Barber's career if the calls weren't put through. Hillery, as Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, recorded the threat in Barber's military personnel file and recorded that Barber had been acting on his instructions in refusing the call.<ref>Fergus Finlay, ''Snakes & Ladders'' (New Island Books, 1998). p.91.</ref> Even without this consideration, refusing such a request would arguably create a [[constitutional crisis]], as it is considered a fairly strong [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the head of state always grants a parliamentary dissolution.\n\n===Reference of bills to the people===\n{{main|ordinary referendum}}\nIf requested to do so by a petition signed by a majority of the membership of the Seanad, and one-third of the membership of the D\u00e1il, the president may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign into law a bill (other than a bill to amend the constitution) they consider to be of great \"national importance\" until it has been approved by either the people in a referendum or the D\u00e1il reassembling after a general election, held within eighteen months. This power has never been used, and no such petition has been invoked. Of the 60 senators, [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|11 are nominated by the Taoiseach]], so there is rarely a majority opposed to a government bill.\n\n===Other===\nThe president may appoint up to seven members of the Council of State, and remove or replace such appointed members. (See [[list of presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland)|list of presidential appointees to the Council of State]].) The following powers all require prior consultation with the Council of State, although the president need not take its advice:\n;Referral of bills to the Supreme Court: The president may refer a bill, in whole or part, to the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court finds any referred part unconstitutional, the entire bill falls. This power may not be applied to a [[money bill]], a bill to amend the Constitution, or an urgent bill the time for the consideration of which has been abridged in the Seanad. This is the most widely used reserve power;<ref name=\"meetingscouncilofstate\">[http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=18&lang=eng Meetings of the Council of State] Office of the President</ref> a full list is at [[Council of State (Ireland)#Referring of bills]].  In a 1982 judgment delivered under such a referral, [[Chief Justice of Ireland|Chief Justice]] [[Tom O'Higgins]] bemoaned the crude strictures of the prescribed process; especially the fact that, if the court finds that a bill does not violate the Constitution, this judgment can never subsequently be challenged.<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/%28WebFiles%29/7FC625DAD10A956C802575F3002D6B7E/$FILE/Housing_%5B1983%5D%20IR%20181.htm In the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the Matter of The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981] 1983 IRSC 185\u20137</ref>\n;Abridgement of the time for bills in the Seanad: The president may, at the request of the D\u00e1il, impose a time-limit on the period during which the Seanad may consider a bill.

Since the establishment of the office this has occurred on six occasions.\n\nThe [[2018 Irish presidential election|most recent presidential election]] was held on 26 October 2018.\n\n==Absence of a president==\n{{main|Presidential Commission (Ireland)}}\nThere is no office of [[vice president]] of Ireland. In the event of a premature vacancy a successor must be elected within sixty days. In a vacancy or where the president is unavailable, the duties and functions of the office are carried out by a presidential commission, consisting of the [[Chief Justice of Ireland|chief justice]], the [[Ceann Comhairle|ceann comhairle]] (speaker) of the D\u00e1il, and the [[cathaoirleach]] (chairperson) of the Seanad. Routine functions, such as signing bills into law, have often been fulfilled by the presidential commission when the president is abroad on a [[state visit]]. The government's power to prevent the president leaving the state is relevant in aligning the diplomatic and legislative calendars.\n\nTechnically each president's term of office expires at midnight on the day before the new president's inauguration.<ref name=\"article 12\">{{cite web|title=Constitution of Ireland|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_Constitution/|accessdate=13 May 2014|quote=Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland defines the exact duration of the president's term of office (date information italicised for the purpose of this footnote): ''''Article 12.3.1:''' The president shall hold office for seven years ''from the date upon which he enters upon his office'', unless before the expiration of that period he dies, or resigns, or is removed from office, or becomes permanently incapacitated, such incapacity being established to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court consisting of not less than five judges.' Also, ''''Article 12.7:''' The first president shall enter upon his office as soon as may be after his election, and every subsequent ''president shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor'' or as soon as may be thereafter or, in the event of his predecessor's removal from office, death, resignation, or permanent incapacity established as provided by section 3 hereof, as soon as may be after the election.'}}</ref> Therefore, between midnight and the inauguration the following day the presidential duties and functions are carried out by the presidential commission. The constitution also empowers the Council of State, acting by a majority of its members, to \"make such provision as to them may seem meet\" for the exercise of the duties of the president in any contingency the constitution does not foresee. However, to date, it has never been necessary for the council to take up this role. Though an outgoing president of Ireland who has been re-elected is usually described in the media as \"president\" before the taking of the Declaration of Office, that is actually incorrect. The Irish Constitution makes it clear that a president's term of office expires on the day before the inauguration of their successor.<ref name=\"article 12\"/> In the [[interregnum]] period, the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|presidential commission]] acts as president, though given that it is usually for less than 11 hours no presidential commission has ever been called on to do anything in that period. Technically for that period the outgoing president is a ''former'' president and, if re-elected, ''president-elect''.\n\nVacancies in the presidency have occurred three times: on the death of [[Erskine Hamilton Childers]] in 1974, and on the resignations of [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]] in 1976 and [[Mary Robinson]] in 1997.\n\n==Official residence, salute, style and address==\n[[File:\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in 2010.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] is the official residence of the president.]]\nThe official residence of the president is [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]], located in the [[Phoenix Park]] in Dublin.

The president is normally referred to as 'President' or 'Uachtar\u00e1n', rather than 'Mr/Madam President' or similar forms. The [[Style (manner of address)|style]] used is normally ''His Excellency/Her Excellency'' ({{lang-ga|A Shoilse/A Soilse}}); sometimes people may orally address the president as 'Your Excellency' ({{lang-ga|A Shoilse}} {{IPA-ga|\u0259 \u02c8h\u0259\u028e\u0283\u032a\u02b2\u0259|}}), or simply 'President' ({{lang-ga|A Uachtar\u00e1in}} {{IPA|[\u0259 \u02c8u\u02d0\u0259xt\u032a\u02e0\u0259\u027ea\u02d0n\u0325]}} ([[vocative case]])).

To highlight the significance of the event, all key figures in the executive (the [[government of Ireland]]), the legislature (Oireachtas) and the judiciary attend, as do members of the [[diplomatic corps]] and other invited guests.\n\nDuring the period of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922 to 1937), the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general]] had been installed into office as the representative of [[the Crown]] in a low-key ceremony, twice in [[Leinster House]] (the seat of the [[Oireachtas]]), but in the case of the last governor-general, [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], in his brother's [[drawing room]]. By contrast, the [[Constitution of Ireland]] adopted in 1937 requires the president's oath of office be taken in public.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nUnder the Constitution, in assuming office the president must subscribe to a formal declaration, made publicly and in the presence of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, judges of the Supreme Court and the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]], and other \"public personages\".<ref name=\"coiart12-8\">Constitution of Ireland: Article 12.8</ref> The inauguration of the president takes place in St Patrick's Hall in [[Dublin Castle]]. The declaration is specified in Article 12.8:\n\n:{{lang|ga|I l\u00e1thair Dia na nUilechumhacht, t\u00e1imse, [ainm], \u00e1 ghealladh agus \u00e1 dhearbh\u00fa go soll\u00fanta is go f\u00edrinneach bheith i mo thaca agus i mo dh\u00eddin do Bhunreacht \u00c9ireann, agus a dl\u00edthe a chaomhn\u00fa, mo dhualgais a chomhl\u00edonadh go d\u00edlis coinsiasach de r\u00e9ir an Bhunreachta is an dl\u00ed, agus mo l\u00e1nd\u00edcheall a dh\u00e9anamh ar son leasa is f\u00f3naimh mhuintir na h\u00c9ireann. Dia do mo sti\u00faradh agus do mo chumhdach.}}<ref name=\"coiart12-8\"/>\n\n:In the presence of Almighty God, I, [name], do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws, that I will fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and that I will dedicate my abilities to the service and the welfare of the people of Ireland. May God direct and sustain me.<ref name=\"coiart12-8\"/>\n\nTo date every president has subscribed to the declaration in Irish. [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], who never learnt Irish and spoke with a distinctive [[Oxbridge]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] that made pronouncing Irish quite difficult, opted with some reluctance for the Irish version in 1973. Pictures of the event show Childers reading from an exceptionally large board where it had been written down phonetically for him. At his second inauguration in 2018, [[Michael D. Higgins]] first made the declaration in Irish, then repeated it in English.\n\nIn 1993 the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] expressed concern that, because of its religious language, the declaration amounts to a religious test for office. The Oireachtas Committee in 1998 recommended that the religious references be made optional.\n\n===Presidential address===\nHaving taken the Declaration of Office, the new president traditionally delivers an address to the guests. Constitutionally all addresses or messages to 'the Nation' or to 'the Oireachtas' are supposed to have prior government approval. Some lawyers have questioned whether the speech at the inauguration should fall into the category requiring government approval. However, as it is impractical to get approval given that the new president is only president for a matter of moments before delivering the speech and so has not had a time to submit it, any constitutional questions as to its status are ignored.\n\n===Religious and humanist involvement===\nInauguration Day involves a lot of ritual and ceremonial. Until 1983 the morning saw the president-elect, accompanied by his spouse, escorted by the Presidential Motorcycle Escort to one of Dublin's cathedrals. If they were [[Catholic]] they were brought to [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] for a [[Pontifical High Mass]]. If they were [[Church of Ireland]], they were brought to [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] for a Divine Service. In the 1970s instead of separate denominational ceremonies a single ecumenical multi-faith service was held in the cathedral of the faith of the president-elect. Some additional religious ceremonies also featured: President-elect [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]] attended a prayer ceremony in a synagogue in Dublin to reflect his longstanding relationship with the [[Jew]]ish Community in Ireland.\n\n[[File:St. Patrick\u2019s Hall Dublin Castle 2014.JPG|thumb|Saint Patrick's Hall, where presidents are inaugurated.]]\nIn 1983, to reduce the costs of the day in a period of economic retrenchment, the separate religious blessing ceremony was incorporated into the inauguration ceremony itself, with the president-elect blessed by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, Methodism, the Society of Friends, and the Jewish and Islamic faiths. This inter-faith service has featured in the inaugurations since 1983. Since 2011, a representative from the [[Humanist Association of Ireland]], representing [[secular humanism|humanism]] and the non-religious population of Ireland, has appeared alongside ministers of a religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2744/irelands-humanist-president|last=Reidy|first=Padraig|work=[[New Humanist]]|title=Ireland's humanist president|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dress codes===\nFor the first inauguration in 1938 President-elect [[Douglas Hyde]] wore a [[morning suit]], with black silk [[top hat]]. Morning suits continued to be a standard feature of Irish presidential inaugurations until 1997 when [[Mary McAleese]], whose husband disliked wearing formal suits, abolished their use for inaugurations (and for all other presidential ceremonial). From then, guests were required to wear plain [[business suit]]s, and judges were prohibited from wearing their distinctive wigs and gowns. Ambassadors were also discouraged from wearing national dress.\n\n===End of the day===\nThe president-elect (unless they are already a serving president, in which case they will already be living in the presidential residence) are usually driven to the inauguration from their private home. After the ceremony they are driven through the streets of Dublin to [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]], the official presidential residence, where they are welcomed by the [[Secretary-General to the President|secretary-general to the president]], the head of the presidential secretariat.\n\nThat evening, the Irish government hosts a reception in their honour in the [[Dublin Castle#State apartments|State Apartments]] (the former Royal Apartments) in [[Dublin Castle]]. Whereas the dress code was formerly [[white tie]] affair, it is now more usually [[black tie]].\n\n==Impeachment and removal from office==\nThe president can be removed from office in two ways, neither of which has ever been invoked. The Supreme Court, in a sitting of at least five judges, may find the president \"permanently incapacitated\",<ref name=\"coiart12-3\"/> while the Oireachtas may remove the president for \"stated misbehaviour\".<ref name=\"coiart12-10\">Constitution of Ireland: Article 12.10</ref> Either house of the Oireachtas may instigate the latter process by passing an [[impeachment]] resolution, provided at least thirty members move it and at least two-thirds support it. The other house will then either investigate the stated charges or commission a body to do so; following which at least two-thirds of members must agree both that the president is guilty and that the charges warrant removal.<ref name=\"coiart12-10\"/>\n\n==Security and transport==\n[[File:Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly being escorted to his inauguration as President of Ireland in 1945.jpg|thumb|The Inauguration of Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly in 1945. The 2nd Cavalry Squadron of the [[Blue Hussars]] escort the president, who travelled in the late [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]'s landau. The Landau and the Hussars were later scrapped.]]\nAs head of state of Ireland, the president receives the highest level of protection in the state. \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in is protected by armed guards from the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] and [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] at all times, and is encircled by security fencing and intrusion detection systems. At all times the president travels with an armed security detail in Ireland and overseas, which is provided by the [[Special Detective Unit]] (SDU), an elite wing of the Irish police force. Protection is increased if there is a known threat. The presidential limousine is a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] LWB. The Presidential Limousine is dark navy blue and carries the presidential standard on the left front wing and the [[Flag of Ireland|tricolour]] on the right front wing. When travelling the presidential limousine is always accompanied by support cars (normally [[BMW 5 Series]], [[Audi A6]] and [[Volvo S60]] driven by trained drivers from the SDU) and several Garda motorcycle outriders from the [[Garda Traffic Corps]] which form a protective convoy around the car.\n\nThe president-elect is usually escorted to and from the ceremony by the Presidential Motorcycle Escort ceremonial outriders. Until 1947 they were a [[cavalry]] mounted escort, wearing light blue hussar-style uniforms. However to save money the first Inter-Party Government replaced the Irish horses by Japanese motorbikes, which the then Minister for Defence believed would be \"much more impressive.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAt the presidential inauguration in 1945, alongside the mounted escort on horseback, president-elect [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] rode in the old state landau of Queen [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra the Queen Mother]]. The use of the state carriage was highly popular with crowds. However an accident with a later presidential carriage at the [[Royal Dublin Society]] [[Horse show]] led to the abolition of the carriage and its replacement by a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith]] in 1947. The distinctive [[Presidential State Car (Ireland)|1947 Rolls-Royce]] is still used to bring the president to and from the inauguration today.\n\nThe [[Presidential State Car (Ireland)|Presidential State Car]] is a 1947 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith]] [[Landaulet (car)|landaulet]]te, which is used only for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe president also has the full use of all [[Air Corps (Ireland)|Irish Air Corps]] aircraft at his/her disposal if so needed, including helicopters and private jets.\n\n==History==\nThe office of president was established in 1937, in part as a replacement for the office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general]] that existed during the 1922\u201337 [[Irish Free State]]. The seven-year term of office of the president was inspired by that of the [[president of Germany (1919\u20131945)|presidents of Weimar Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} At the time the office was established critics warned that the post might lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. However, these fears were not borne out as successive presidents played a limited, largely apolitical role in national affairs.\n\n===Head of state from 1937 to 1949===\n{{Main|Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949}}\n{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2019}}\nDuring the period of 1937 to 1949 it was unclear whether the Irish head of state was actually the president of Ireland or [[George VI]], the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|king of Ireland]]. This period of confusion ended in 1949 when the state was declared to be a [[republic]]. The 1937 constitution did not mention the king, but neither did it state that the president was head of state, saying rather that the president \"shall take precedence over all other persons in the State\". The president exercised some powers that could be exercised by heads of state but which could also be exercised by governors or governors-general, such as appointing the government and promulgating the law.\n\nHowever, in 1936, George VI had been declared \"King of Ireland\" and, under the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]] of the same year, it was this king who represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, therefore, were signed in the name of the King of Ireland, who also accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Irish head of state in the eyes of foreign nations. The [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], which came into force in April 1949, proclaimed a republic and transferred the role of representing the state abroad from the monarch to the president. No change was made to the constitution.\n\n===Evolving role===\nAfter the inaugural presidency of [[Douglas Hyde]], who was an interparty nominee for the office, the nominees of the [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] political party won every presidential election until 1990. The party traditionally used the nomination as a reward for its most senior and prominent members, such as party founder and longtime Taoiseach [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] and [[European Commissioner]] [[Patrick Hillery]]. Most of its occupants to that time followed Hyde's precedent-setting conception of the presidency as a conservative, low-key institution that used its ceremonial prestige and few discretionary powers sparingly. In fact, the presidency was such a quiet position that Irish politicians sought to avoid contested presidential elections as often as possible, feeling that the attention such elections would bring to the office was an unnecessary distraction,<ref name=uachtarainmcaleese>{{cite video |people=Diarmaid Ferriter |date=2007 |title=Uachtar\u00e1in \u2013 Mary McAleese |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121637/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |medium=Television production |language=Irish |publisher=TG4 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=5 January 2011 }}</ref> and office-seekers facing economic austerity would often suggest the elimination of the office as a money-saving measure.<ref name=uachtarainrobinson>{{cite video |people=Diarmaid Ferriter |date=2007 |title=Uachtar\u00e1in \u2013 Mary Robinson |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121637/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |medium=Television production |language=Irish |publisher=TG4 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=5 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the historical meekness of the presidency, however, it has been at the centre of some high-profile controversies. In particular, the fifth president, [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]], faced a contentious dispute with the government in 1976 over the signing of a bill declaring a state of emergency, which ended in \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh's resignation. His successor, Patrick Hillery, was also involved in a controversy in 1982, when then-Taoiseach [[Garret FitzGerald]] requested a dissolution of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. Hillery was bombarded with phone calls from opposition members urging him to refuse the request, an action that Hillery saw as highly inappropriate interference with the president's constitutional role and resisted the political pressure.\n\nThe presidency began to be transformed in the 1990s. Hillery's conduct regarding the dissolution affair in 1982 came to light in 1990, imbuing the office with a new sense of dignity and stability. However, it was Hillery's successor, seventh president [[Mary Robinson]], who ultimately revolutionized the presidency. The winner of an upset victory in the highly controversial election of 1990, Robinson was the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] nominee, the first president to defeat Fianna F\u00e1il in an election and the first female president. Upon election, however, Robinson took steps to de-politicize the office. She also sought to widen the scope of the presidency, developing new economic, political and cultural links between the state and other countries and cultures, especially those of the [[Irish diaspora]]. Robinson used the prestige of the office to activist ends, placing emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the [[Great Irish Famine]] to today's nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries.<ref name=uachtarainrobinson />\n\n===Remuneration and expenses===\nAfter the [[2018 Irish presidential election|2018 presidential election]] the official salary or \"personal remuneration\" of the president will be [[Euro|\u20ac]]249,014.<ref name=\"higgins2011salary\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.president.ie/en/media-library/news-releases/statement-from-president-michael-d.-higgins-regarding-voluntary-salary-redu|title=Statement from President Michael D.

Presidents have attended the ceremony since the 1990s.]]\nThe text of the Constitution of Ireland, as originally enacted in 1937, made reference in its [[Articles 2 and 3]] to two geopolitical entities: a thirty-two county 'national territory' (i.e., the island of [[Ireland]]), and a twenty-six county 'state' formerly known as the [[Irish Free State]]. The implication behind the title 'president of Ireland' was that the president would function as the head of all Ireland. However, this implication was challenged by the [[Ulster Unionists]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] which was the state internationally acknowledged as having jurisdiction over [[Northern Ireland]]. Articles 2 and 3 were substantially amended in consequence of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\nIreland in turn challenged the proclamation in the United Kingdom of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1952 as '[Queen] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. The Irish government refused to attend royal functions as a result; for example, [[Patrick Hillery]] declined on government advice to attend the wedding of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] to [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981, to which he had been invited by Queen Elizabeth, just as [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] had declined on government advice to attend the 1953 Coronation Garden Party at the British Embassy in Dublin. Britain in turn insisted on referring to the president as 'president of the Republic of Ireland' or 'president of the Irish Republic'.<ref group=\"n\">The office of \"[[President of the Irish Republic]]\" existed in the separatist [[Irish Republic]] of 1919\u201321.</ref> Letters of Credence from Queen Elizabeth, on the [[British government]]'s advice, appointing United Kingdom ambassadors to Ireland were not addressed to the 'president of Ireland' but to the president personally (for example: 'President Hillery').\n\nThe naming dispute and consequent avoidance of contact at head of state level has gradually thawed since 1990.  President Robinson (1990\u201397) chose unilaterally to break the taboo by regularly visiting the United Kingdom for public functions, frequently in connection with [[Anglo-Irish Relations]] or to visit the Irish emigrant community in Great Britain. In another breaking of precedent, she accepted an invitation to [[Buckingham Palace]] by Queen Elizabeth II. Palace accreditation supplied to journalists referred to the \"visit of the president of Ireland\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Between 1990 and 2010, both Robinson and her successor President McAleese (1997\u20132011) visited the Palace on numerous occasions, while senior members of the British royal family \u2013 the Prince of Wales, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|the Duke of York]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|the Earl of Wessex]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] \u2013 all visited both presidents of Ireland at [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]. The presidents also attended functions with [[Anne, Princess Royal|the Princess Royal]]. President Robinson jointly hosted a reception with the queen at [[St. James's Palace]], London, in 1995, to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Queen's Colleges in 1845 (the Queen's Colleges are now known as [[the Queen's University of Belfast]], [[University College, Cork]], and [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]).  These contacts eventually led to [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|a state visit]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] to Ireland in 2011.\n\nThough the president's title implicitly asserted authority in Northern Ireland, in reality the Irish president needed government permission to visit there. (The Constitution of Ireland in Article 3 explicitly stated that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\" the authority of the Irish state did not extend to Northern Ireland. Presidents prior to the presidency of Mary Robinson were regularly refused permission by the Irish government to visit Northern Ireland.)\n\nHowever, since the 1990s and in particular since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998, the president has regularly visited Northern Ireland. President McAleese, who was the first president to have been born in Northern Ireland, continued on from President Robinson in this regard. In a sign of the warmth of modern British-Irish relations, she has even been warmly welcomed by most leading [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]]. At the funeral for a child murdered by the [[Real IRA]] in [[Omagh]] she symbolically walked up the main aisle of the [[church (building)|church]] hand-in-hand with the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] leader and then [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[David Trimble]]. But in other instances, Mary McAleese had been criticised for certain comments, such as a reference to the way in which Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been brought up to hate Catholics just as German children had been encouraged to hate [[Jews]] under the [[Nazi]] regime, on 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4214263.stm | work=BBC News | title=McAleese row over Nazi comments | date=28 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2005/01/27/story186673.html BreakingNews.ie: Archives :2005-01-27]</ref> These remarks caused outrage among Northern Ireland's unionist politicians, and McAleese later apologised<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4217545.stm | work=BBC News | title=McAleese 'sorry' over Nazi remark | date=29 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> and conceded that her statement had been unbalanced.\n\n===Suggestions for reform===\nThere have been many suggestions for reforming the office of president over the years. In 1996, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of President should remain largely unchanged. However, it suggested that the Constitution should be amended to explicitly declare the president to be head of state (at present that term does not appear in the text), and that consideration be given to the introduction of a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] system in the D\u00e1il, along the lines of that in Germany. If this system were introduced then the power of the president to refuse a D\u00e1il dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away. The All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's 1998 Report made similar recommendations.\n\nIn an October 2009 poll, concerning support for various potential candidates in the [[2011 Irish presidential election|2011 presidential election]] conducted by the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', a \"significant number\" of people were said to feel that the presidency is a waste of money and should be abolished.<ref name=SI_200091011>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/womans-place-is-still-in-the-aras-poll-26572771.html |title=Woman's place is still in the Aras \u2013 poll |last=Reilly |first=Jerome |date=11 October 2009 |work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]] |accessdate=31 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==List of presidents of Ireland==\nThe functions of the president were exercised by the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|Presidential Commission]] from the coming into force of the Constitution on 29 December 1937 until the election of Douglas Hyde in 1938, and during the vacancies of 1974, 1976, and 1997.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n!No.\n!Name<br />{{small|(birth\u2013death)}}\n!Portrait\n!Previous service\n! colspan=2|Term of office\n! colspan=2|Nominated by\n!Election\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1.\n|rowspan=2|[[Douglas Hyde]]<br />{{small|(1860\u20131949)}}\n|rowspan=2|[[File:Douglas Hyde - Project Gutenberg eText 19028.jpg|70px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] <br /> {{small|(1922\u201325, 1938)}}\n|rowspan=2|25 June 1938\n|rowspan=2|24 June 1945\n! style=\"background-color: {{Fianna F\u00e1il/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Fianna F\u00e1il]]\n|rowspan=2|[[1938 Irish presidential election|1938]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Fine Gael/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Fine Gael]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2.\n|rowspan=2|[[Se\u00e1n T.

The presidency is largely a [[figurehead|ceremonial office]], but the president does exercise certain limited powers with absolute discretion. The president acts as a representative of the Irish state and guardian of the constitution. The president's official residence is {{lang|ga|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]}} in [[Phoenix Park]], [[Dublin]]. The office was established by the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, the first president took office in 1938, and [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|became internationally recognised as head of state in 1949]] following the coming into force of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]].\n\nThe current president is [[Michael D. Higgins]], who was [[2011 Irish presidential election|first elected]] on 29 October 2011. His inauguration was held on 11 November 2011. He was [[2018 Irish presidential election|re-elected for a second term]] on 26 October 2018.\n\n==Ordinary duties and functions==\nThe [[Constitution of Ireland]] provides for a [[parliamentary system]] of government, under which the role of the [[head of state]] is largely a ceremonial one. The president is formally one of three parts of the [[Oireachtas]] (national parliament), which also comprises [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the house of representatives or [[lower house]]) and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] (the Senate or [[upper house]]).\n\nUnlike most [[parliamentary republic]]s, the president is not even the ''nominal'' chief executive. Rather, executive authority in Ireland is expressly vested in the [[Government of Ireland|government]] (cabinet). The government is obliged, however, to keep the president generally informed on matters of domestic and foreign policy. Most of the functions of the president may be carried out only in accordance with the strict instructions of the Constitution, or the binding \"[[advice (constitutional)|advice]]\" of the government. The president does, however, possess certain personal powers that may be exercised at his or her discretion.\n\n===Constitutional functions===\nThe main functions are prescribed by the Constitution:\n;Appoints the government:The president formally appoints the [[Taoiseach]] (head of government) and other ministers, and accepts their resignations. The Taoiseach is appointed upon the nomination of the D\u00e1il, and the president is required to appoint whomever the D\u00e1il designates without the right to decline appointment.  The remainder of the cabinet is appointed upon the nomination of the Taoiseach and approval of the D\u00e1il; as with appointing the Taoiseach, the president is required to make the appointment without the right to appoint someone else.  Ministers are dismissed on the advice of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach must, unless there is a dissolution of the D\u00e1il, resign upon [[motion of no confidence|losing the confidence]] of the house.\n;Appoints the judiciary: The president appoints the judges to all [[courts of the Republic of Ireland|courts in Ireland]], on the advice of the government.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Convenes and dissolves the D\u00e1il:This power is exercised on the advice of the Taoiseach; government or D\u00e1il approval is not needed. The president may only refuse a [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] when a Taoiseach has lost the confidence of the D\u00e1il.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Signs bills into law:The president cannot [[veto]] a [[bill (law)|bill]] that the D\u00e1il and the Seanad have adopted. However, he or she may refer it to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court upholds the bill, the president must sign it. If, however, it is found to be unconstitutional, the president will decline to give assent.<ref name=irlpres/>\n;Represents the state in foreign affairs:<ref name=irlpres/> This power is exercised only on the advice of the government. The president accredits ambassadors and receives the [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]] of foreign diplomats. Ministers sign international treaties in the president's name. This role was not exercised by the president prior to the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]\n;Supreme Commander of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]]:<ref>Constitution of Ireland: Article 13.4</ref> This role is somewhat similar in statute to that of a [[commander-in-chief]]. An [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]'s [[commission (document)|commission]] is signed and sealed by the president. This is a nominal position, the powers of which are exercised on the advice of the government. (See [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]].)\n;Power of pardon:The president, on the advice of the government, has \"the right of [[pardon]] and the power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or remit punishment\".<ref>Constitution of Ireland: Article 13.6</ref> Pardon, for [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]], has applied rarely: Thomas Quinn in 1940, Brady in 1943, and [[Nicky Kelly]] in 1992.<ref>[https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1993-11-30/20/ Criminal Procedure Bill, 1993: Report Stage] D\u00e1il debates, 30 November 1993</ref> The current procedure is specified by Section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0040/sec0007.html Petition for grant of pardon.] Criminal Procedure Act, 1993;

While earlier presidents were exceptionally cautious in delivering speeches and on almost every occasion submitted them for vetting, [[Mary Robinson]] and [[Mary McAleese]] made much more use of their right to speak without government approval, with McAleese doing many live television and radio interviews. Nonetheless, by convention presidents refrain from direct criticism of the government.\n\n==Discretionary powers==\n{{anchor|Discretionary powers|Discretionary power|Reserve powers|Reserve power}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\nThe president possesses the following powers exercised \"in his absolute discretion\" according to the English version of the Constitution.  The Irish version states that these powers are exercised ''as a chomhairle f\u00e9in'' which is usually translated as  \"under his own counsel.\"  Lawyers have suggested that a conflict may exist in this case between both versions of the constitution. In the event of a clash between the Irish and English versions of the constitution, the Irish one is given supremacy. While \"absolute discretion\" appears to leave some freedom for manoeuvre for a president in deciding whether to initiate contact with the opposition, \"own counsel\" has been interpreted by some lawyers as suggesting that ''no'' contact whatsoever can take place. As a result, it is considered controversial for the president to be contacted by the leaders of any political parties in an effort to influence a decision made using the discretionary powers. It is required that, before exercising certain reserve powers, the president consult the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]. However, the president is not compelled to act in accordance with the council's advice.\n\n===Refusal of a D\u00e1il dissolution===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\nThe [[Taoiseach]] is required to resign if he has \"ceased to retain the support of a majority in D\u00e1il Eireann,\" unless he asks the president to dissolve the D\u00e1il. The president has the right to refuse such a request, in which case the Taoiseach must resign immediately. This power has never been invoked.  However, the necessary circumstances existed in 1944, 1982 and 1994.  The apparent discrepancy, referred to above, between the Irish and English versions of the Constitution has discouraged presidents from contemplating the use of the power.  On the three occasions when the necessary circumstances existed, presidents have adopted an ultra-strict policy of non-contact with the opposition.  The most notable instance of this was in January 1982, when [[Patrick Hillery]] instructed an aide, Captain Anthony Barber, to ensure that no telephone calls from the opposition were to be passed on to him. Nevertheless, three opposition figures, including [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] leader [[Charles Haughey]], demanded to be connected to Hillery, with Haughey threatening to end Barber's career if the calls weren't put through. Hillery, as Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, recorded the threat in Barber's military personnel file and recorded that Barber had been acting on his instructions in refusing the call.<ref>Fergus Finlay, ''Snakes & Ladders'' (New Island Books, 1998). p.91.</ref> Even without this consideration, refusing such a request would arguably create a [[constitutional crisis]], as it is considered a fairly strong [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the head of state always grants a parliamentary dissolution.\n\n===Reference of bills to the people===\n{{main|ordinary referendum}}\nIf requested to do so by a petition signed by a majority of the membership of the Seanad, and one-third of the membership of the D\u00e1il, the president may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign into law a bill (other than a bill to amend the constitution) they consider to be of great \"national importance\" until it has been approved by either the people in a referendum or the D\u00e1il reassembling after a general election, held within eighteen months. This power has never been used, and no such petition has been invoked. Of the 60 senators, [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|11 are nominated by the Taoiseach]], so there is rarely a majority opposed to a government bill.\n\n===Other===\nThe president may appoint up to seven members of the Council of State, and remove or replace such appointed members. (See [[list of presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland)|list of presidential appointees to the Council of State]].) The following powers all require prior consultation with the Council of State, although the president need not take its advice:\n;Referral of bills to the Supreme Court: The president may refer a bill, in whole or part, to the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court finds any referred part unconstitutional, the entire bill falls. This power may not be applied to a [[money bill]], a bill to amend the Constitution, or an urgent bill the time for the consideration of which has been abridged in the Seanad. This is the most widely used reserve power;<ref name=\"meetingscouncilofstate\">[http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=18&lang=eng Meetings of the Council of State] Office of the President</ref> a full list is at [[Council of State (Ireland)#Referring of bills]].  In a 1982 judgment delivered under such a referral, [[Chief Justice of Ireland|Chief Justice]] [[Tom O'Higgins]] bemoaned the crude strictures of the prescribed process; especially the fact that, if the court finds that a bill does not violate the Constitution, this judgment can never subsequently be challenged.<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/%28WebFiles%29/7FC625DAD10A956C802575F3002D6B7E/$FILE/Housing_%5B1983%5D%20IR%20181.htm In the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the Matter of The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981] 1983 IRSC 185\u20137</ref>\n;Abridgement of the time for bills in the Seanad: The president may, at the request of the D\u00e1il, impose a time-limit on the period during which the Seanad may consider a bill. The effect of this power is to restrict the power of the Seanad to delay a bill that the government considers urgent.\n;Appointment of a Committee of Privileges: The president may, if requested to do so by the Seanad, establish a Committee of Privileges to solve a dispute between the two Houses of the Oireachtas as to whether or not a bill is a money bill.<ref>Constitution of Ireland: Article 22</ref>\n;Address to the Oireachtas: The president may address, or send a message to, either or both Houses of the Oireachtas.

Because a person's thirty-fifth year of life begins on their thirty-fourth birthday, this means there is a year's difference between the minimum ages as stated in the two texts.

Since the establishment of the office this has occurred on six occasions.\n\nThe [[2018 Irish presidential election|most recent presidential election]] was held on 26 October 2018.\n\n==Absence of a president==\n{{main|Presidential Commission (Ireland)}}\nThere is no office of [[vice president]] of Ireland. In the event of a premature vacancy a successor must be elected within sixty days. In a vacancy or where the president is unavailable, the duties and functions of the office are carried out by a presidential commission, consisting of the [[Chief Justice of Ireland|chief justice]], the [[Ceann Comhairle|ceann comhairle]] (speaker) of the D\u00e1il, and the [[cathaoirleach]] (chairperson) of the Seanad. Routine functions, such as signing bills into law, have often been fulfilled by the presidential commission when the president is abroad on a [[state visit]]. The government's power to prevent the president leaving the state is relevant in aligning the diplomatic and legislative calendars.\n\nTechnically each president's term of office expires at midnight on the day before the new president's inauguration.<ref name=\"article 12\">{{cite web|title=Constitution of Ireland|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_Constitution/|accessdate=13 May 2014|quote=Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland defines the exact duration of the president's term of office (date information italicised for the purpose of this footnote): ''''Article 12.3.1:''' The president shall hold office for seven years ''from the date upon which he enters upon his office'', unless before the expiration of that period he dies, or resigns, or is removed from office, or becomes permanently incapacitated, such incapacity being established to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court consisting of not less than five judges.' Also, ''''Article 12.7:''' The first president shall enter upon his office as soon as may be after his election, and every subsequent ''president shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor'' or as soon as may be thereafter or, in the event of his predecessor's removal from office, death, resignation, or permanent incapacity established as provided by section 3 hereof, as soon as may be after the election.'}}</ref> Therefore, between midnight and the inauguration the following day the presidential duties and functions are carried out by the presidential commission. The constitution also empowers the Council of State, acting by a majority of its members, to \"make such provision as to them may seem meet\" for the exercise of the duties of the president in any contingency the constitution does not foresee. However, to date, it has never been necessary for the council to take up this role. Though an outgoing president of Ireland who has been re-elected is usually described in the media as \"president\" before the taking of the Declaration of Office, that is actually incorrect. The Irish Constitution makes it clear that a president's term of office expires on the day before the inauguration of their successor.<ref name=\"article 12\"/> In the [[interregnum]] period, the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|presidential commission]] acts as president, though given that it is usually for less than 11 hours no presidential commission has ever been called on to do anything in that period. Technically for that period the outgoing president is a ''former'' president and, if re-elected, ''president-elect''.\n\nVacancies in the presidency have occurred three times: on the death of [[Erskine Hamilton Childers]] in 1974, and on the resignations of [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]] in 1976 and [[Mary Robinson]] in 1997.\n\n==Official residence, salute, style and address==\n[[File:\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in 2010.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] is the official residence of the president.]]\nThe official residence of the president is [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]], located in the [[Phoenix Park]] in Dublin. The ninety-two-room building formerly served as the 'out-of-season' residence of the Irish [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] and the residence of two of the three Irish [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governors-General]]: [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]] and [[James McNeill]]. The president is normally referred to as 'President' or 'Uachtar\u00e1n', rather than 'Mr/Madam President' or similar forms. The [[Style (manner of address)|style]] used is normally ''His Excellency/Her Excellency'' ({{lang-ga|A Shoilse/A Soilse}}); sometimes people may orally address the president as 'Your Excellency' ({{lang-ga|A Shoilse}} {{IPA-ga|\u0259 \u02c8h\u0259\u028e\u0283\u032a\u02b2\u0259|}}), or simply 'President' ({{lang-ga|A Uachtar\u00e1in}} {{IPA|[\u0259 \u02c8u\u02d0\u0259xt\u032a\u02e0\u0259\u027ea\u02d0n\u0325]}} ([[vocative case]])). The [[Presidential Salute]] is taken from the National Anthem, \"[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann]]\". It consists of the first four bars followed by the last five,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taoiseach.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_National_Anthem/|title=National Anthem |publisher=[[Department of the Taoiseach]]|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> without lyrics.\n\n==Inauguration==\n{{primary sources|date=March 2020}}\nThe inauguration ceremony takes place on the day following the expiry of the term of office of the preceding president.<ref>Irish Constitution, Article 12.7</ref> No location is specified in the constitution, but all inaugurations have taken place in [[Dublin Castle#State Apartments|Saint Patrick's Hall]] in the State Apartments in [[Dublin Castle]]. The ceremony is transmitted live by national broadcaster [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] on its principal television and radio channels, typically from around 11 am. To highlight the significance of the event, all key figures in the executive (the [[government of Ireland]]), the legislature (Oireachtas) and the judiciary attend, as do members of the [[diplomatic corps]] and other invited guests.\n\nDuring the period of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922 to 1937), the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general]] had been installed into office as the representative of [[the Crown]] in a low-key ceremony, twice in [[Leinster House]] (the seat of the [[Oireachtas]]), but in the case of the last governor-general, [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], in his brother's [[drawing room]]. By contrast, the [[Constitution of Ireland]] adopted in 1937 requires the president's oath of office be taken in public.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nUnder the Constitution, in assuming office the president must subscribe to a formal declaration, made publicly and in the presence of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, judges of the Supreme Court and the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]], and other \"public personages\".<ref name=\"coiart12-8\">Constitution of Ireland: Article 12.8</ref> The inauguration of the president takes place in St Patrick's Hall in [[Dublin Castle]]. The declaration is specified in Article 12.8:\n\n:{{lang|ga|I l\u00e1thair Dia na nUilechumhacht, t\u00e1imse, [ainm], \u00e1 ghealladh agus \u00e1 dhearbh\u00fa go soll\u00fanta is go f\u00edrinneach bheith i mo thaca agus i mo dh\u00eddin do Bhunreacht \u00c9ireann, agus a dl\u00edthe a chaomhn\u00fa, mo dhualgais a chomhl\u00edonadh go d\u00edlis coinsiasach de r\u00e9ir an Bhunreachta is an dl\u00ed, agus mo l\u00e1nd\u00edcheall a dh\u00e9anamh ar son leasa is f\u00f3naimh mhuintir na h\u00c9ireann. Dia do mo sti\u00faradh agus do mo chumhdach.}}<ref name=\"coiart12-8\"/>\n\n:In the presence of Almighty God, I, [name], do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws, that I will fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and that I will dedicate my abilities to the service and the welfare of the people of Ireland. May God direct and sustain me.<ref name=\"coiart12-8\"/>\n\nTo date every president has subscribed to the declaration in Irish. [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], who never learnt Irish and spoke with a distinctive [[Oxbridge]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] that made pronouncing Irish quite difficult, opted with some reluctance for the Irish version in 1973. Pictures of the event show Childers reading from an exceptionally large board where it had been written down phonetically for him. At his second inauguration in 2018, [[Michael D. Higgins]] first made the declaration in Irish, then repeated it in English.\n\nIn 1993 the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] expressed concern that, because of its religious language, the declaration amounts to a religious test for office. The Oireachtas Committee in 1998 recommended that the religious references be made optional.\n\n===Presidential address===\nHaving taken the Declaration of Office, the new president traditionally delivers an address to the guests. Constitutionally all addresses or messages to 'the Nation' or to 'the Oireachtas' are supposed to have prior government approval. Some lawyers have questioned whether the speech at the inauguration should fall into the category requiring government approval. However, as it is impractical to get approval given that the new president is only president for a matter of moments before delivering the speech and so has not had a time to submit it, any constitutional questions as to its status are ignored.\n\n===Religious and humanist involvement===\nInauguration Day involves a lot of ritual and ceremonial. Until 1983 the morning saw the president-elect, accompanied by his spouse, escorted by the Presidential Motorcycle Escort to one of Dublin's cathedrals. If they were [[Catholic]] they were brought to [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] for a [[Pontifical High Mass]]. If they were [[Church of Ireland]], they were brought to [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] for a Divine Service. In the 1970s instead of separate denominational ceremonies a single ecumenical multi-faith service was held in the cathedral of the faith of the president-elect. Some additional religious ceremonies also featured: President-elect [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]] attended a prayer ceremony in a synagogue in Dublin to reflect his longstanding relationship with the [[Jew]]ish Community in Ireland.\n\n[[File:St. Patrick\u2019s Hall Dublin Castle 2014.JPG|thumb|Saint Patrick's Hall, where presidents are inaugurated.]]\nIn 1983, to reduce the costs of the day in a period of economic retrenchment, the separate religious blessing ceremony was incorporated into the inauguration ceremony itself, with the president-elect blessed by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, Methodism, the Society of Friends, and the Jewish and Islamic faiths. This inter-faith service has featured in the inaugurations since 1983. Since 2011, a representative from the [[Humanist Association of Ireland]], representing [[secular humanism|humanism]] and the non-religious population of Ireland, has appeared alongside ministers of a religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2744/irelands-humanist-president|last=Reidy|first=Padraig|work=[[New Humanist]]|title=Ireland's humanist president|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dress codes===\nFor the first inauguration in 1938 President-elect [[Douglas Hyde]] wore a [[morning suit]], with black silk [[top hat]]. Morning suits continued to be a standard feature of Irish presidential inaugurations until 1997 when [[Mary McAleese]], whose husband disliked wearing formal suits, abolished their use for inaugurations (and for all other presidential ceremonial). From then, guests were required to wear plain [[business suit]]s, and judges were prohibited from wearing their distinctive wigs and gowns. Ambassadors were also discouraged from wearing national dress.\n\n===End of the day===\nThe president-elect (unless they are already a serving president, in which case they will already be living in the presidential residence) are usually driven to the inauguration from their private home. After the ceremony they are driven through the streets of Dublin to [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]], the official presidential residence, where they are welcomed by the [[Secretary-General to the President|secretary-general to the president]], the head of the presidential secretariat.\n\nThat evening, the Irish government hosts a reception in their honour in the [[Dublin Castle#State apartments|State Apartments]] (the former Royal Apartments) in [[Dublin Castle]]. Whereas the dress code was formerly [[white tie]] affair, it is now more usually [[black tie]].\n\n==Impeachment and removal from office==\nThe president can be removed from office in two ways, neither of which has ever been invoked. The Supreme Court, in a sitting of at least five judges, may find the president \"permanently incapacitated\",<ref name=\"coiart12-3\"/> while the Oireachtas may remove the president for \"stated misbehaviour\".<ref name=\"coiart12-10\">Constitution of Ireland: Article 12.10</ref> Either house of the Oireachtas may instigate the latter process by passing an [[impeachment]] resolution, provided at least thirty members move it and at least two-thirds support it. The other house will then either investigate the stated charges or commission a body to do so; following which at least two-thirds of members must agree both that the president is guilty and that the charges warrant removal.<ref name=\"coiart12-10\"/>\n\n==Security and transport==\n[[File:Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly being escorted to his inauguration as President of Ireland in 1945.jpg|thumb|The Inauguration of Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly in 1945. The 2nd Cavalry Squadron of the [[Blue Hussars]] escort the president, who travelled in the late [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]'s landau. The Landau and the Hussars were later scrapped.]]\nAs head of state of Ireland, the president receives the highest level of protection in the state. \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in is protected by armed guards from the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] and [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] at all times, and is encircled by security fencing and intrusion detection systems. At all times the president travels with an armed security detail in Ireland and overseas, which is provided by the [[Special Detective Unit]] (SDU), an elite wing of the Irish police force. Protection is increased if there is a known threat. The presidential limousine is a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] LWB. The Presidential Limousine is dark navy blue and carries the presidential standard on the left front wing and the [[Flag of Ireland|tricolour]] on the right front wing. When travelling the presidential limousine is always accompanied by support cars (normally [[BMW 5 Series]], [[Audi A6]] and [[Volvo S60]] driven by trained drivers from the SDU) and several Garda motorcycle outriders from the [[Garda Traffic Corps]] which form a protective convoy around the car.\n\nThe president-elect is usually escorted to and from the ceremony by the Presidential Motorcycle Escort ceremonial outriders. Until 1947 they were a [[cavalry]] mounted escort, wearing light blue hussar-style uniforms. However to save money the first Inter-Party Government replaced the Irish horses by Japanese motorbikes, which the then Minister for Defence believed would be \"much more impressive.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAt the presidential inauguration in 1945, alongside the mounted escort on horseback, president-elect [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] rode in the old state landau of Queen [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra the Queen Mother]]. The use of the state carriage was highly popular with crowds. However an accident with a later presidential carriage at the [[Royal Dublin Society]] [[Horse show]] led to the abolition of the carriage and its replacement by a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith]] in 1947. The distinctive [[Presidential State Car (Ireland)|1947 Rolls-Royce]] is still used to bring the president to and from the inauguration today.\n\nThe [[Presidential State Car (Ireland)|Presidential State Car]] is a 1947 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith]] [[Landaulet (car)|landaulet]]te, which is used only for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe president also has the full use of all [[Air Corps (Ireland)|Irish Air Corps]] aircraft at his/her disposal if so needed, including helicopters and private jets.\n\n==History==\nThe office of president was established in 1937, in part as a replacement for the office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general]] that existed during the 1922\u201337 [[Irish Free State]]. The seven-year term of office of the president was inspired by that of the [[president of Germany (1919\u20131945)|presidents of Weimar Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} At the time the office was established critics warned that the post might lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. However, these fears were not borne out as successive presidents played a limited, largely apolitical role in national affairs.\n\n===Head of state from 1937 to 1949===\n{{Main|Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949}}\n{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2019}}\nDuring the period of 1937 to 1949 it was unclear whether the Irish head of state was actually the president of Ireland or [[George VI]], the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|king of Ireland]]. This period of confusion ended in 1949 when the state was declared to be a [[republic]]. The 1937 constitution did not mention the king, but neither did it state that the president was head of state, saying rather that the president \"shall take precedence over all other persons in the State\". The president exercised some powers that could be exercised by heads of state but which could also be exercised by governors or governors-general, such as appointing the government and promulgating the law.\n\nHowever, in 1936, George VI had been declared \"King of Ireland\" and, under the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]] of the same year, it was this king who represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, therefore, were signed in the name of the King of Ireland, who also accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Irish head of state in the eyes of foreign nations. The [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], which came into force in April 1949, proclaimed a republic and transferred the role of representing the state abroad from the monarch to the president. No change was made to the constitution.\n\n===Evolving role===\nAfter the inaugural presidency of [[Douglas Hyde]], who was an interparty nominee for the office, the nominees of the [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] political party won every presidential election until 1990. The party traditionally used the nomination as a reward for its most senior and prominent members, such as party founder and longtime Taoiseach [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] and [[European Commissioner]] [[Patrick Hillery]]. Most of its occupants to that time followed Hyde's precedent-setting conception of the presidency as a conservative, low-key institution that used its ceremonial prestige and few discretionary powers sparingly. In fact, the presidency was such a quiet position that Irish politicians sought to avoid contested presidential elections as often as possible, feeling that the attention such elections would bring to the office was an unnecessary distraction,<ref name=uachtarainmcaleese>{{cite video |people=Diarmaid Ferriter |date=2007 |title=Uachtar\u00e1in \u2013 Mary McAleese |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121637/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |medium=Television production |language=Irish |publisher=TG4 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=5 January 2011 }}</ref> and office-seekers facing economic austerity would often suggest the elimination of the office as a money-saving measure.<ref name=uachtarainrobinson>{{cite video |people=Diarmaid Ferriter |date=2007 |title=Uachtar\u00e1in \u2013 Mary Robinson |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121637/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1826707783014013023 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |medium=Television production |language=Irish |publisher=TG4 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=5 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the historical meekness of the presidency, however, it has been at the centre of some high-profile controversies. In particular, the fifth president, [[Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]], faced a contentious dispute with the government in 1976 over the signing of a bill declaring a state of emergency, which ended in \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh's resignation. His successor, Patrick Hillery, was also involved in a controversy in 1982, when then-Taoiseach [[Garret FitzGerald]] requested a dissolution of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. Hillery was bombarded with phone calls from opposition members urging him to refuse the request, an action that Hillery saw as highly inappropriate interference with the president's constitutional role and resisted the political pressure.\n\nThe presidency began to be transformed in the 1990s. Hillery's conduct regarding the dissolution affair in 1982 came to light in 1990, imbuing the office with a new sense of dignity and stability. However, it was Hillery's successor, seventh president [[Mary Robinson]], who ultimately revolutionized the presidency. The winner of an upset victory in the highly controversial election of 1990, Robinson was the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] nominee, the first president to defeat Fianna F\u00e1il in an election and the first female president. Upon election, however, Robinson took steps to de-politicize the office. She also sought to widen the scope of the presidency, developing new economic, political and cultural links between the state and other countries and cultures, especially those of the [[Irish diaspora]]. Robinson used the prestige of the office to activist ends, placing emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the [[Great Irish Famine]] to today's nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries.<ref name=uachtarainrobinson />\n\n===Remuneration and expenses===\nAfter the [[2018 Irish presidential election|2018 presidential election]] the official salary or \"personal remuneration\" of the president will be [[Euro|\u20ac]]249,014.<ref name=\"higgins2011salary\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.president.ie/en/media-library/news-releases/statement-from-president-michael-d.-higgins-regarding-voluntary-salary-redu|title=Statement from President Michael D.

Presidents have attended the ceremony since the 1990s.]]\nThe text of the Constitution of Ireland, as originally enacted in 1937, made reference in its [[Articles 2 and 3]] to two geopolitical entities: a thirty-two county 'national territory' (i.e., the island of [[Ireland]]), and a twenty-six county 'state' formerly known as the [[Irish Free State]]. The implication behind the title 'president of Ireland' was that the president would function as the head of all Ireland. However, this implication was challenged by the [[Ulster Unionists]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] which was the state internationally acknowledged as having jurisdiction over [[Northern Ireland]]. Articles 2 and 3 were substantially amended in consequence of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\nIreland in turn challenged the proclamation in the United Kingdom of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1952 as '[Queen] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. The Irish government refused to attend royal functions as a result; for example, [[Patrick Hillery]] declined on government advice to attend the wedding of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] to [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981, to which he had been invited by Queen Elizabeth, just as [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] had declined on government advice to attend the 1953 Coronation Garden Party at the British Embassy in Dublin. Britain in turn insisted on referring to the president as 'president of the Republic of Ireland' or 'president of the Irish Republic'.<ref group=\"n\">The office of \"[[President of the Irish Republic]]\" existed in the separatist [[Irish Republic]] of 1919\u201321.</ref> Letters of Credence from Queen Elizabeth, on the [[British government]]'s advice, appointing United Kingdom ambassadors to Ireland were not addressed to the 'president of Ireland' but to the president personally (for example: 'President Hillery').\n\nThe naming dispute and consequent avoidance of contact at head of state level has gradually thawed since 1990.  President Robinson (1990\u201397) chose unilaterally to break the taboo by regularly visiting the United Kingdom for public functions, frequently in connection with [[Anglo-Irish Relations]] or to visit the Irish emigrant community in Great Britain. In another breaking of precedent, she accepted an invitation to [[Buckingham Palace]] by Queen Elizabeth II. Palace accreditation supplied to journalists referred to the \"visit of the president of Ireland\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Between 1990 and 2010, both Robinson and her successor President McAleese (1997\u20132011) visited the Palace on numerous occasions, while senior members of the British royal family \u2013 the Prince of Wales, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|the Duke of York]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|the Earl of Wessex]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] \u2013 all visited both presidents of Ireland at [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]. The presidents also attended functions with [[Anne, Princess Royal|the Princess Royal]]. President Robinson jointly hosted a reception with the queen at [[St. James's Palace]], London, in 1995, to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Queen's Colleges in 1845 (the Queen's Colleges are now known as [[the Queen's University of Belfast]], [[University College, Cork]], and [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]).  These contacts eventually led to [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|a state visit]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] to Ireland in 2011.\n\nThough the president's title implicitly asserted authority in Northern Ireland, in reality the Irish president needed government permission to visit there. (The Constitution of Ireland in Article 3 explicitly stated that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\" the authority of the Irish state did not extend to Northern Ireland. Presidents prior to the presidency of Mary Robinson were regularly refused permission by the Irish government to visit Northern Ireland.)\n\nHowever, since the 1990s and in particular since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998, the president has regularly visited Northern Ireland. President McAleese, who was the first president to have been born in Northern Ireland, continued on from President Robinson in this regard. In a sign of the warmth of modern British-Irish relations, she has even been warmly welcomed by most leading [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]]. At the funeral for a child murdered by the [[Real IRA]] in [[Omagh]] she symbolically walked up the main aisle of the [[church (building)|church]] hand-in-hand with the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] leader and then [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[David Trimble]]. But in other instances, Mary McAleese had been criticised for certain comments, such as a reference to the way in which Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been brought up to hate Catholics just as German children had been encouraged to hate [[Jews]] under the [[Nazi]] regime, on 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4214263.stm | work=BBC News | title=McAleese row over Nazi comments | date=28 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2005/01/27/story186673.html BreakingNews.ie: Archives :2005-01-27]</ref> These remarks caused outrage among Northern Ireland's unionist politicians, and McAleese later apologised<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4217545.stm | work=BBC News | title=McAleese 'sorry' over Nazi remark | date=29 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> and conceded that her statement had been unbalanced.\n\n===Suggestions for reform===\nThere have been many suggestions for reforming the office of president over the years. In 1996, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of President should remain largely unchanged. However, it suggested that the Constitution should be amended to explicitly declare the president to be head of state (at present that term does not appear in the text), and that consideration be given to the introduction of a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] system in the D\u00e1il, along the lines of that in Germany. If this system were introduced then the power of the president to refuse a D\u00e1il dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away. The All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's 1998 Report made similar recommendations.\n\nIn an October 2009 poll, concerning support for various potential candidates in the [[2011 Irish presidential election|2011 presidential election]] conducted by the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', a \"significant number\" of people were said to feel that the presidency is a waste of money and should be abolished.<ref name=SI_200091011>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/womans-place-is-still-in-the-aras-poll-26572771.html |title=Woman's place is still in the Aras \u2013 poll |last=Reilly |first=Jerome |date=11 October 2009 |work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]] |accessdate=31 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==List of presidents of Ireland==\nThe functions of the president were exercised by the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|Presidential Commission]] from the coming into force of the Constitution on 29 December 1937 until the election of Douglas Hyde in 1938, and during the vacancies of 1974, 1976, and 1997.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n!No.\n!Name<br />{{small|(birth\u2013death)}}\n!Portrait\n!Previous service\n! colspan=2|Term of office\n! colspan=2|Nominated by\n!Election\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1.\n|rowspan=2|[[Douglas Hyde]]<br />{{small|(1860\u20131949)}}\n|rowspan=2|[[File:Douglas Hyde - Project Gutenberg eText 19028.jpg|70px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] <br /> {{small|(1922\u201325, 1938)}}\n|rowspan=2|25 June 1938\n|rowspan=2|24 June 1945\n! style=\"background-color: {{Fianna F\u00e1il/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Fianna F\u00e1il]]\n|rowspan=2|[[1938 Irish presidential election|1938]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Fine Gael/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Fine Gael]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2.\n|rowspan=2|[[Se\u00e1n T.

Shangdu then became his [[summer capital]]. It is located in the present-day [[Zhenglan Banner]], in [[Inner Mongolia]], China.\n\nShangdu (Xanadu) was visited by the [[Venice|Venetian]] traveller [[Marco Polo]] in about 1275 and was destroyed in 1369 by the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army under [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]]. In 1797 historical accounts of the city inspired the famous poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' by the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\n== Description ==\nShangdu was located in what is now Shangdu Town, Zhenglan Banner, [[Inner Mongolia]], {{convert|350|km|mi}} north of Beijing. It is about {{convert|28|km|mi}} northwest of the modern town of [[Dolon Nor|Duolun]]. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2,200&nbsp;m; it consists of an \"outer city\", and an \"inner city\" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1,400&nbsp;m, and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550&nbsp;m, covering an area of around 40% the size of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.\n\nThe city, originally named '''Kaiping''' ({{linktext|\u5f00\u5e73}}, ''K\u0101ip\u00edng''), was designed by Chinese architect [[Liu Bingzhong]] from 1252 to 1256,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/timeperiod_china.jsp?ctry=China&pd=Yuan|title=Yuan dynasty|publisher=[[Princeton University Art Museum]]}}</ref> and Liu implemented a \"profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese imperial city planning|author=Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1999|page=153|isbn=0-8248-2196-3|quote=Liu Bingzhong implemented a preconceived and profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture.}}</ref> In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the [[Ming dynasty|Ming army]], put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping. The last reigning Khan, [[Toghun Tem\u00fcr]], fled the city, which was abandoned for several hundred years.<ref name=\"man\">{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Kublai Khan: From Xanadu to Superpower|year=2006|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|location=London|isbn=9780553817188|pages=104\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Steven Bushell, affiliated with the British Legation in Beijing, visited the site and reported that remains of temples, blocks of marble, and tiles were still to be found there.

In about 1298\u201399, he dictated the following account, one of the most complete descriptions of the city as it existed:\n{{quote|And when you have ridden three days from the city last mentioned, [[Points_of_the_compass|between north-east and north]], you come to a city called Chandu, which was built by the Khan now reigning. There is at this place a very fine marble palace, the rooms of which are all [[Gilding|gilt]] and painted with figures of men and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and flowers, all executed with such exquisite art that you regard them with delight and astonishment.\n\nRound this Palace a wall is built, [[wiktionary:inclose|inclosing]] a [[wiktionary:encompass|compass]] of 16 miles, and\ninside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and beautiful\nmeadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of\nferocious nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed there to\nsupply food for his [[Gyrfalcon|gerfalcons]] and hawks, which he keeps there in mew.<ref>{{cite wikisource |editor-first=Hugh |editor-last=Chisholm |chapter=Mew |wslink=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |plaintitle=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition=Eleventh |year=1911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |quote='''MEW'''.

The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in\nmew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a leopard behind him on\nhis horse's [[Rump_(animal)|croup]]; and then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he\nslips his leopard at it, and the game when taken is made over to\nfeed the hawks in mew. This he does for [[Sport#Etymology|diversion]].\n\nMoreover at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood he has\nanother Palace built of [[Wicker|cane]], of which I must give you a description. It\nis gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. It is [[wiktionary:stay#Etymology_2|stayed]] on\ngilt and [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail\nof which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the\n[[architrave]], and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to\nsupport the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes,\ncovered with a [[Varnish|varnish]] so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will\nrot them. These canes are a good 3 [[Palm_(unit)|palms]] in girth, and from 10 to 15 [[Pace_(unit)|paces]]\nin length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are\nsplit so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house\nis roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent\nthe wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these\ncanes, which I may mention serve also for a great variety of other\nuseful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can\nbe taken down and put up again with great [[wiktionary:celerity|celerity]]; and it can all be\ntaken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When\nerected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200\ncords of silk.\n\nThe Khan abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble\nPalace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to\nwit, June, July and August; preferring this residence because it is by no\nmeans hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon\nof] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to\npieces. But I must tell you what happens when he goes away from\nthis Palace every year on the 28th of the August [Moon]..\" <ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_61 The Travels of Marco Polo, Book 1/Chapter 61, ''Of the City of Chandu, and the Kaan's Palace There''. from Wikisource, translated by Henry Yule</ref>\n}}\n\n==Description by Toghon Temur (1368)==\n\nThe lament of [[Toghon Tem\u00fcr|Toghon Temur Khan]] (the \"Ukhaant Khan\" or \"Sage Khan\"), concerning the loss of Daidu (Beijing) and Heibun Shanduu (Kaiping Xanadu) in 1368, is recorded in many Mongolian historical chronicles.

The dream caused him to begin the poem known as '[[Kubla Khan]]'.  Unfortunately Coleridge's writing was interrupted by an unnamed \"[[Person from Porlock|person on business from Porlock]]\", causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.\n\nColeridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, ''Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep'', published in 1816:\n <blockquote>\"In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's Pilgrimes':\n\nHere the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto.

It is about {{convert|28|km|mi}} northwest of the modern town of [[Dolon Nor|Duolun]]. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2,200&nbsp;m; it consists of an \"outer city\", and an \"inner city\" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1,400&nbsp;m, and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550&nbsp;m, covering an area of around 40% the size of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.\n\nThe city, originally named '''Kaiping''' ({{linktext|\u5f00\u5e73}}, ''K\u0101ip\u00edng''), was designed by Chinese architect [[Liu Bingzhong]] from 1252 to 1256,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/timeperiod_china.jsp?ctry=China&pd=Yuan|title=Yuan dynasty|publisher=[[Princeton University Art Museum]]}}</ref> and Liu implemented a \"profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese imperial city planning|author=Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1999|page=153|isbn=0-8248-2196-3|quote=Liu Bingzhong implemented a preconceived and profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture.}}</ref> In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the [[Ming dynasty|Ming army]], put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping.

This he does for [[Sport#Etymology|diversion]].\n\nMoreover at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood he has\nanother Palace built of [[Wicker|cane]], of which I must give you a description. It\nis gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. It is [[wiktionary:stay#Etymology_2|stayed]] on\ngilt and [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail\nof which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the\n[[architrave]], and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to\nsupport the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes,\ncovered with a [[Varnish|varnish]] so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will\nrot them. These canes are a good 3 [[Palm_(unit)|palms]] in girth, and from 10 to 15 [[Pace_(unit)|paces]]\nin length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are\nsplit so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house\nis roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent\nthe wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these\ncanes, which I may mention serve also for a great variety of other\nuseful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can\nbe taken down and put up again with great [[wiktionary:celerity|celerity]]; and it can all be\ntaken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When\nerected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200\ncords of silk.\n\nThe Khan abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble\nPalace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to\nwit, June, July and August; preferring this residence because it is by no\nmeans hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon\nof] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to\npieces.

The dream caused him to begin the poem known as '[[Kubla Khan]]'.  Unfortunately Coleridge's writing was interrupted by an unnamed \"[[Person from Porlock|person on business from Porlock]]\", causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.\n\nColeridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, ''Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep'', published in 1816:\n <blockquote>\"In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's Pilgrimes':\n\nHere the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto.

The school accommodated over 800 students and operated for 30 years until 1994.\n\nConcurrently, the Pretoria school of Art, music and ballet was operating on the grounds of [[Pretoria Boys High School]] which is now the Pollock campus of Boys High. The arrangement was temporary as it seems that the state was planning on financing the construction of a new art school in Pretoria with its own grounds and facilities.\n\nBy the 1980s, the state of South Africa had great economic pressures due to the political context of the time and as a result, there was a shortage of funds that could be utilized to construct a new arts school from fresh. A decision was taken by the Transvaal department of education to move the art school from Pollock campus to the grounds of the commercial school in Alphen Park.

It is the lowest energy state (the [[ground state]]) of the electromagnetic field when the [[Quantization of the electromagnetic field|fields are quantized]].<ref name=Cao/> When [[Planck's constant]] is hypothetically allowed to approach zero, QED vacuum is converted to [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|classical vacuum]], which is to say, the vacuum of classical electromagnetism.<ref name=Mackay/><ref name=classical/>\n\nAnother field-theoretic vacuum is the [[QCD vacuum]] of the [[Standard Model]].\n[[File:Photon-photon scattering.svg|thumb|A [[Feynman diagram]] (''box diagram'') for photon-photon scattering, one photon scatters from the transient [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum charge fluctuation]]s of the other]]\n\n==Fluctuations==\n{{Main|Quantum fluctuation}}\n\n[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|right|150px| The video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]]. ]]\n\nThe QED vacuum is subject to fluctuations about a dormant zero average-field condition:<ref name=Shankar/> Here is a description of the quantum vacuum:\n{{quote|The quantum theory asserts that a vacuum, even the most perfect vacuum devoid of any matter, is not really empty. Rather the quantum vacuum can be depicted as a sea of continuously appearing and disappearing [pairs of] particles that manifest themselves in the apparent jostling of particles that is quite distinct from their thermal motions. These particles are \u2018virtual\u2019, as opposed to real, particles. ...At any given instant, the vacuum is full of such virtual pairs, which leave their signature behind, by affecting the energy levels of atoms.|Joseph Silk ''On the Shores of the Unknown'', p. 62<ref name= Silk/>}}\n\n===Virtual particles=== \n{{Main|Virtual particles|Quantum fluctuation}}\nIt is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles based upon the Heisenberg [[Uncertainty principle#Energy.E2.80.93time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]]:\n:<math>\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\, , </math>\n(where {{math|\u0394''E''}} and {{math|\u0394''t''}} are [[energy]] and [[time]] variations, and {{mvar|\u0127}} the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2{{pi}}) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the \"borrowing\" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times.<ref name=Davies/>\n\nThis interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universally accepted, however.<ref name=Allday/><ref name=King/> One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty {{math|\u0394''t''}} determines a \"budget\" for borrowing energy {{math|\u0394''E''}}.  Another issue is the meaning of \"time\" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position {{mvar|q}} and momentum {{mvar|p}}, for example) do not satisfy a [[canonical commutation relation]] (such as {{math|[''q'', ''p''] {{=}} ''i\u0127''}}).<ref name=commutation/> Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy.<ref name=Busch0/><ref name=Busch/> The many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a continuing subject of study.<ref name=Busch/>\n\n===Quantization of the fields===\n{{Main|Quantization of the electromagnetic field}}\nThe [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] does not allow a particle to exist in a state in which the particle is simultaneously at a fixed location, say the origin of coordinates, and has also zero momentum. Instead the particle has a range of momentum and spread in location attributable to quantum fluctuations; if confined, it has a [[zero-point energy]].<ref name=Schwabl/>\n\nAn uncertainty principle applies to all quantum mechanical operators that do not [[commutator|commute]].<ref name=Petrosyan/> In particular, it applies also to the electromagnetic field. A digression follows to flesh out the role of commutators for the electromagnetic field.<ref name=Vogel2/>\n:The standard approach to the quantization of the electromagnetic field begins by introducing a ''vector'' potential {{math|'''A'''}} and a ''scalar'' potential {{mvar|V}} to represent the basic electromagnetic electric field {{math|'''E'''}} and magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} using the relations:<ref name=Vogel2/>\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\\mathbf B &= \\mathbf {\\nabla  \\times A}\\,, \\\\ \n\\mathbf E &= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{\\nabla}V \\, . \n\\end{align}</math>\n:The vector potential is not completely determined by these relations, leaving open a so-called ''gauge freedom''. Resolving this ambiguity using the [[Coulomb gauge]] leads to a description of the electromagnetic fields in the absence of charges in terms of the vector potential and the ''momentum field'' {{math|'''\u03a0'''}}, given by:\n::<math> \\mathbf \\Pi = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{ \\partial }{\\partial t} \\mathbf A \\, , </math>\n:where {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[electric constant]] of the [[SI units]]. Quantization is achieved by insisting that the momentum field and the vector potential do not commute. That is, the equal-time commutator is:<ref name=Compagno/>\n::<math>\\bigl[\\Pi_i(\\mathbf{r}, t),\\ A_j(\\mathbf{r}', t)\\bigr]=-i\\hbar \\delta_{ij}\\delta (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\, , </math>\n:where {{math|'''r'''}}, {{math|'''r'''\u2032}} are spatial locations, {{mvar|\u0127}} is [[Planck's constant]] over 2{{pi}}, {{mvar|\u03b4<sub>ij</sub>}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] and {{math|''\u03b4''('''r''' \u2212 '''r'''\u2032)}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The notation {{math|[ , ]}} denotes the [[commutator]].\n\n:Quantization can be achieved without introducing the vector potential, in terms of the underlying fields themselves:<ref name=Vogel/>\n::<math>\\left[ \\hat{ E}_k (\\boldsymbol r ) , \\hat{ B}_{k'} (\\boldsymbol r') \\right] = -\\epsilon_{kk'm}\\frac{i \\hbar}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_m}  \\delta (\\boldsymbol{r-r'})  \\, , </math>\n:where the [[circumflex]] denotes a Schr\u00f6dinger time-independent field operator, and {{mvar|\u03b5<sub>ijk</sub>}} is the antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita tensor]].\n\nBecause of the non-commutation of field variables, the variances of the fields cannot be zero, although their averages are zero.<ref name=Grynberg/> The electromagnetic field has therefore a zero-point energy, and a lowest quantum state. The interaction of an excited atom with this lowest quantum state of the electromagnetic field is what leads to [[spontaneous emission]], the transition of an excited atom to a state of lower energy by emission of a [[photon]] even when no external perturbation of the atom is present.<ref name=Parker/>\n\n==Electromagnetic properties==\n{{See also|Lamb shift|Casimir effect|Spontaneous emission}}\n[[File:The polarisation of light emitted by a neutron star.jpg|thumb|The polarization of the observed light in the extremely strong magnetic field suggests that the empty space around the neutron star is subject to the vacuum birefringence.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Signs of Weird Quantum Property of Empty Space? \u2013 VLT observations of neutron star may confirm 80-year-old prediction about the vacuum|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1641/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nAs a result of quantization, the quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be considered as a material medium.<ref name=medium/> It is capable of [[vacuum polarization]].<ref name=Weisskopf/><ref name=Zeidler/> In particular, the [[Coulomb's law|force law between charged particles]] is affected.<ref name=Schroeder/><ref name=Schweber/> The electrical permittivity of quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be calculated, and it differs slightly from the simple {{math|[[electric constant|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]]}} of the [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|classical vacuum]].

Another reason that perfect vacuum is impossible is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that no particles can ever have an exact position ...Each atom exists as a probability function of space, which has a certain nonzero value everywhere in a given volume. ...More fundamentally, quantum mechanics predicts ...a correction to the energy called the zero-point energy [that] consists of energies of virtual particles that have a brief existence.

Predictions of QED vacuum such as [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Lamb shift]] have been experimentally verified, suggesting QED vacuum is a good model for a high quality realizable vacuum. There are competing theoretical models for vacuum, however. For example, [[QCD vacuum|quantum chromodynamic vacuum]] includes many virtual particles not treated in quantum electrodynamics. The vacuum of [[quantum gravity]] treats gravitational effects not included in the Standard Model.<ref name=gravity/> It remains an open question whether further refinements in experimental technique ultimately will support another model for realizable vacuum.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Compagno>\nThis commutation relation is oversimplified, and a correct version replaces the {{mvar|\u03b4}} product on the right by the transverse {{mvar|\u03b4}}-''tensor'':\n:<math>\\delta_{\\perp\\ ij}(\\mathbf x ) = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^3}\\int d^3 \\mathbf{k} \\left(\\delta_{ij}-\\hat{u}_i\\hat{u}_j \\right) e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}} \\ , </math>\nwhere {{math|'''\u00fb'''}} is the unit vector of {{math|'''k'''}}, {{math|'''\u00fb''' {{=}} {{sfrac|'''k'''|''k''}}}}.

Another reason that perfect vacuum is impossible is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that no particles can ever have an exact position ...Each atom exists as a probability function of space, which has a certain nonzero value everywhere in a given volume. ...More fundamentally, quantum mechanics predicts ...a correction to the energy called the zero-point energy [that] consists of energies of virtual particles that have a brief existence. This is called ''vacuum fluctuation''.|Luciano Boi, \"Creating the physical world ''ex nihilo''?\" p. 55<ref name=Longo/>}}\n\nVirtual particles make a ''perfect'' vacuum unrealizable, but leave open the question of attainability of a ''quantum electrodynamic vacuum'' or QED vacuum. Predictions of QED vacuum such as [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Lamb shift]] have been experimentally verified, suggesting QED vacuum is a good model for a high quality realizable vacuum. There are competing theoretical models for vacuum, however. For example, [[QCD vacuum|quantum chromodynamic vacuum]] includes many virtual particles not treated in quantum electrodynamics. The vacuum of [[quantum gravity]] treats gravitational effects not included in the Standard Model.<ref name=gravity/> It remains an open question whether further refinements in experimental technique ultimately will support another model for realizable vacuum.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Compagno>\nThis commutation relation is oversimplified, and a correct version replaces the {{mvar|\u03b4}} product on the right by the transverse {{mvar|\u03b4}}-''tensor'':\n:<math>\\delta_{\\perp\\ ij}(\\mathbf x ) = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^3}\\int d^3 \\mathbf{k} \\left(\\delta_{ij}-\\hat{u}_i\\hat{u}_j \\right) e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}} \\ , </math>\nwhere {{math|'''\u00fb'''}} is the unit vector of {{math|'''k'''}}, {{math|'''\u00fb''' {{=}} {{sfrac|'''k'''|''k''}}}}.

J.\" Vallow''' (born May 25, 2002) are two children from [[Rexburg, Idaho]], who have not been seen since September 23, 2019. Prompted by relatives concerned not only about the kids they hadn't heard from in weeks, but also about other suspicious incidents, in November 2019 police questioned their mother, Lori Vallow, about the children's whereabouts and welfare after J.J's grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, asked for a welfare check on their grandson. Vallow and her new husband Chad Daybell told the police that J.J. was staying with Melanie Gibbs in [[Arizona]], from where they had moved in early September. After not being able to contact her friend by phone, police asked Vallow to call Gibbs herself. Vallow said that they were at a movie theater watching ''[[Frozen 2]]'' and it was unlikely that she would answer her cell phone. When police reached Gibbs by phone later in the day, she told police that Joshua was not with her and had not been there for several months. More than a week later, Gibbs called police saying that both Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, had asked her to lie to police about J.J.'s whereabouts but she refused. The efforts of police trying to find him led them to know that his older sister Tylee Ryan was also missing. The day after being questioned, Vallow and Daybell left Rexburg, abandoning a storage locker full of children's items and photos, and were not seen until they were found in [[Kauai, Hawaii]] on Sunday, January 26, 2020. A search warrant was issued to search their rental car. They found items belong to Tylee and J.J., like their birth certificates, J.J.'s Ipad and Tylee's phone. They also gave them a court order demanding they produce the children by January 30. The children were not produced as ordered. \n\nFurther complicating the children's disappearances and lack of cooperation from the mother are a string of suspicious deaths and a shooting: In July 2019, Lori Vallow's estranged husband, Charles Vallow, was shot and killed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by Lori's brother, Alex Cox, allegedly in self-defense. Cox himself later died of unknown causes in December 2019. In early October Brandon Boudreaux, the then-estranged husband of Lori Vallow's niece, Melani Boudreaux, was shot at in the driveway of his [[Gilbert, Arizona]] home from a vehicle still registered to the deceased Charles Vallow, which prompted Boudreaux to hire a private detective to investigate the suspicious incidents. It was private investigators hired by Boudreaux that observed the children missing in Idaho. Also in October, Chad Daybell's wife Tammy Daybell was attacked in her driveway and a few weeks later, on the 19th, died of what was initially recorded as natural causes. But when Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow just two weeks after Tammy's death, law enforcement became suspicious and the cause of death is now under further investigation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=Hawaii News Now |title=FBI, Kauai police aiding Idaho authorities in case of missing children |url=https://www.weau.com/content/news/FBI-Kauai-police-aiding-Idaho-authorities-in-case-of-missing-children-567325611.html |accessdate=1 February 2020 |agency=WEAU 13 News |publisher=Hawaii News Now |date=27 January 2020 |ref=hnn20200127}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Capell |first1=John |last2=Torres |first2=Ella |title=Mother does not bring 2 missing Idaho children to police by deadline |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/deadline-looms-mom-produce-missing-kids/story?id=68617895 |accessdate=31 January 2020 |work=ABC News |agency=ABC News |publisher=ABC |date=January 30, 2020 |ref=abc2020Jan30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Truesdell |first1=Jeff |title=Idaho Mom Had 5 Days to Produce Her 2 Missing, Endangered Kids \u2014 and She Missed Deadline |url=https://people.com/crime/lori-vallow-idaho-mom-misses-deadline-produce-missing-kids/|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date= January 30, 2020 |ref=people20200131|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209141404/https://people.com/crime/lori-vallow-idaho-mom-misses-deadline-produce-missing-kids/|archive-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the mystery is Lori Vallow's and Chad Daybell's apparent obsession with certain \"[[end of times]]\" beliefs, about which Daybell has written a number of books, and together they have discussed in podcasts.

J.\" Vallow''' (born May 25, 2002) are two children from [[Rexburg, Idaho]], who have not been seen since September 23, 2019. Prompted by relatives concerned not only about the kids they hadn't heard from in weeks, but also about other suspicious incidents, in November 2019 police questioned their mother, Lori Vallow, about the children's whereabouts and welfare after J.J's grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, asked for a welfare check on their grandson. Vallow and her new husband Chad Daybell told the police that J.J. was staying with Melanie Gibbs in [[Arizona]], from where they had moved in early September. After not being able to contact her friend by phone, police asked Vallow to call Gibbs herself. Vallow said that they were at a movie theater watching ''[[Frozen 2]]'' and it was unlikely that she would answer her cell phone. When police reached Gibbs by phone later in the day, she told police that Joshua was not with her and had not been there for several months. More than a week later, Gibbs called police saying that both Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, had asked her to lie to police about J.J.'s whereabouts but she refused. The efforts of police trying to find him led them to know that his older sister Tylee Ryan was also missing. The day after being questioned, Vallow and Daybell left Rexburg, abandoning a storage locker full of children's items and photos, and were not seen until they were found in [[Kauai, Hawaii]] on Sunday, January 26, 2020. A search warrant was issued to search their rental car. They found items belong to Tylee and J.J., like their birth certificates, J.J.'s Ipad and Tylee's phone. They also gave them a court order demanding they produce the children by January 30. The children were not produced as ordered. \n\nFurther complicating the children's disappearances and lack of cooperation from the mother are a string of suspicious deaths and a shooting: In July 2019, Lori Vallow's estranged husband, Charles Vallow, was shot and killed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by Lori's brother, Alex Cox, allegedly in self-defense. Cox himself later died of unknown causes in December 2019. In early October Brandon Boudreaux, the then-estranged husband of Lori Vallow's niece, Melani Boudreaux, was shot at in the driveway of his [[Gilbert, Arizona]] home from a vehicle still registered to the deceased Charles Vallow, which prompted Boudreaux to hire a private detective to investigate the suspicious incidents. It was private investigators hired by Boudreaux that observed the children missing in Idaho. Also in October, Chad Daybell's wife Tammy Daybell was attacked in her driveway and a few weeks later, on the 19th, died of what was initially recorded as natural causes. But when Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow just two weeks after Tammy's death, law enforcement became suspicious and the cause of death is now under further investigation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=Hawaii News Now |title=FBI, Kauai police aiding Idaho authorities in case of missing children |url=https://www.weau.com/content/news/FBI-Kauai-police-aiding-Idaho-authorities-in-case-of-missing-children-567325611.html |accessdate=1 February 2020 |agency=WEAU 13 News |publisher=Hawaii News Now |date=27 January 2020 |ref=hnn20200127}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Capell |first1=John |last2=Torres |first2=Ella |title=Mother does not bring 2 missing Idaho children to police by deadline |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/deadline-looms-mom-produce-missing-kids/story?id=68617895 |accessdate=31 January 2020 |work=ABC News |agency=ABC News |publisher=ABC |date=January 30, 2020 |ref=abc2020Jan30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Truesdell |first1=Jeff |title=Idaho Mom Had 5 Days to Produce Her 2 Missing, Endangered Kids \u2014 and She Missed Deadline |url=https://people.com/crime/lori-vallow-idaho-mom-misses-deadline-produce-missing-kids/|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date= January 30, 2020 |ref=people20200131|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209141404/https://people.com/crime/lori-vallow-idaho-mom-misses-deadline-produce-missing-kids/|archive-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the mystery is Lori Vallow's and Chad Daybell's apparent obsession with certain \"[[end of times]]\" beliefs, about which Daybell has written a number of books, and together they have discussed in podcasts.

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

Hanford's namesake was [[James Madison Hanford]], an executive for the company.

[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LTLL-CT8 Wayman Leftrick Pryor], being one of the \"Mussel Slough Five\" and in the census, was also probably the only confirmed landowner from the incident in today's Hanford.

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels.
