{"title_page": "Epicureanism", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Epicurean}}\n[[Image:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Epicurus]] bust]]\n'''Epicureanism''' is a system of [[philosophy]] founded around 307 BC based upon the teachings of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]]. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]]. Later its main opponent became [[Stoicism]]. \n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (Latin for ''On the Nature of Things'') by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]].\n\nEpicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]]. His materialism led him to a [[Religious skepticism|general attack on superstition and divine intervention]]. Following the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic philosopher]]  [[Aristippus]], Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of [[ataraxia]] (tranquility and freedom from fear) and [[aponia]] (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the Epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Wilson, Catherine|isbn=9780199688326|edition=  First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=917374685|year = 2015}}</ref> \n\nAlthough Epicureanism is a form of [[hedonism]] insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \"hedonism\" as [[colloquially]] understood. \n\nEpicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established, such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Herculaneum]]. By the late 3rd Century CE Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly [[Neoplatonism]]) that were now in the ascendant. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and continues in the modern era.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Mytilene]], the capital of the island [[Lesbos]], and then in [[Lampsacus]], [[Epicurus]] taught and gained followers. In [[Athens]], Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", later the name of Epicurus' school.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=David Konstan|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/|title=Epicurus|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Its members included [[Hermarchus]], [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Colotes]], [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus|Polyaenus]], and [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]]. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.<ref>[http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/08/the-hidden-history-of-greco-roman-vegetarianism/ The Hidden History of Greco-Roman Vegetarianism]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Dombrowski|title=The Philosophy of Vegetarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSLoTGecabsC&pg=PA81|year=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-431-6|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Pyrrhonism]], one of the dominant schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=MacGillivray|first1=Erlend D|title=The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society.

Another ancient source is [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]], who composed a large inscription at [[Oenoanda]] in [[Lycia]].\n\nDeciphered carbonized [[scroll]]s obtained from the library at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]] contain a large number of works by [[Philodemus]], a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius|Diogenes]] reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents.<ref name=\"Stanford\" /> With growing dominance of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Peripateticism]], and later, [[Christianity]], Epicureanism declined.

In fact, Epicurus referred to life as a \"bitter gift\".\n\n{{quote|When we say . . . that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation.

It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.|Epicurus|''\"Letter to Menoeceus\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Epicurus, \"Letter to Menoeceus\", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X</ref>}}\n\nEpicureanism rejects immortality.

The ''Riddle of Epicurus'', or ''[[Problem of evil]]'', is a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods.

If he wants to and cannot, then he is weak \u2013 and this does not apply to god. If he can but does not want to, then he is spiteful \u2013 which is equally foreign to god's nature. If he neither wants to nor can, he is both weak and spiteful, and so not a god. If he wants to and can, which is the only thing fitting for a god, where then do bad things come from?

[[David Hume]] paraphrased this passage in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'': \"EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered. Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?\"</ref>}}\n\nThis type of ''[[trilemma]]'' argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek [[philosophical skepticism|skeptics]], and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]].<ref name=\"larrimore\">Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix\u2013xxi.

Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet [[Horace]], whose famous statement ''Carpe Diem'' (\"Seize the Day\") illustrates the philosophy, as well as [[Lucretius]], who wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet [[Virgil]] was another prominent Epicurean (see [[Lucretius]] for further details). The Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus of Gadara]], until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the [[Villa of the Papyri]]. In the second century CE, comedian [[Lucian of Samosata]] and wealthy promoter of philosophy [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]] were prominent Epicureans.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], during the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]].<ref>Cf.

And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsofthomas10jeffiala/writingsofthomas10jeffiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson;\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref></blockquote>Other modern-day Epicureans were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Saint-Evremond]], [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Frances Wright]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].\n\n[[Christopher Hitchens]] referred to himself as an Epicurean.<ref>[http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?ContentGuid=dab6495c-e875-4fd1-9fa6-53809a40ef15&RadioShowId=5 Townhall.com::Talk Radio Online::Radio Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In France, where perfumer/restaurateur G\u00e9rald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean,<ref>Anon., [https://ideamensch.com/gerald-ghislain ''G\u00e9rald Ghislain \u2013 Creator of The Scent of Departure''].

[[Humanistic Judaism]] as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n\n== Modern usage and misconceptions ==\nIn modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; ''Epicureanism'' implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n\nBecause Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (''telos''), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ''[[ataraxia]]'' (tranquility, freedom from fear) and ''[[aponia]]'' (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEpicurus referred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\", to the \"pleasure of the stomach\".<ref>Cyril Bailey, Epicurus: The Extant Remains, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926, p.131</ref>  While twentieth-century commentary has generally sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency of the lower-case epicureanism of meals with Epicurean materialism overall has more recently been explained.<ref>Michael Symons, \"Epicurus, the foodies\u2019 philosopher\", pp. 13-30, in Fritz Allhoff and Dave Monroe, eds, Food & Philosophy: Eat, think, and be merry, Malden (MA, USA): Blackwell Publishing, 2007</ref>\nWhile Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called \"The Garden\" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Francis Bacon]] wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:\n \n<blockquote>There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks.<ref>Francis Bacon, Apothegms 280</ref>  </blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epicureanism}}\n* [[Charvaka]], a hedonic Indian school\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* ''[[Epicurea]]''\n* [[Epicurean paradox]]\n* [[Epikoros]]\n* [[Hedonic treadmill]]\n* [[List of English translations of De rerum natura|List of English translations of ''De rerum natura'']]\n* [[Philosophy of happiness]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Zeno of Sidon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Dane R.

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]]. Later its main opponent became [[Stoicism]]. \n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (Latin for ''On the Nature of Things'') by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]].\n\nEpicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]]. His materialism led him to a [[Religious skepticism|general attack on superstition and divine intervention]]. Following the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic philosopher]]  [[Aristippus]], Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of [[ataraxia]] (tranquility and freedom from fear) and [[aponia]] (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the Epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Wilson, Catherine|isbn=9780199688326|edition=  First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=917374685|year = 2015}}</ref> \n\nAlthough Epicureanism is a form of [[hedonism]] insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \"hedonism\" as [[colloquially]] understood. \n\nEpicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established, such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Herculaneum]]. By the late 3rd Century CE Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly [[Neoplatonism]]) that were now in the ascendant. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and continues in the modern era.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Mytilene]], the capital of the island [[Lesbos]], and then in [[Lampsacus]], [[Epicurus]] taught and gained followers. In [[Athens]], Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", later the name of Epicurus' school.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=David Konstan|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/|title=Epicurus|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Its members included [[Hermarchus]], [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Colotes]], [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus|Polyaenus]], and [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]]. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.<ref>[http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/08/the-hidden-history-of-greco-roman-vegetarianism/ The Hidden History of Greco-Roman Vegetarianism]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Dombrowski|title=The Philosophy of Vegetarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSLoTGecabsC&pg=PA81|year=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-431-6|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Pyrrhonism]], one of the dominant schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=MacGillivray|first1=Erlend D|title=The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society.

[[David Hume]] paraphrased this passage in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'': \"EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered.

Contains Epicurean tetrapharmakos from Philodemus' Adversus Sophistas.]]\nTetrapharmakos, or \"The four-part cure\", is [[Philodemus of Gadara]]'s basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life, based on the first four of [[Epicurus]]' [[Principal Doctrines]]. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:\n\n{{quote|Don't fear god,<br />Don't worry about death;<br />What is good is easy to get, and<br />What is terrible is easy to endure.|[[Philodemus]]|[[Herculaneum]] Papyrus, 1005, 4.9\u201314}}\n\n==Notable Epicureans==\n[[File:Lucretius, De rerum natura.jpg|thumb|''[[De rerum natura]]'' manuscript, copied by an Augustinian friar for Pope [[Sixtus IV]], c. 1483, after the discovery of an early manuscript in 1417 by the humanist and papal secretary [[Poggio Bracciolini]]]]\nOne of the earliest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers espousing Epicureanism was [[Amafinius]]. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet [[Horace]], whose famous statement ''Carpe Diem'' (\"Seize the Day\") illustrates the philosophy, as well as [[Lucretius]], who wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet [[Virgil]] was another prominent Epicurean (see [[Lucretius]] for further details). The Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus of Gadara]], until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the [[Villa of the Papyri]]. In the second century CE, comedian [[Lucian of Samosata]] and wealthy promoter of philosophy [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]] were prominent Epicureans.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], during the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]].<ref>Cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] & Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).</ref> His father-in-law, [[Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Caesoninus_(consul_58_BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]] was also an adept of the school.\n\nIn modern times [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to himself as an Epicurean:<blockquote>If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsofthomas10jeffiala/writingsofthomas10jeffiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson;\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref></blockquote>Other modern-day Epicureans were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Saint-Evremond]], [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Frances Wright]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].\n\n[[Christopher Hitchens]] referred to himself as an Epicurean.<ref>[http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?ContentGuid=dab6495c-e875-4fd1-9fa6-53809a40ef15&RadioShowId=5 Townhall.com::Talk Radio Online::Radio Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In France, where perfumer/restaurateur G\u00e9rald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean,<ref>Anon., [https://ideamensch.com/gerald-ghislain ''G\u00e9rald Ghislain \u2013 Creator of The Scent of Departure'']. IdeaMensch, July 14, 2011.</ref> [[Michel Onfray]] is developing a [[post-modern]] approach to Epicureanism.<ref>[[Michel Onfray]], ''La puissance d'exister: Manifeste h\u00e9doniste'', Grasset, 2006</ref> In his recent book titled ''[[The Swerve]]'', [[Stephen Greenblatt]] identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. [[Humanistic Judaism]] as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n\n== Modern usage and misconceptions ==\nIn modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; ''Epicureanism'' implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n\nBecause Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (''telos''), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ''[[ataraxia]]'' (tranquility, freedom from fear) and ''[[aponia]]'' (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nInstead, Epicurus preferred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\", to the \"pleasure of the stomach\".<ref>Cyril Bailey, Epicurus: The Extant Remains, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926, p.131</ref>  While twentieth-century commentary has generally sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency of the lower-case epicureanism of meals with Epicurean materialism overall has more recently been explained.<ref>Michael Symons, \"Epicurus, the foodies\u2019 philosopher\", pp. 13-30, in Fritz Allhoff and Dave Monroe, eds, Food & Philosophy: Eat, think, and be merry, Malden (MA, USA): Blackwell Publishing, 2007</ref>\nWhile Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called \"The Garden\" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Francis Bacon]] wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:\n \n<blockquote>There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks.<ref>Francis Bacon, Apothegms 280</ref>  </blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epicureanism}}\n* [[Charvaka]], a hedonic Indian school\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* ''[[Epicurea]]''\n* [[Epicurean paradox]]\n* [[Epikoros]]\n* [[Hedonic treadmill]]\n* [[List of English translations of De rerum natura|List of English translations of ''De rerum natura'']]\n* [[Philosophy of happiness]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Zeno of Sidon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Dane R.

He was influenced by his military family members and nursed the idea of serving in the Army since his childhood. After his basic education in his native place, he got selected to join the Army and was happy to achieve his childhood dream.\n\n== Military career ==\nOn 26 August 1955, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh joined [[Bombay Sappers]] as a recruit and got appointed as a sapper after his initial training. After two years, on 19 July 1957, he got posted in the depot battalion (T). After serving the company for four and half years, he was posted to training battalion in Oct 1962.

Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n<br />\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Notability|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n[[Naib subedar|Naib Subedar]] '''Gurnam Singh''', [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]] (18 Aug 1935 - 23 Sep 1973) was a [[Junior commissioned officer|Junior Commissioned officer]] (JCO) in [[Indian Army]].

On 5 January 1971, he was then appointed as an instructor at \u201c[[College of Military Engineering, Pune|College of Military Engineering]]\u201d, [[Pune]] after serving with 22 and 23 Field Companies for few years.\n\n== Mine Explosin ==\nOn the 23rd September 1973, a demonstration was arranged by the College of Military Engineering for the visiting staff and student officers of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington.\u00a0 One part of the demonstration was the actual firing of the Charge Line Mine Clearing, an explosive device for the clearing of enemy mine fields, which was recently introduced in the Army. Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n<br />\n", "name_user": "Koushik Pain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurnam_Singh_(soldier)"}

He is often joined by his brother, [[Luigi]], and occasionally by other members of the ''Mario'' cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed [[level (video gaming)|levels]]. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario [[Damsel in distress|rescuing the kidnapped]] [[Princess Peach]] from the primary [[antagonist]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. The first title in the series, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game released since.  These include a multitude of [[power-up]]s and [[item (gaming)|items]] that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into both giant and miniature sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5710212/nintendos-revised-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=Nintendo's Revised History Of Super Mario Bros.|first=Michael|last=McWhertor}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Super Mario'' series is part of the greater ''Mario'' franchise.

It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]] of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).<ref name=\"TMKTheBad\">{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros.

It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds of four levels each. The last level of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. At that time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}\nIn ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland.

This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up to four times before dying. Mushrooms count for two lives, and coins are used for inter-level [[slot machine]] minigame.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\" />\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6\u201310 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] (\"Doom Ship\") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long ''P-Wing'' allowing permanent flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land}}\n''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game & Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. Power-ups include hearts, which gives Mario an extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and small bouncing ball which Mario throws referred to as \"superballs\". The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.\n\n=== ''Super Mario World'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario World}}\n''Super Mario World'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Unlike ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', where each world map is individual, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3'''s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape. The game was followed by the prequel ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', which is also considered the first game in the [[Yoshi series]].\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}\n''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which retroactively became the first of a spin-off series, ''[[Wario (series)#Wario Land series|Wario Land]]''.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 64}}\n''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.<ref name=\"NP88\">{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&nbsp;\u2014 Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14\u201323}}</ref> The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}\n''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title. It was released in 2002 for the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], going by the name of [[Shadow Mario]], appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}</ref> ''Sunshine'' introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] , as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}\n''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of ''Super Mario Bros. Deluxe''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, enemies as pipes and blocks. The Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), where the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to a much smaller size, allowing him to fit through tight spaces and access places normally unreachable.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}\n''Super Mario Galaxy'' was launched in 2007 for the [[Wii]]. It is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between \"[[Galaxy|galaxies]]\" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2''.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}\nIn ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Princess Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom allows the player to launch its character high into the air through shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances sliding traction, speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. All characters can ride [[Yoshi]]. The levels are organised into individually themed open-worlds reminiscent of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 to an important commercial success, and won several awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' game on a handheld console, since all previous games were either 2D or re-edits of former games. As an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, it tried to simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. This game was released to critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'' for the DS, was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal  to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.

It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros.

Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}\n''Super Mario Maker'' is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> which allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Run}}\n''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 on the [[iOS]] platform, then in March 2017 on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first official ''Mario'' game developed for non-Nintendo hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation) , as well as the first official Super Mario game developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]]. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand.\n\nIn this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps. Collecting all coins in a precise level unlocks a set of 5 pink coins in said level for Mario (the player) to collect, allowing extended replayability. Collecting these 5 coins unlocks another set of 5 purple coins, which upon collecting unlocks another set of 5 coins, black this time and much harder to collect. This further multiplies the game's length, through requiring the player to beat a single level 4 times to fully complete it.\n\nThis game also includes a \"Toad Rally\" mode, quite similar to the \"VS Boo\" mode of ''Super Mario Bros Deluxe'', in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create its own \"Mushroom Kingdom\" map, using mechanics similar to ''[[FarmVille|Farmville]]'', into ''Super Mario Run''<nowiki/>'s third gameplay mode.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}\nReleased on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world \"sandbox\" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily \"capture\" enemies, harmless life forms and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, and earned multiple awards. This game adventures through many different kingdoms, in addition to the standard Mushroom Kingdom Mario's adventures usually take place in ; and is the very first one to include a vocal theme song, \"Jump Up, Super Star!\".\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker 2}}\nOn February 13, 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' was announced. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is very similar in design to its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker''. It introduced many new items, themes, and enemies, as well as an online multiplayer mode. The game was released on June 28, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n== Remakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! System\n! Year\n!

Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.\nIn the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' introduced the [[overworld]], a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's choice.<ref name=\"NP-10-Preview\">{{Cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3''| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 10| date=January\u2013February 1990 | pages = 56\u201359| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced levels with multiple exits.\n\n3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: [[open world]] exploration based games and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Miyamoto Offers a Few New Super Mario Odyssey Details|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/miyamoto-offers-a-few-new-super-mario-odyssey-details|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=IGN|date=January 13, 2017}}</ref> Levels in the open world games, ''[[Super Mario 64|64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine|Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360 degree movement.

The most iconic of these is the Super [[Mushroom]].<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /><ref name=\"amanita\">{{cite journal |author=Li, C.|author2=Oberlies, N. H.  | date=December 2005 |title=The most widely recognized mushroom: chemistry of the genus ''Amanita'' |journal=Life Sciences |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=532\u201338 |pmid=16203016 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2005.09.003 | quote=Idealized representations of this species permeate popular culture.

When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /> When Mario is in his \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' allows Mario to run up walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros. U|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Mega Mushroom'', introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and further appearing in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is a more recent addition to the series that grows Mario into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them. It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called \"Mushroom\"<ref name=\"Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet\">{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}</ref> that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not in its [[Super Mario Maker 2|2019 sequel]]) provides a \"costume\" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.\n\n===== 1-Ups =====\nThe ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.\n\n==== Projectile flowers ====\nThe flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.<ref name=\"nsmbw\" /> In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.\n\n==== Invincibility ====\nInvincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a \"Starman\",<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|date=1990}}</ref> an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the \"Super Star\" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1995}}</ref> and the \"Rainbow Star\" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors \u2014 and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability \u2014 while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).\n\n==== Power Stars and course tokens ====\nThe games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.\n\n==== Flying ====\nFlight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and the ''Super Mario Maker'' series. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series and ''Super Mario Maker'' series, the Propeller Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Mario has limited flight provided by the Propeller Cap.  In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.\n\n==== Power-up suits ====\nSeveral suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a \"Boomerang Suit\" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.\n\n==== Coins ====\n''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' series, after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect 100 purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry \"Luma\" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.\n\n=== Luigi and other playable characters ===\n\nThe series often features the option to play as other characters, Luigi in the most instances. Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in ''The Lost Levels'', ''Galaxy 2'', ''New Super Luigi U'' and the special worlds in ''3D Land''; these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Rosalina, [[Mii|Miis]] and Nabbit. Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities. ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not ''Super Mario Maker 2'') includes costumes that depict many more characters.\n\n=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===\n{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}\nThe Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_UefdMONDLIC&dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda |publisher= Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9691-2 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n=== Yoshi ===\nMario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.\n\n== Settings ==\n* The {{nihongo foot|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd|Kinoko \u014ckoku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world issued from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are \"Mushroom Kingdoms\", ruled by their own kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Land (a desert kingdom), Water Land (an ocean kingdom), Giant Land (a kingdom where everything is larger), Sky Land (a kingdom which consists of a peninsula at ground level, and a large plain amidst the sky), Ice Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Land (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is Dark Land and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states that the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland are range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).\n* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.<ref>Super Mario World instruction manual</ref> '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and the Special Zone.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which apparently belongs to Mario.\n* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.\n* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza.

The ''Galaxy'' titles, extolled for their creativity, level design, visuals, and music, have been considered to be not only two of the best ''Mario'' games ever made but also among the greatest games of all time in general, according to sites such as [[IGN]] and [[TopTenReviews]]. ''Odyssey'' was praised for successfully reviving the sandbox-style gameplay last seen in ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Sunshine'' and its introduction of the \"capture\" mechanic. [[GameRankings]], a website that aggregates game scores and rankings from well-established video game critics, gave ''Super Mario Galaxy'' an aggregate ranking of 97.64%,<ref name=\"odyssey\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/915692-super-mario-galaxy/index.html |title=''Super Mario Galaxy'' Reviews |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref> making it the best-ranked game on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html |title=Reviews and News Articles |publisher=GameRankings |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was also highly commercially and critically successful, being the third-best-selling game for the Nintendo 3DS. Its sequel, ''Super Mario 3D World'', received similar critical praise and is among the Wii U's best-selling titles.\n\n=== Sales ===\nGames in the ''Super Mario'' series have had consistently strong sales. ''Super Mario Bros.'' is the second best-selling single video game (second to ''[[Wii Sports]]''), with 40.23 million units sold. It is also the best-selling [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console title, with its two sequels, ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' (18 million copies) and ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (10 million copies), ranking in second and third place respectively.<ref name=\"ownt\" /> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' is the best-selling game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console, selling 20 million copies. ''Super Mario World'' is also the seventh best-selling game of all time. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' sold the most copies for the [[Nintendo 64]] (11 million), whereas ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' is the second best-selling game (5.5 million) on the [[GameCube]] (second to ''[[Super Smash Bros.

''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' has sold 12.79 million units {{as of|2018|3|lc=y}}, which was the best-selling 3D title in the series until 2019, and is the ninth best-selling game for the [[Wii]].<ref name=\"WiiSales\"/> Its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' has sold 7.41 million units, placing in twelfth.<ref name=\"supermariobestselling\"/> ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has sold 16.59 million units as of December 2019, making it the best-selling 3D title in the series to date, and among the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games|best-selling games for the]] [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref name=\"SwitchSales\"/> ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

''[[Super Mario Land]]'' has sold 18.14 million copies, and is the fourth best-selling game for the [[Game Boy]]. Its sequel, ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'', sold 2.7 million copies, placing sixth. ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] sold 30.79 million units, making it the best-selling game for the console, and the best-selling portable entry.\n\nFor all console and handheld games that have not been bundled with a console, ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is the fourth best-selling game, whereas ''New Super Mario Bros.'' is fifth, ''Super Mario Land'' is eleventh, and ''Super Mario 64'' is eighteenth.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=no | c=Category:Mario_(video game series) | v=no | q=Super Mario Bros. | s=no | b=no | n =no | display=''Super Mario''}}\n*  {{Official website|mario.nintendo.com}}\n\n{{Super Mario}}\n{{Mario franchise}}\n{{Main franchises by Nintendo}}\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Mario video games]]\n[[Category:Super Mario| ]]\n[[Category:Nintendo franchises]]\n[[Category:Mario platform games]]\n[[Category:Video games about size change]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the platform video game series|the character|Mario|the entire media franchise as a whole|Mario (franchise)|other uses of \"Super Mario\"|Super Mario (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|platform video game series from Nintendo's Mario franchise}}\n<!-- Please DO NOT add Super Mario Bros.

He is often joined by his brother, [[Luigi]], and occasionally by other members of the ''Mario'' cast.

The games have simple plots, typically with Mario [[Damsel in distress|rescuing the kidnapped]] [[Princess Peach]] from the primary [[antagonist]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. The first title in the series, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game released since.

It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]] of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).<ref name=\"TMKTheBad\">{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros.

It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds of four levels each. The last level of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. At that time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}\nIn ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland. Based on a discarded prototype,<ref name=\"Secret History of SMB2\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2.ars |title=The Secret History of Super Mario Bros. 2 |date=April 3, 2011 |publisher=wired.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref> the game was instead originally released as ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'' in Japan, and was ultimately converted back into a ''Mario'' game for the rest of the world as ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', before being named in Japan as ''Super Mario USA'' as part of ''Super Mario All-Stars''.\n\nOne of the game's most defining aspects is the four player characters: not only Mario, but Luigi, Princess Peach (who's no longer under Bowser's grip) and Toad are available for single-player action, each with defined character movements: Luigi jumps higher, the Princess glides through the sky for a short amount of time, etc. Characters here also can pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies. This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up to four times before dying. Mushrooms count for two lives, and coins are used for inter-level [[slot machine]] minigame.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\" />\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6\u201310 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] (\"Doom Ship\") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long ''P-Wing'' allowing permanent flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land}}\n''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game & Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. Power-ups include hearts, which gives Mario an extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and small bouncing ball which Mario throws referred to as \"superballs\". The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.\n\n=== ''Super Mario World'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario World}}\n''Super Mario World'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Unlike ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', where each world map is individual, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3'''s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape. The game was followed by the prequel ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', which is also considered the first game in the [[Yoshi series]].\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}\n''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which retroactively became the first of a spin-off series, ''[[Wario (series)#Wario Land series|Wario Land]]''.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 64}}\n''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.<ref name=\"NP88\">{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&nbsp;\u2014 Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14\u201323}}</ref> The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}\n''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title. It was released in 2002 for the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], going by the name of [[Shadow Mario]], appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}</ref> ''Sunshine'' introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] , as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}\n''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of ''Super Mario Bros. Deluxe''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, enemies as pipes and blocks. The Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), where the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to a much smaller size, allowing him to fit through tight spaces and access places normally unreachable.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}\n''Super Mario Galaxy'' was launched in 2007 for the [[Wii]]. It is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between \"[[Galaxy|galaxies]]\" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2''.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}\nIn ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Princess Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom allows the player to launch its character high into the air through shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances sliding traction, speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. All characters can ride [[Yoshi]]. The levels are organised into individually themed open-worlds reminiscent of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 to an important commercial success, and won several awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' game on a handheld console, since all previous games were either 2D or re-edits of former games. As an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, it tried to simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. This game was released to critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'' for the DS, was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal  to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. U}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. U'', the [[Wii U]] follow-up to ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', was released in November 2012, in North America. It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros.

Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}\n''Super Mario Maker'' is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> which allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Run}}\n''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 on the [[iOS]] platform, then in March 2017 on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first official ''Mario'' game developed for non-Nintendo hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation) , as well as the first official Super Mario game developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]]. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand.\n\nIn this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps. Collecting all coins in a precise level unlocks a set of 5 pink coins in said level for Mario (the player) to collect, allowing extended replayability. Collecting these 5 coins unlocks another set of 5 purple coins, which upon collecting unlocks another set of 5 coins, black this time and much harder to collect. This further multiplies the game's length, through requiring the player to beat a single level 4 times to fully complete it.\n\nThis game also includes a \"Toad Rally\" mode, quite similar to the \"VS Boo\" mode of ''Super Mario Bros Deluxe'', in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create its own \"Mushroom Kingdom\" map, using mechanics similar to ''[[FarmVille|Farmville]]'', into ''Super Mario Run''<nowiki/>'s third gameplay mode.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}\nReleased on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world \"sandbox\" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily \"capture\" enemies, harmless life forms and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, and earned multiple awards. This game adventures through many different kingdoms, in addition to the standard Mushroom Kingdom Mario's adventures usually take place in ; and is the very first one to include a vocal theme song, \"Jump Up, Super Star!\".\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker 2}}\nOn February 13, 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' was announced. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is very similar in design to its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker''. It introduced many new items, themes, and enemies, as well as an online multiplayer mode. The game was released on June 28, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n== Remakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! System\n! Year\n!

Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.\nIn the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' introduced the [[overworld]], a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's choice.<ref name=\"NP-10-Preview\">{{Cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3''| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 10| date=January\u2013February 1990 | pages = 56\u201359| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced levels with multiple exits.\n\n3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: [[open world]] exploration based games and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Miyamoto Offers a Few New Super Mario Odyssey Details|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/miyamoto-offers-a-few-new-super-mario-odyssey-details|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=IGN|date=January 13, 2017}}</ref> Levels in the open world games, ''[[Super Mario 64|64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine|Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360 degree movement.

When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /> When Mario is in his \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' allows Mario to run up walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros.

It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called \"Mushroom\"<ref name=\"Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet\">{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}</ref> that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not in its [[Super Mario Maker 2|2019 sequel]]) provides a \"costume\" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.\n\n===== 1-Ups =====\nThe ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.\n\n==== Projectile flowers ====\nThe flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.<ref name=\"nsmbw\" /> In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.\n\n==== Invincibility ====\nInvincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a \"Starman\",<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|date=1990}}</ref> an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the \"Super Star\" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1995}}</ref> and the \"Rainbow Star\" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors \u2014 and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability \u2014 while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).\n\n==== Power Stars and course tokens ====\nThe games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.\n\n==== Flying ====\nFlight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and the ''Super Mario Maker'' series. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series and ''Super Mario Maker'' series, the Propeller Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Mario has limited flight provided by the Propeller Cap.  In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.\n\n==== Power-up suits ====\nSeveral suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a \"Boomerang Suit\" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.\n\n==== Coins ====\n''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' series, after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect 100 purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry \"Luma\" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.\n\n=== Luigi and other playable characters ===\n\nThe series often features the option to play as other characters, Luigi in the most instances. Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in ''The Lost Levels'', ''Galaxy 2'', ''New Super Luigi U'' and the special worlds in ''3D Land''; these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Rosalina, [[Mii|Miis]] and Nabbit. Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities. ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not ''Super Mario Maker 2'') includes costumes that depict many more characters.\n\n=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===\n{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}\nThe Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_UefdMONDLIC&dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda |publisher= Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9691-2 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n=== Yoshi ===\nMario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.\n\n== Settings ==\n* The {{nihongo foot|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd|Kinoko \u014ckoku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world issued from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are \"Mushroom Kingdoms\", ruled by their own kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Land (a desert kingdom), Water Land (an ocean kingdom), Giant Land (a kingdom where everything is larger), Sky Land (a kingdom which consists of a peninsula at ground level, and a large plain amidst the sky), Ice Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Land (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is Dark Land and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states that the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland are range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).\n* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.<ref>Super Mario World instruction manual</ref> '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and the Special Zone.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which apparently belongs to Mario.\n* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.\n* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza. Besides Delfino Plaza, the different locations of Delfino Island are Delfino Airstrip, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, Gelato Beach, Pinna Park, Sirena Beach, Noki Bay, Pianta Village, and Corona Mountain. While Isle Delfino has only appeared in one game in the ''Super Mario'' series, it has been commonly used in ''Mario'' spin-off games, especially the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' are set in outer space and contain various galaxies and planets.\n* ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' takes place in the '''Sprixie Kingdom''', where the Sprixies live.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has Mario traveling across the globe in a hat-shaped airship called the Odyssey; thus, several new regions known as \"kingdoms\" are introduced in the game, including a New York-inspired urban area called the '''Metro Kingdom''', a dry desert land called the '''Sand Kingdom''', and a food-filled world called the '''Luncheon Kingdom'''.\n\n== Development and history ==\n{{See also|Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong Jr.|Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nMuch of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games. The original [[Super Mario Bros. theme]], composed by [[Koji Kondo]], has become one of the most well known video game themes around the world.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web |title=GDC 2007: Mario Maestro Shares His Secrets |url=http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=February 16, 2009 |date=March 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710232628/http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The theme from the underwater levels of ''Super Mario Bros.'' frequently appears as [[title screen]] music in the series, including in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', the main intros and titles of all four ''Super Mario Advance'' titles, and the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' versions of the four NES games.\n\n== Reception ==\n<!-- WARNING - Only include original title.

He was also the only member who was not a rapper at the time of the group's formation. He was extensively mentored by the [[GZA]] during his early days with the group, evident in the similar flow they both employ. He derived his rap name from the 1978 [[kung fu]] film ''[[The 36th Chamber of Shaolin|Shaolin Master Killer]]'', (Shao Lin san shi liu fang). Masta only appeared on one track on the Wu-Tang Clan's first album, in the closing verse to \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin\". Masta only narrowly made the track, and was almost left off in favor of [[Killah Priest]]. In fact, on the ''No Said Date'' DVD, Killah Priest claims that he and Masta Killa were in competition for the spot on \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\", and while Killah Priest fell asleep, Masta Killa stayed up all night writing and Killah Priest woke up the next morning to Masta Killa's verse. Since he was a developing rapper at the time ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' was being written, his verse in \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin\" was the only one that could hold up with the other, more experienced Wu-Tang members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/interview/mkilla06.html |title=RapReview Feature for October 3, 2006 \u2013 Masta Killa Interview |website=RapReviews.com |author=Adam Bernard  |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first round of solo projects, he made several appearances on tracks now considered Wu-Tang classics, such as \"Winter Warz\", \"Duel of the Iron Mic\", and \"Glaciers of Ice\". His flow at the time attracted attention for being very slow and laid-back, in contrast to the more manic, forceful styles of members like [[Inspectah Deck]] and [[Ghostface Killah]]. Masta Killa is also the Clansman fondest of [[China|Chinese]] [[martial art]]s imagery. In 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan's second album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'' saw Masta become a mainstay in the group's line-up with regular appearances throughout the double album.\n\nMasta Killa was the last member to release a solo project, after it was delayed for several years and finally released in June 2004 with the title ''[[No Said Date]]''; critically acclaimed, it became independent label [[Nature Sounds]]' best-selling album, notable for featuring every core member of the Wu-Tang Clan on the album after a period in the group's history that lacked unity. His second album, ''[[Made in Brooklyn]]'', was released on August 8, 2006, and includes production from [[Pete Rock]] and [[MF Doom]]. \"Ringing Bells\", the [[Wu-Tang Clan affiliates#Bronze Nazareth|Bronze Nazareth]]-produced lead single from the album, was released in March 2006.

He was also the only member who was not a rapper at the time of the group's formation. He was extensively mentored by the [[GZA]] during his early days with the group, evident in the similar flow they both employ. He derived his rap name from the 1978 [[kung fu]] film ''[[The 36th Chamber of Shaolin|Shaolin Master Killer]]'', (Shao Lin san shi liu fang). Masta only appeared on one track on the Wu-Tang Clan's first album, in the closing verse to \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin\". Masta only narrowly made the track, and was almost left off in favor of [[Killah Priest]]. In fact, on the ''No Said Date'' DVD, Killah Priest claims that he and Masta Killa were in competition for the spot on \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\", and while Killah Priest fell asleep, Masta Killa stayed up all night writing and Killah Priest woke up the next morning to Masta Killa's verse. Since he was a developing rapper at the time ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' was being written, his verse in \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin\" was the only one that could hold up with the other, more experienced Wu-Tang members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/interview/mkilla06.html |title=RapReview Feature for October 3, 2006 \u2013 Masta Killa Interview |website=RapReviews.com |author=Adam Bernard  |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first round of solo projects, he made several appearances on tracks now considered Wu-Tang classics, such as \"Winter Warz\", \"Duel of the Iron Mic\", and \"Glaciers of Ice\". His flow at the time attracted attention for being very slow and laid-back, in contrast to the more manic, forceful styles of members like [[Inspectah Deck]] and [[Ghostface Killah]]. Masta Killa is also the Clansman fondest of [[China|Chinese]] [[martial art]]s imagery. In 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan's second album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'' saw Masta become a mainstay in the group's line-up with regular appearances throughout the double album.\n\nMasta Killa was the last member to release a solo project, after it was delayed for several years and finally released in June 2004 with the title ''[[No Said Date]]''; critically acclaimed, it became independent label [[Nature Sounds]]' best-selling album, notable for featuring every core member of the Wu-Tang Clan on the album after a period in the group's history that lacked unity. His second album, ''[[Made in Brooklyn]]'', was released on August 8, 2006, and includes production from [[Pete Rock]] and [[MF Doom]]. \"Ringing Bells\", the [[Wu-Tang Clan affiliates#Bronze Nazareth|Bronze Nazareth]]-produced lead single from the album, was released in March 2006. Also in 2006, Masta Killa became the latest in a succession of hip hop artists to endorse [[PETA]], and participated in an advertisement for the organization to promote [[animal rights]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.net/wu-tang-clan/news/masta-killa-praised-for-being-animal-friendly_1057451 |title=Masta Killa Praised For Being Animal-friendly |website=contactmusic.net |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |quote=I'll do anything that's going to save animals.
