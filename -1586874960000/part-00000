It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 8, 2015, and was released on September 16, 2015. It was succeeded by [[iOS 10]] on September 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10 With Redesigned Lock Screen, New Messages Features, Third-Party Siri, and More |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 13, 2016 |access-date=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228010133/http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\niOS 9 incorporated many feature updates to built-in apps. Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

In iOS 9, the use of Metal is expanded to let it handle many of the core user interface elements and graphics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/9-reasons-why-ios-9-will-make-your-old-iphone-feel-like-new-1519281|title=9 reasons why iOS 9 will make your old iPhone feel like new|last=McClelland|first=David|date=September 10, 2015|website=[[International Business Times]]|publisher=[[IBT Media]]|access-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090946/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/9-reasons-why-ios-9-will-make-your-old-iphone-feel-like-new-1519281|archive-date=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Proactivity ===\nIntelligence is one of the main features in iOS 9, consisting of the newly integrated [[Siri]] and Search (previously known as Spotlight), as well as \"proactivity\" throughout the operating system. iOS is now more aware of contextual information (such as time and location), and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort. When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath. To make the mask more alive, the original beaded domes as the eyes were made iridescent, and Hedison may wriggle his \u201cproboscis\u201d through a wooden plug held in his mouth.<ref name=\":6\" /> The budget was claimed to be $480,000 by Lippert, and $28,000 of which was spent on the construction of the laboratory set.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Ryon|date=23 September 1962|title=Third-run film king tells industry's woes|url=|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> The film was released in July 1958 and became the biggest hit of Fox that year, grossing $3,000,000 in domestically. However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D. Dillard]], the director of the American drama film ''[[Sleight]],'' a plan of remaking David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'' was at its early phase of negotiations. Dillard disclosed in the interview that he might work with Alex Theurer, the co-writer of the Movie ''Sleight,'' for the remake movie: \"''For me \u2013 and this would be about The Fly, but this is also about Alex and my approach to remakes because post-Sleight that has been the conversation for what a lot of big flashy studio gigs are \u2013 no matter what, we want to start with character. \"'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/j-d-dillards-the-fly-remake-pitch/|title=\u2018The Fly\u2019 Remake: J.D.

He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath. To make the mask more alive, the original beaded domes as the eyes were made iridescent, and Hedison may wriggle his \u201cproboscis\u201d through a wooden plug held in his mouth.<ref name=\":6\" /> The budget was claimed to be $480,000 by Lippert, and $28,000 of which was spent on the construction of the laboratory set.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Ryon|date=23 September 1962|title=Third-run film king tells industry's woes|url=|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> The film was released in July 1958 and became the biggest hit of Fox that year, grossing $3,000,000 in domestically. However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D. Dillard]], the director of the American drama film ''[[Sleight]],'' a plan of remaking David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'' was at its early phase of negotiations. Dillard disclosed in the interview that he might work with Alex Theurer, the co-writer of the Movie ''Sleight,'' for the remake movie: \"''For me \u2013 and this would be about The Fly, but this is also about Alex and my approach to remakes because post-Sleight that has been the conversation for what a lot of big flashy studio gigs are \u2013 no matter what, we want to start with character. \"'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/j-d-dillards-the-fly-remake-pitch/|title=\u2018The Fly\u2019 Remake: J.D.
