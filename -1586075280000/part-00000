{{!}}|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Map of Batu Pahat District, Johor.svg|thumb|Yong Peng Town (''Bandar Yong Peng'') in Batu Pahat District]]\n\nDuring the reign of Sultan [[Abu Bakar of Johor]] and under the influence of the British rule in the 1870s, a policy was initiated to modernise Johor and increase tax revenue by opening up more of the forest and swamp area for plantation purposes (initially for spices such as [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[Uncaria|gambier]]; then followed by [[rubber]]).  But to do so, they need massive number of workers.  Coincidentally the political and social chaos in Southern China during that period (ref: [[History of China]]) made the Chinese migrants an obvious choice.<ref name=\"ae\"/>  Some of these early Chinese pioneers travelled from the river mouth starting from Batu Pahat and along the Bekok River (Sungai Bekok) and settled upon a fertile land not far from where Sungai Bekok and Sungai Sedi meets.\n\nIn fact, in 1800, there were only five Malay houses standing on the banks of Sungai Bekok and on Bukit Jambu (once sited the Bee Seng Sawmill and now the Yong Peng District Council). The town was known at that time as \u2018Sri Bertam\u2019, named after a tree by the name \u2018Bertam Tree\u2019 in Kampong Bukit Jambu. The Malays were then ruled by Arujamin Bin Runshut and most of them had just escaped from the Dutch after losing the war to the latter in Acheh.\n\nIn November 1847, four Chinese immigrants from [[Chaozhou]] led by Boo Koh Lak Loo (better known as Ah Loh) came to Sri Bertam by boat after paddling up Sungai Bekok.<ref name=\"rogertan\"/> They then built three houses at the present Government Clinic compound.<ref name=\"rogertan\"/> Later he and his men with the help of his Malay friends began to clear some thick forests around the river banks. When this small settlement prospered and progressed, Boo named the place Yong Peng or Everlasting Peace in Chinese.<ref name=\"rogertan\"/>\n\nBoo ruled Yong Peng according to the \u2018Kangchu\u2019 or headman system where the Chinese word \"Kang\u201d means river while \"Chu\" means house. But essentially, \"Chu\" is the clan name of the first headman in charge of the plantations in the area.\n\nWhen more Chinese of other dialects began moving to Yong Peng, the settlement was also expanded further up the river, opening up two more areas - one was Mah Kau Kang and the other one was Seng Kang (now Kangkar Bahru).\n\nDuring this time, Sungai Bekok river was navigable by small ocean-going steamers. Local produce such as pepper and gambir were transported by boat to Batu Pahat and some to as far as Singapore; the whole journey taking about 16 days.\n\nKangchu Boo would also give a yearly report of Yong Peng to Sultan Abu Bakar. In order to keep law and order, one Malay by the name of Ismail was appointed the policeman of Yong Peng. Minor offences were dealt with by Kangchu Boo whilst more serious ones were sent to the magistrate\u2019s court in Batu Pahat.\n\nKangchu Boo died in 1907 at the age of 76. His body was buried in Tang Hak (old name for Jalan Masjid). It is around Jalan Ann Peng. After his death, his son Kangchu Boo Koh Soon Meng took over at the young age of 25. He ruled for about 35 years until his death in 1942. As he did not have a son, the Kangchu system also began to decline and it was also in the same year Yong Peng was conquered by the Japanese.\n\n=== Emergency Period ===\nAfter World War II, the British returned to power.  However, conflict with the [[Communist Party of Malaya]], their former ally during the Japanese occupation, emerged.  In 1950, in order to contain the communist insurgency, the British instituted as part of [[Briggs Plan]] the policy of forced relocation of large number of people and moved them into specially created settlements called \"[[New Village]]s\". This strategy was to prevent Communist sympathisers from supporting and supplying food to the insurgents. These camps were surrounded by barb wires and guarded day and night. Other than night curfews, residents of the camp were also strictly prohibited from carrying additional food or tools in or out of the camp. Curfews would commence at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and ended at 6 the next morning.  In Yong Peng, a few thousand squatters who were living and cultivating along isolated jungle fringes were thus resettled in the new village.\n\nSo, Jalan Templer in Yong Peng was named after the then British High Commissioner General Gerald Templer who was known for making this famous remark, \"The answer [to the uprising] lies not in pouring more troops into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of the people.\" (Lapping, 224) In order to win the hearts and minds of these new villagers at this time, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, also visited Yong Peng and opened the Yong Peng Chinese High School.\n\nIn 1952 when the local council of Yong Peng was established, Jalan Ah Loh was named in memory of Kangchu Boo Koh Ah Loh \uff08\u5deb\u8bb8\u4e9a\u9c81\uff09.\n\nYong Peng was also disturbed by the racial riots (mostly took place in [[Kuala Lumpur]]) during the May 13 event in 1969. Luckily, the Chinese Penghulu (Head Villager) from Yong Peng and the Malay Penghulus from the surrounding Kampungs had a relatively good relationship; and working together they cobbled several arrangements that help prevent the severe bloodshed seen in other urban areas.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s, the town was again affected by gang fights among rival gangster groups which usually took place at night outside the only cinema in Yong Peng at Jalan Templer. Peace was again restored when ASP Mokhtaruddin Yunus, dubbed by the locals as \u2018[[Bao Zheng|Justice Pao]]\u2019 was sent to Yong Peng. Within weeks, he was able to maintain law and order and until today many locals still remember him fondly as a strict and incorruptible policeman who came to save Yong Peng.\n\nToday most of these Chinese around are now in the fourth generation and have been thoroughly integrated as part of the Malaysian society.<ref name=\"rogertan\"/><ref name=\"rogertan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogertan.com/2007/11/best-place-to-be-on-earth.html|work= New Straits Times|date=7 November 2007|first=Roger|last=Tan Kor Mee|authorlink=Roger Tan Kor Mee|title=The best place to be on earth|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Yong Peng District Council.jpg|thumb|Yong Peng District Council]]\n[[File:Districts and PBT of Johor.svg|thumb|Administrative map of Yong Peng District Council in Johor]]\n\nIt is administered by the Yong Peng District Council (''Majlis Daerah Yong Peng'' (MDYP)), previously known as ''Eastern Batu Pahat District Council''. The district council is autonomous from [[Batu Pahat town|downtown Batu Pahat]] and it administers Yong Peng town and the adjacent neighbourhoods of [[Ayer Hitam (federal constituency)|Ayer Hitam]] and Tanjung Sembrong. It was established on 1 September 1979.\n\n== Politics ==\nYong Peng has its own constituency in the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly]], currently held by Chew Peck Choo of the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ahli Dewan Undangan Negeri Johor|url=http://dapmalaysia.org/parti/wakil-rakyat/ahli-dewan-undangan-negeri/johor/|website=DAPMalaysia.org|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the federal level Yong Peng is part of the [[Ayer Hitam]] parliamentary constituency. It is currently represented by [[Wee Ka Siong]] of the [[Barisan Nasional]] opposition coalition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ahli Parlimen|url=http://www.parlimen.gov.my/profile-ahli.html?uweb=dr&id=3154|website=Portal Rasmi Parlimen Malaysia|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nSlightly more than half of the local residents are of Chinese origin, whose forefathers migrated from southern China in the 1880s. The rest are Malays and Indians who mainly reside in the surrounding Yong Peng areas. Other than Malay, the other main language used is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] with an accent strongly influenced by the Fuzhou and [[Southern Min|Hokkien]] Dialects. Chinese make up the majority of the population at 60%, followed by the Malays at 32%, Indians at 7%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://undi.info/johor/n/P148-N19|title=undi.info|website=undi.info|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIndustrial areas in Yong Peng are Ayer Hitam, Ayer Hitam-Yong Peng Street, Yong Peng Town and Seri Wangi Industrial Areas.<ref>http://jpbd.johor.gov.my/images/jpbd_DokumenTerbitan/Handbook.pdf</ref>\n\n==Education==\nPrimary School - Yong Peng has One Chinese and two Government run National School (schools where Malay is the primary medium) - [[Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Bertam]] and Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Yong Peng (SRKYP). SRKYP was the smallest of the three primary school. It was originally part of a missionary school (Anglican Church) with an emphasis on the use of English as a teaching medium.  As a result, the students and teachers there have been known to be relatively more well verse in the use of English.  Not long after independence, it was converted to a National School where the Malay language is used as the primary medium instead.\n\nSecondary School - Yong Peng has one Chinese Independent school (Yong Peng High School); and two government run National schools - Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Yong Peng (SMYP) & SMK Dato' Seth. SMYP was the biggest of the three.  It has students from all the three primary schools in Yong Peng and also from the surrounding areas such as Lam Lee, Kangkar Baru, Parit Yanni and even as far as Sri Medan.\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:HockChew-SquareBread (Single).jpg|thumb|right|Fuzhou-style bread]]\n\nYong Peng is known for its [[Fuzhou]] (\u798f\u5dde) style cuisine. This would include HockChew Chow Mien (handmade noodles that are first boiled, then stir fried); HockChew Egg Soup; HockChew FishBall (one of the bounciest fishballs; with fish on the outside and pork on the inside); Fermented Red Rice Wine Chicken; Fermented Red Rice Wine Noodles; HockChew Square Bread (typically pork fat or meat is added as filling); and HockChew plain bread (also known as [[Yong Peng bread]] - round shaped yeast bread that is available as plain with sesame seed, sweet or salted; no fillings within). The aforesaid are all classically unique food only available in Yong Peng.\n\nOf course, there are other nice adapted Chinese food too. The \"Duck Noodle\" near Tian Hou Gong temple, Laksa (served in Thai style where you could choose to add your own curry & chili powder) near the old cinema), Lu Mien (dark noodles cooked with black vinegar) near the Eastern Garden, Fish Ball & Fish Cakes from Yuen Yuen restaurant are some of the old favorites. Even some of the stalls in Jalan Meng Seng, near the Pasar served pretty good food too.\n\nEven muar famous handmade food, otak otak is now can be found in yong peng from a newly set out outlet, AH JIE otak otak opposite the RONG CHENG restaurant. AH JIE otak shop is famous with handmade otak otak in frozen packet, seremban SiewBao, pineapple tart, Matisu, popiah otak, setiawan misua, TAN KIM HOCK product.\n\nThere is plenty of local Malay and Indian food stalls (warung). One famous place is near the wet market, where people usually go for breakfast. It is famous for its nasi lemak, lontong and mee goreng (fried noodle, Malay stype). The Rendang, Kari Ekor (Ox Tail Soup) and Roti Canai are all wonderful additions to the local cuisine.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n* [[Fortune Dragon]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nYong Peng has two main interchanges on [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]] including [[Yong Peng North Interchange|north]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Yong Peng South Interchange|south]] to [[Johor Bahru]].

But essentially, \"Chu\" is the clan name of the first headman in charge of the plantations in the area.\n\nWhen more Chinese of other dialects began moving to Yong Peng, the settlement was also expanded further up the river, opening up two more areas - one was Mah Kau Kang and the other one was Seng Kang (now Kangkar Bahru).\n\nDuring this time, Sungai Bekok river was navigable by small ocean-going steamers. Local produce such as pepper and gambir were transported by boat to Batu Pahat and some to as far as Singapore; the whole journey taking about 16 days.\n\nKangchu Boo would also give a yearly report of Yong Peng to Sultan Abu Bakar. In order to keep law and order, one Malay by the name of Ismail was appointed the policeman of Yong Peng. Minor offences were dealt with by Kangchu Boo whilst more serious ones were sent to the magistrate\u2019s court in Batu Pahat.\n\nKangchu Boo died in 1907 at the age of 76. His body was buried in Tang Hak (old name for Jalan Masjid). It is around Jalan Ann Peng. After his death, his son Kangchu Boo Koh Soon Meng took over at the young age of 25. He ruled for about 35 years until his death in 1942. As he did not have a son, the Kangchu system also began to decline and it was also in the same year Yong Peng was conquered by the Japanese.\n\n=== Emergency Period ===\nAfter World War II, the British returned to power.  However, conflict with the [[Communist Party of Malaya]], their former ally during the Japanese occupation, emerged.  In 1950, in order to contain the communist insurgency, the British instituted as part of [[Briggs Plan]] the policy of forced relocation of large number of people and moved them into specially created settlements called \"[[New Village]]s\". This strategy was to prevent Communist sympathisers from supporting and supplying food to the insurgents. These camps were surrounded by barb wires and guarded day and night. Other than night curfews, residents of the camp were also strictly prohibited from carrying additional food or tools in or out of the camp. Curfews would commence at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and ended at 6 the next morning.  In Yong Peng, a few thousand squatters who were living and cultivating along isolated jungle fringes were thus resettled in the new village.\n\nSo, Jalan Templer in Yong Peng was named after the then British High Commissioner General Gerald Templer who was known for making this famous remark, \"The answer [to the uprising] lies not in pouring more troops into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of the people.\" (Lapping, 224) In order to win the hearts and minds of these new villagers at this time, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, also visited Yong Peng and opened the Yong Peng Chinese High School.\n\nIn 1952 when the local council of Yong Peng was established, Jalan Ah Loh was named in memory of Kangchu Boo Koh Ah Loh \uff08\u5deb\u8bb8\u4e9a\u9c81\uff09.\n\nYong Peng was also disturbed by the racial riots (mostly took place in [[Kuala Lumpur]]) during the May 13 event in 1969. Luckily, the Chinese Penghulu (Head Villager) from Yong Peng and the Malay Penghulus from the surrounding Kampungs had a relatively good relationship; and working together they cobbled several arrangements that help prevent the severe bloodshed seen in other urban areas.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s, the town was again affected by gang fights among rival gangster groups which usually took place at night outside the only cinema in Yong Peng at Jalan Templer. Peace was again restored when ASP Mokhtaruddin Yunus, dubbed by the locals as \u2018[[Bao Zheng|Justice Pao]]\u2019 was sent to Yong Peng. Within weeks, he was able to maintain law and order and until today many locals still remember him fondly as a strict and incorruptible policeman who came to save Yong Peng.\n\nToday most of these Chinese around are now in the fourth generation and have been thoroughly integrated as part of the Malaysian society.<ref name=\"rogertan\"/><ref name=\"rogertan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogertan.com/2007/11/best-place-to-be-on-earth.html|work= New Straits Times|date=7 November 2007|first=Roger|last=Tan Kor Mee|authorlink=Roger Tan Kor Mee|title=The best place to be on earth|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Yong Peng District Council.jpg|thumb|Yong Peng District Council]]\n[[File:Districts and PBT of Johor.svg|thumb|Administrative map of Yong Peng District Counil in Johor]]\n\nIt is administered by the Yong Peng District Council (''Majlis Daerah Yong Peng'' (MDYP)), previously known as ''Eastern Batu Pahat District Council''.

SRKYP was the smallest of the three primary school. It was originally part of a missionary school (Anglican Church) with an emphasis on the use of English as a teaching medium.  As a result, the students and teachers there have been known to be relatively more well verse in the use of English.  Not long after independence, it was converted to a National School where the Malay language is used as the primary medium instead.\n\nSecondary School - Yong Peng has one Chinese Independent school (Yong Peng High School); and two government run National schools - Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Yong Peng (SMYP) & SMK Dato' Seth. SMYP was the biggest of the three.  It has students from all the three primary schools in Yong Peng and also from the surrounding areas such as Lam Lee, Kangkar Baru, Parit Yanni and even as far as Sri Medan.\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:HockChew-SquareBread (Single).jpg|thumb|right|Fuzhou-style bread]]\n\nYong Peng is known for its [[Fuzhou]] (\u798f\u5dde) style cuisine.

The aforesaid are all classically unique food only available in Yong Peng.\n\nOf course, there are other nice adapted Chinese food too. The \"Duck Noodle\" near Tian Hou Gong temple, Laksa (served in Thai style where you could choose to add your own curry & chili powder) near the old cinema), Lu Mien (dark noodles cooked with black vinegar) near the Eastern Garden, Fish Ball & Fish Cakes from Yuen Yuen restaurant are some of the old favorites. Even some of the stalls in Jalan Meng Seng, near the Pasar served pretty good food too.\n\nEven muar famous handmade food, otak otak is now can be found in yong peng from a newly set out outlet, AH JIE otak otak opposite the RONG CHENG restaurant. AH JIE otak shop is famous with handmade otak otak in frozen packet, seremban SiewBao, pineapple tart, Matisu, popiah otak, setiawan misua, TAN KIM HOCK product.\n\nThere is plenty of local Malay and Indian food stalls (warung). One famous place is near the wet market, where people usually go for breakfast. It is famous for its nasi lemak, lontong and mee goreng (fried noodle, Malay stype). The Rendang, Kari Ekor (Ox Tail Soup) and Roti Canai are all wonderful additions to the local cuisine.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n* [[Fortune Dragon]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nYong Peng has two main interchanges on [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]] including [[Yong Peng North Interchange|north]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Yong Peng South Interchange|south]] to [[Johor Bahru]].

The project was deemed a low priority and was shelved. US&nbsp;51, which ran mostly down the middle of the state, became a heavily traveled two-lane arterial road, experiencing many crashes and earning the nickname \"Killer&nbsp;51\".\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30&nbsp;minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 412, was a route that would extend from US&nbsp;20 in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] to I-57 just north of Salem, similar to the earlier requested route. Due to traffic counts, only the portion between Rockford and [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] was prioritized.<ref name=\"interstate_39 decatur\">{{cite maps |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation |url= http://www.midwestroads.com/illinois/il%20supp%20fwy.pdf |format= PDF |title= Priority Primary Routes |date= April 12, 1978 |accessdate= March 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eb72at39a.jpg|thumb|right|Ramp stub on I-72 in Decatur where I-39 was to connect]]\nOver the course of the 1970s, planning for the US&nbsp;51 supplemental freeway (officially known as the North\u2013South Freeway) took place in earnest.

About {{convert|55|mi|km|0}} north of the city, I-39 crosses the [[Illinois River]] over the [[Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge]], which is {{convert|2170.8|m|mi|1}} long.<ref name=national_bridges>{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com/index.php?option=com_lqm&b1849fc92c286e5b5ed0fbf618d953ae=1&task=showResults&query=8&lqm_id=169862&&format=raw&&Itemid=2 |title=Structure 000050019120847 |author= Federal Highway Administration |work= [[National Bridge Inventory]] |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |accessdate= June 1, 2012}}</ref> Just north of the Illinois River, I-39 runs east of the cities of [[LaSalle, Illinois|LaSalle]] and [[Peru, Illinois|Peru]] before intersecting [[Interstate 80 in Illinois|Interstate 80]]. North of I-80, the wind turbines of the [[Mendota Hills Wind Farm]] can be seen from milepost 72 at [[Mendota, Illinois|Mendota]] north to near [[Paw Paw, Illinois|Paw Paw]]. I-39 intersects with [[Interstate 88 (Illinois)|I-88]] near [[Rochelle, Illinois|Rochelle]]. Further north, I-39 crosses the [[Kishwaukee River]] before meeting [[U. S. Route 20|US 20]] on the south side of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]. I-39 then runs east concurrently with US 20 to where the interstate joins the [[Jane Addams Memorial Tollway]] and [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|Interstate 90]] near [[Cherry Valley, Illinois|Cherry Valley]]. I-39 and I-90 head north together to [[South Beloit, Illinois|South Beloit]]. There is a toll plaza just south of Rockton Road. US&nbsp;51 leaves I-39/90 at [[Illinois 75]] in South Beloit, while I-39/90 continue north into Wisconsin.\n\nFor all but {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} that Interstate 39 is in Illinois, it is designated concurrently with U.S. Route 51. The southern terminus of I-39 is less than {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} from [[Interstate 74 in Illinois|Interstate 74]] as it runs around Normal.\n\n=== Wisconsin ===\n[[File:Interstate39NorthernWisconsinForest.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 39, along with US&nbsp;51, in northern Wisconsin]]\nI-39 enters from Illinois along with I-90, passing under Stateline Road (Hwy P), and bypasses Beloit to the east. East of the town, the route has a cloverleaf interchange that serves as the terminus for both [[Wisconsin Highway 81|WIS 81]]\u2014which heads westward into Beloit\u2014and [[Interstate 43|I-43]], which provides access to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. I-39/I-90 has 3 interchanges (including one in Illinois) that serves Beloit. The I-39/90 concurrency continues to the north and is joined by [[Wisconsin Highway 11|WIS 11]] about {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the I-43 interchange. The route bypasses [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]] to the east, although interchanges with [[U.S. Route 14 in Wisconsin|US 14]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 26|WIS 26]] provide access to the town. There are 4 exits that serve Janesville. The route continues generally to the north, crossing the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] before having an interchange with [[Wisconsin Highway 59|WIS 59]] that provides access to [[Edgerton, Wisconsin|Edgerton]] to the west.<ref name=\"wisdot13\">{{cite WisDOT map|year= 2013}}</ref> Subsequently, the route enters [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] as it passes west of [[Lake Koshkonong]]. It is joined by US 51 from Edgerton and serves as the southern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 73|WIS 73]]. US 51 leaves the route {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north, about {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Stoughton, Wisconsin|Stoughton]]. The Interstate gradually turns westward around [[Utica, Dane County, Wisconsin|Utica]] to an interchange with CTH N. It then turns gradually back to the north and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|US 12]] and [[U.S. Route 18 in Wisconsin|US 18]] in Madison. I-39 and I-90 bypass Madison to the east, and I-94 joins the concurrency at the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 30|WIS 30]], an interchange known as the Badger Interchange.<ref name=\"wisdot_badger_int\">{{cite press release|first= Jim |last= Buschkopf |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/opencms/export/nr/modules/news/news_0396.html_786229440.html |title= I-94 reconstruction to be discussed September 19 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080827230235/http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/opencms/export/nr/modules/news/news_0396.html_786229440.html |archivedate= August 27, 2008}}</ref> About {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north, the highway crosses [[U.S. Route 151 in Wisconsin|US 151]], which includes a south-side access to High Crossing Boulevard.

The highway crosses the [[Wisconsin River]] {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} north of CTH CS. At {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} further along the route from the river, I-39 leaves the concurrency with I-90 and I-94 and turns northward while the other two interstates turn northwest. [[Wisconsin Highway 78|WIS 78]] terminates at this interchange and heads southwest. This is the starting point of the segment of freeway that carries the I-39 route alone. The interstate crosses [[Wisconsin Highway 33|WIS 33]], the first of 3 interchanges accessing Portage, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} north of I-90/I-94. After crossing the Wisconsin River again, I-39 crosses the second interchange\u2014this one with [[Wisconsin Highway 16|WIS 16]] and turns northeast to an interchange with US 51. The US route joins the Interstate and both turn north once again and leave the Portage area and, after {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}}, enter [[Marquette County, Wisconsin|Marquette County]].<ref name=\"wisdot13\"/>\n\n[[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS 23]] joins I-39/US 51 northbound, {{convert|4|mi|km}} from the county line. The three highways pass along Buffalo Lake and encounter a south-side half interchange with CTH D in the town of [[Packwaukee, Wisconsin|Packwaukee]]. WIS 23 leave the concurrency to the east heading toward [[Montello, Wisconsin|Montello]] at [[Wisconsin Highway 82|WIS 82]] near [[Oxford, Wisconsin|Oxford]]. and the freeway takes a due north route to pass [[Westfield, Wisconsin|Westfield]].

The WIS 54 interchange and the CTH B interchange a mile and a half north of it provide access for [[Plover, Wisconsin|Plover]]. The next four interchanges\u2014CTH HH, [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US 10]] Eastbound / [[Wisconsin Highway 66|WIS 66]] Westbound, Stanley Street and Business US 51 provide access to [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]]. Amongst these interchanges, the freeway turns northwestward, bypassing the city to the east and north.

The project was deemed a low priority and was shelved. US&nbsp;51, which ran mostly down the middle of the state, became a heavily traveled two-lane arterial road, experiencing many crashes and earning the nickname \"Killer&nbsp;51\".\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30&nbsp;minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 412, was a route that would extend from US&nbsp;20 in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] to I-57 just north of Salem, similar to the earlier requested route. Due to traffic counts, only the portion between Rockford and [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] was prioritized.<ref name=\"interstate_39 decatur\">{{cite maps |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation |url= http://www.midwestroads.com/illinois/il%20supp%20fwy.pdf |format= PDF |title= Priority Primary Routes |date= April 12, 1978 |accessdate= March 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eb72at39a.jpg|thumb|right|Ramp stub on I-72 in Decatur where I-39 was to connect]]\nOver the course of the 1970s, planning for the US&nbsp;51 supplemental freeway (officially known as the North\u2013South Freeway) took place in earnest.
