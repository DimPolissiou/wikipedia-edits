The development of the first game was originally based on an idea that [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] had of making a video game starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], but as that idea fell through, a [[fantasy]]-themed [[fighting game]] titled ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' was created instead. ''Mortal Kombat'' was the first ever fighting game to introduce a secret fighter, reached if the player fulfilled a set of requirements. The original game has spawned [[List of Mortal Kombat media|many sequels and spin-offs]] consisting of several [[action-adventure game]]s, as well as a comic book series and a card game. Film producer [[Lawrence Kasanoff]] licensed the rights to the game in the early 1990s and produced the first hit movie ever made from a video game. Lawrence also produced the second movie, animated TV series, live-action TV series films, the first one million platinum-selling album and a live-action tour. ''Mortal Kombat'' has become the most successful fighting franchise in the history of video games and one of the [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].\n\nThe series has a reputation for high levels of violent content, including, most notably, its [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] (finishing moves allowing the player to finish off their defeated opponent). [[Controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat|Controversies surrounding ''Mortal Kombat'']], in part, led to the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] video game rating system. Early games in this series were also noted for their realistic [[digitization|digitized]] [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and an extensive use of [[palette swap]]ping to create new characters. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the ''Mortal Kombat'' development team was acquired by [[Warner Bros.]] and turned into [[NetherRealm Studios]]. [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] currently owns the rights to the franchise, which it [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed in 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Further|Fighting game}}\n\n[[File:Mortal Kombat II arcade cabinet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' arcade cabinet's control board]]\n\nThe original three games and their updates, ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993), ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1995), ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1995), and ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' (1996), were styled in a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] fighting fashion. The first two of them were played in the [[Arcade game|arcades]] with a [[joystick]] and five buttons: high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick, and block. ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and its updates added a sixth \"run\" button.<ref name=\"history\" /> Characters in the early ''Mortal Kombat'' games play virtually identically to one another, with the only major differences being their special moves.<ref>{{cite web|title=1UP Show: Mortal Kombat vs. DCU Impressions|url=http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/22707|date=November 21, 2008|website=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=April 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061209/http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/22707|archivedate=July 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Through the 1990s, the developer and publisher [[Midway Games]] would keep their single styled fighting moves with four attack buttons for a different array of punches, kicks and blocks. ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'' \nwas the first Mortal Kombat game which the character could move 3D like. Mortal Kombat 4 also tried to introduce the 3D system but it wasn't worked properly due to old system mechanics. Also the combination of the moves changed from the old Mortal Kombat games and this was done by differentiating characters' normal moves and even giving them multiple fighting styles.

The ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' manual described six of the realms as: \"Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage and Jax, and also under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshipped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"MKD booklet\">{{Cite journal |title=Mortal Kombat Deception Instruction Booklet |year= 2004 |publisher= Midway Amusement Game, LLC |page= 15 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name=\"mkdk\">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 4, 2004 |level= Konquehh |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref> The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments.\n\nThe [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|first ''Mortal Kombat'' game]] takes place in Earthrealm (Earth) where seven different warriors with their own reasons for entering participated in the tournament with the eventual prize being the continued freedom of their realm, threatened with a takeover by Outworld. Among the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. With the help of the thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 2]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1994 |level=Opening sequence}}</ref> In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung's failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where Liu Kang eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By the time of ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by Liu Kang again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The following game, ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by Liu Kang.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', the evil sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces to conquer the realms. By ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile at the end of ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'',<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=November 20, 2002 |level=Reptile ending |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu,<ref name=\"mkdk\" /> the source of Onaga's power.

Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces.

Centuries before the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Queen Delia foretold the realms would be destroyed because the power of all warriors from all the realms would rise to such greatness it would overwhelm and destabilize the realms, triggering an all-destructive chain of events. King Argus had his sons, Taven and Daegon, have been put into incubation and who would one day be awakened to save the realms from Armageddon by defeating a firespawn known as [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat)|Blaze]]. In the end, however, Shao Kahn is the one who defeats Blaze, causing Armageddon.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=Konquest |accessdate=November 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe crossover ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' does not seem to share continuity with any of the other games. After the simultaneous defeats of both Shao Kahn and the alien warlord [[Darkseid]] in the [[DC Universe]] cause both villains to fuse into the entity \"Dark Kahn\", both the ''Mortal Kombat'' and DC Universes begin to merge. This causes the warriors and heroes to undergo bouts of uncontrollable rage and attack anyone on sight. The heroes and villains of both universes repeatedly conflict with each other, believing each other to be responsible for the catastrophe, until only Raiden and [[Superman]] remain. The two confront Dark Kahn and both realize that the other is not working for him, and team up to defeat their common foe. After Dark Kahn's defeat, the two realms unfuse, with Shao Kahn and Darkseid trapped in each other's different reality and facing eternal imprisonment.\n\nIn [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'']] (2011), it is revealed that the battle between the warriors of the six realms in ''Armageddon'' culminated into only two survivors: Shao Kahn and Raiden. Badly beaten, Raiden had only one last move he could make to prevent Shao Kahn from claiming the power of Blaze. He sends last-ditch visions of the entire course of the ''Mortal Kombat'' timeline to himself in the past right before the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament (first game). This transfer of information to his former self causes a rift in time, causing a new \"reboot\" timeline to be introduced that splits off from the original ''Armageddon'' timeline, with a new outcome of Mortal Kombat history to be written. But this story leads to even worse unforeseen events. It ends with many of the main game characters dying at the hands of Queen Sindel and Raiden accidentally killing Liu Kang in self-defense. Eventually, the Elder Gods aid Raiden in killing Shao Kahn and saving Earthrealm. But as the scene goes on it is later revealed that this was all a plan by Shinnok and Quan Chi.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' sees Shinnok and Quan Chi enacting their plan, leading an army of undead revenants of those that were killed in Shao Kahn's invasion against the realms. A team of warriors led by Raiden, Johnny Cage, Kenshi Takahashi and Sonya Blade oppose Shinnok, and in the ensuing battle, Shinnok is imprisoned, Quan Chi escapes and various warriors are resurrected and freed from Shinnok's thrall. Twenty-five years later, Quan Chi resurfaces and allies himself with the insectoid D'Vorah in manipulating events that lead to Shinnok's release. Though Quan Chi is killed by a vengeful Scorpion in the process, Shinnok resumes his assault against the realms. After a grueling, protracted battle, Shinnok is defeated by Cassandra Cage representing the next generation of Earthrealm's warriors. With both Quan Chi and Shinnok gone, the undead revenants of Liu Kang and Kitana assume control of the Netherrealm and Lord Raiden now seeks to violently and preemptively protect Earthrealm from any perceived threat, throwing the severed head of Shinnok at the feet of Kitana and Liu Kang as a warning.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' sees the architect of time and Shinnok's Mother, Kronika to restart the timeline after her son's decapitation, where it turns out that said beheading tampered with the balance between Light and Darkness courtesy of the now-corrupted Raiden. After the death of Sonya Blade & the destruction of the Cathedral of Shinnok in the Netherrealm, Liu Kang and Kitana make a partnership with Kronika herself to commence to rewrite history with her hourglass in her Keep in the Netherrealm. Starting with a timequake that brought past versions of the likes of Shao Kahn, Liu Kang, Kitana, Kung Lao, Jade, Skarlet and Baraka to the present as well as erasing Dark Raiden from existence leaving his past self to exist alone in the present due to his Immortal status. After the past Raiden and Liu Kang fight with each other, Raiden came to realize that his battle with Liu Kang is part of Kronika's machinations to have them fight to the death which occurred in alternate timelines. Knowing their combined strength can put a stop to Kronika. With Kronika now defeated and far into the past without any chance of restoring the present, the now-Fire God Liu Kang took advice from a now-mortal Raiden as he starts a new timeline from the dawn of time with the help of Kitana, hoping that their work together can shape a better future and hopes of seeing Raiden the elder god again in the next timeline.\n\n==Development history==\n{{Timeline of

The development of the first game was originally based on an idea that [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] had of making a video game starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], but as that idea fell through, a [[fantasy]]-themed [[fighting game]] titled ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' was created instead. ''Mortal Kombat'' was the first ever fighting game to introduce a secret fighter, reached if the player fulfilled a set of requirements. The original game has spawned [[List of Mortal Kombat media|many sequels and spin-offs]] consisting of several [[action-adventure game]]s, as well as a comic book series and a card game. Film producer [[Lawrence Kasanoff]] licensed the rights to the game in the early 1990s and produced the first hit movie ever made from a video game. Lawrence also produced the second movie, animated TV series, live-action TV series films, the first one million platinum-selling album and a live-action tour. ''Mortal Kombat'' has become the most successful fighting franchise in the history of video games and one of the [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].\n\nThe series has a reputation for high levels of violent content, including, most notably, its [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] (finishing moves allowing the player to finish off their defeated opponent). [[Controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat|Controversies surrounding ''Mortal Kombat'']], in part, led to the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] video game rating system. Early games in this series were also noted for their realistic [[digitization|digitized]] [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and an extensive use of [[palette swap]]ping to create new characters. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the ''Mortal Kombat'' development team was acquired by [[Warner Bros.]] and turned into [[NetherRealm Studios]]. [[Warner Bros.

An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit at the end of the fight.<ref name=history2/> The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.<ref name=history/><ref name=\"MK3\">{{cite web|author=Gertsmann, Jeff |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ultimatemortalkombat3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review |title=Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Review |website=GameSpot |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071814/https://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ultimatemortalkombat3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary%3Bread-review |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOther finishing moves in the various ''Mortal Kombat'' games include Animalities (introduced in ''Mortal Kombat 3'') turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent;<ref name=\"GameSpotMK3\"/> Brutality (introduced in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'') which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original ''Mortal Kombat'' Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below, and later made more difficult in ''Mortal Kombat II'' by requiring specific and different button sequences to be pressed) utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' added the [[Seppuku|Hara-Kiri]], a self-Fatality allowing the losers to engage in a suicidal finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).<ref name=history2>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=\"The History of Fatalities\" commentary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Kasavin |title=Mortal Kombat: Deception (Xbox) Review |date=October 4, 2004 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/mortalkombatdeception/review.html |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414174415/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/mortalkombatdeception/review.html |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also some non-violent finishing moves in the series.

Among the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. With the help of the thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 2]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1994 |level=Opening sequence}}</ref> In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung's failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where Liu Kang eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By the time of ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by Liu Kang again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The following game, ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by Liu Kang.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', the evil sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces to conquer the realms. By ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile at the end of ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'',<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=November 20, 2002 |level=Reptile ending |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu,<ref name=\"mkdk\" /> the source of Onaga's power.

Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces.

Centuries before the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Queen Delia foretold the realms would be destroyed because the power of all warriors from all the realms would rise to such greatness it would overwhelm and destabilize the realms, triggering an all-destructive chain of events. King Argus had his sons, Taven and Daegon, have been put into incubation and who would one day be awakened to save the realms from Armageddon by defeating a firespawn known as [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat)|Blaze]]. In the end, however, Shao Kahn is the one who defeats Blaze, causing Armageddon.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=Konquest |accessdate=November 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe crossover ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' does not seem to share continuity with any of the other games. After the simultaneous defeats of both Shao Kahn and the alien warlord [[Darkseid]] in the [[DC Universe]] cause both villains to fuse into the entity \"Dark Kahn\", both the ''Mortal Kombat'' and DC Universes begin to merge. This causes the warriors and heroes to undergo bouts of uncontrollable rage and attack anyone on sight. The heroes and villains of both universes repeatedly conflict with each other, believing each other to be responsible for the catastrophe, until only Raiden and [[Superman]] remain. The two confront Dark Kahn and both realize that the other is not working for him, and team up to defeat their common foe. After Dark Kahn's defeat, the two realms unfuse, with Shao Kahn and Darkseid trapped in each other's different reality and facing eternal imprisonment.\n\nIn [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'']] (2011), it is revealed that the battle between the warriors of the six realms in ''Armageddon'' culminated into only two survivors: Shao Kahn and Raiden. Badly beaten, Raiden had only one last move he could make to prevent Shao Kahn from claiming the power of Blaze. He sends last-ditch visions of the entire course of the ''Mortal Kombat'' timeline to himself in the past right before the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament (first game). This transfer of information to his former self causes a rift in time, causing a new \"reboot\" timeline to be introduced that splits off from the original ''Armageddon'' timeline, with a new outcome of Mortal Kombat history to be written. But this story leads to even worse unforeseen events. It ends with many of the main game characters dying at the hands of Queen Sindel and Raiden accidentally killing Liu Kang in self-defense. Eventually, the Elder Gods aid Raiden in killing Shao Kahn and saving Earthrealm. But as the scene goes on it is later revealed that this was all a plan by Shinnok and Quan Chi.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' sees Shinnok and Quan Chi enacting their plan, leading an army of undead revenants of those that were killed in Shao Kahn's invasion against the realms. A team of warriors led by Raiden, Johnny Cage, Kenshi Takahashi and Sonya Blade oppose Shinnok, and in the ensuing battle, Shinnok is imprisoned, Quan Chi escapes and various warriors are resurrected and freed from Shinnok's thrall. Twenty-five years later, Quan Chi resurfaces and allies himself with the insectoid D'Vorah in manipulating events that lead to Shinnok's release. Though Quan Chi is killed by a vengeful Scorpion in the process, Shinnok resumes his assault against the realms. After a grueling, protracted battle, Shinnok is defeated by Cassandra Cage representing the next generation of Earthrealm's warriors. With both Quan Chi and Shinnok gone, the undead revenants of Liu Kang and Kitana assume control of the Netherrealm and Lord Raiden now seeks to violently and preemptively protect Earthrealm from any perceived threat, throwing the severed head of Shinnok at the feet of Kitana and Liu Kang as a warning.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' sees the architect of time and Shinnok's Mother, Kronika to restart the timeline after her son's decapitation, where it turns out that said beheading tampered with the balance between Light and Darkness courtesy of the now-corrupted Raiden. After the death of Sonya Blade & the destruction of the Cathedral of Shinnok in the Netherrealm, Liu Kang and Kitana make a partnership with Kronika herself to commence to rewrite history with her hourglass in her Keep in the Netherrealm. Starting with a timequake that brought past versions of the likes of Shao Kahn, Liu Kang, Kitana, Kung Lao, Jade, Skarlet and Baraka to the present as well as erasing Dark Raiden from existence leaving his past self to exist alone in the present due to his Immortal status. After the past Raiden and Liu Kang fight with each other, Raiden came to realize that his battle with Liu Kang is part of Kronika's machinations to have them fight to the death which occurred in alternate timelines. Knowing their combined strength can put a stop to Kronika. With Kronika now defeated and far into the past without any chance of restoring the present, the now-Fire God Liu Kang took advice from a now-mortal Raiden as he starts a new timeline from the dawn of time with the help of Kitana, hoping that their work together can shape a better future and hopes of seeing Raiden the elder god again in the next timeline.\n\n==Development history==\n{{Timeline of

When in tenth grade, Hull was moved to starting tight-end, and defensive end.  In his junior year, as the Falcon team began its first year of varsity football, Hull was moved to tailback by Head Coach Gary Hess, in the Falcon's single-wing offense.  He returned the opening kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown the first time he touched the ball in a varsity regular season game and gained 142 yards rushing on just ten carries, not including his kickoff return.\n\nIn his senior year at CVHS Hull earned First Team All-League honors, amassing over 1,000 yards total offense.

Between his sophomore year blocking for Heisman Trophy winner, Mike Garrett, and his senior year blocking for future Heisman winner [[OJ Simpson]], Hull led the USC Rose Bowl team in rushing avg. with 6.7 yds. per carry, winning the \"Roy Bullet Baker\" award as the Trojans' Most Valuable back. He was also selected as the Most Valuable Player in the USC vs. UCLA game, while rushing for 147 yds on 14 carries against the Bruins.\n\n===Professional career===\nHull was drafted in the first round of the [[1968 NFL draft]] by the [[Chicago Bears]], the 16th player selected.  He played for the Bears for three years, suffering through the Brian Piccolo tragedy, though helping All Pro and future Hall of Famer [[Gale Sayers]], as the lead blocker.\n\nIn 1971 Hull was traded to the Washington Redskins for three players, joining coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]]'s \"Over-the-Hill-Gang\".  He played in 86 consecutive games with the Redskins over five NFL seasons, six NFL playoff games, the NFL Championship and the Super Bowl, where he was a Special Teams leader.\n\n==Law career==\nAfter seven years in the NFL, Hull started his law school education at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in Washington, D.C., earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1979.  He became an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the [[District of Columbia]], and then became an Assistant US Attorney for the US, a prosecutor for the United States.  He met his wife Connie, then a lawyer representing the NFL, married and had a daughter, Michelle. After 20 years in the East as a professional football player, law student and lawyer, he moved back with Connie and Michelle to Southern California, where his son, Thomas, was born. His other son, Ernie, from a prior marriage, graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, has his Masters from [[Pepperdine University]].\n\nMike now resides in San Clemente, California, with wife Connie and their daughter Michelle, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and from Columbia Law School, in New York.\n\n{{1968 NFL Draft}}\n{{BearsFirstPick}}\n{{Bears1968DraftPicks}}\n{{1967 USC football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hull, Mike}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Washington Redskins players]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from California]]\n[[Category:People from La Crescenta-Montrose, California]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=December 2012}}\n{{No footnotes|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n{{Infobox gridiron football person\n| name = \n| image = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1945|11|2|mf=y}}\n| birth_place = [[La Crescenta, California]]\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| team = \n| number = 23,33, 25\n| status = \n| position1 = [[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n| height_ft = \n| height_in = \n| weight_lb = \n| college = [[University of Southern California|Southern California]]\n| NFLDraftedYear = 1968\n| NFLDraftedRound = 1\n| NFLDraftedPick = 16\n| NFLDraftedTeam = \n| playing_years1 = 1968\u20131970\n| playing_team1 = [[Chicago Bears]]\n| playing_years2 = 1971\u20131974\n| playing_team2 = [[Washington Redskins]]\n| career_highlights = \n| NFL = HUL207644\n| DatabaseFootball = HULLMIK01\n}}\n'''Michael Bruce Hull''' (born April 2, 1945) is a retired [[American football]] [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] that played in the [[National Football League]].

He played for the Bears for three years, suffering through the Brian Piccolo tragedy, though helping All Pro and future Hall of Famer [[Gale Sayers]], as the lead blocker.\n\nIn 1971 Hull was traded to the Washington Redskins for three players, joining coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]]'s \"Over-the-Hill-Gang\".  He played in 86 consecutive games with the Redskins over five NFL seasons, six NFL playoff games, the NFL Championship and the Super Bowl, where he was a Special Teams leader.\n\n==Law career==\nAfter seven years in the NFL, Hull started his law school education at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in Washington, D.C., earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1979.  He became an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the [[District of Columbia]], and then became an Assistant US Attorney for the US, a prosecutor for the United States.  He met his wife Connie, then a lawyer representing the NFL, married and had a daughter, Michelle. After 20 years in the East as a professional football player, law student and lawyer, he moved back with Connie and Michelle to Southern California, where his son, Thomas, was born. His other son, Ernie, from a prior marriage, graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, has his Masters from [[Pepperdine University]].\n\nMike now resides in San Clemente, California, with wife Connie and their daughter Michelle, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and from Columbia Law School, in New York.\n\n{{1968 NFL Draft}}\n{{BearsFirstPick}}\n{{Bears1968DraftPicks}}\n{{1967 USC football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hull, Mike}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Washington Redskins players]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from California]]\n[[Category:People from La Crescenta-Montrose, California]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography:replaced: Student Body President \u2192 student body president", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hull_(fullback)"}

The council, commonly known on campus as the '''SSC''', considers matters in which the interests, rights, or responsibilities of students are involved and brings concerns to the attention of the NYU administration and to the University Senate.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nStudent government at NYU begins at the school level. Each school or college has its own student council. Student council presidents come together with the elected and appointed Student Senators from each school to form the SSC's largest [[committee]], University Committee on Student Life, which makes recommendations to the Student Senators Council.\n\nThe SSC is made up of 23 Student Senators elected by the students of the various schools and colleges of NYU and 12 Student Senators appointed [[at-large]] by the Executive Committee of the University Senate with the advice and consent of the elected Student Senators.\n\nThe executive committee of the SSC and UCSL consists of the SSC Vice Chairperson, the UCSL Vice Chairperson, the Global Vice Chairperson, and the SSC/UCSL Chairperson elected.  The executive committee is elected by the 23 elected Student Senators for a one-year term at the last SSC meeting of the [[academic year]].\n\nIn 2017, as directed by student body president Juan Calero, the Student Senators Council was vastly reformed along with the rest of NYU's student governance system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyunews.com/2017/10/03/nyus-student-government-overhaul-explained/|title=NYU\u2019s Student Government Overhaul, Explained|last=Devlin|first=Sayer|work=Washington Square News|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The chief body would now become the Student Government Assembly (SGA), open to the public and tasked with primary deliberations of the broader student body.
