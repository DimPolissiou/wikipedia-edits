Before the 20th century, the tiny settlement was concentrated around in what was Kenton Lane (the easternmost part of which remains as Old Kenton Lane to the east of Kingsbury station) and is now part of the present day Woodgrange Avenue and Kenton Road.<ref>Ordnance Survey maps, various, from 19th century to 1930s</ref>\n\n[[Windermere, South Kenton|The Windermere]] is a [[listed building|Grade II listed]] [[public house]] in Windermere Avenue.<ref name=EnglishHeritage>{{NHLE|desc=The Windermere public house|num=1350348|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> It is on the [[Campaign for Real Ale]]'s [[National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]]<ref name=Brandwood>{{cite book|last1=Brandwood|first1=Geoff|title=Britain's best real heritage pubs|date=2013|publisher=CAMRA|location=St. Albans|isbn=9781852493042|page=89}}</ref> and was built in 1938.<ref name=EnglishHeritage /> The Plough public house was Kenton's first, opening in the early 18th century; the current building is not the original.

The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by [[David F. Friedman]] for [[Lionsgate Films|Cin\u00e9pix Film Properties]] in [[Montreal]]. The film stars [[Dyanne Thorne]] in the titular role, who is loosely based on [[Ilse Koch]], the wife of a real-life commandant at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].\n\nUpon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with [[Gene Siskel]] calling it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown\". Particular criticism was directed at the film's graphic violence; which includes depictions of [[castration]], [[flogging]], human experimentation, and many other forms of [[torture]]. Word-of-mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of [[grindhouse]] and [[drive-in theatres]].\n\nThe popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film's infamy eventually evolved into a considerable [[cult following]], with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with \u201cstrong, aggressive\u201d female authority.<ref name=\"av2\" /><ref name=\"av1\" /> The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the [[Nazisploitation]] sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the [[sexploitation]] sub-genre.\n\n==Plot==\nEurope, 1945. Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) is [[Kommandant]] of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] prison camp, who conducts [[Nazi human experimentation|sadistic scientific experiments]] designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the ever-depleting German armed forces. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her victims inevitably ejaculate, and promptly has them [[Castration|castrated]] and put to death.\n\nAfter dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of both male and female prisoners. Though largely dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe (Gregory Knoph); a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi [[Aryan]] ideal. Wolfe, a German-American student who had been studying in [[Berlin]] before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (Tony Mumolo), one of Ilsa's former victims, that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa's bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to orgasm, becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.\n\nHaving entered into Ilsa's confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa's tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa becomes gradually more and more anxious by news of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] breaking through German defenses and ever-encroaching. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa attempts to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The General is roundly impressed and awards Ilsa the [[Iron Cross]] for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent [[urolagnia]] by giving him a [[golden shower]].\n\nWith the Germans in retreat, the prisoners finally revolt, managing to kill most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her stockings by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they'll escape punishment, and summarily execute them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They're quickly outgunned by a [[Waffen-SS]] tank troupe, who promptly wipes out the small resistance.\n\nThe Commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up helplessly, he coldly shoots her in the head and kills her, before ordering the razing of the camp to destroy any evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of Ilsa's death camp.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dyanne Thorne]] as Ilsa\n* Gregory Knoph as Wolfe\n* Tony Mumolo as Mario\n* [[George Buck Flower]] as Binz <small>(as C.D.

Like many of its counterparts, Ilsa follows a [[women in prison film|women-in-prison formula]], but subverts it by having a female authority figure dominating male submissives.{{cn}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter [[Lee Frost (director)|Lee Frost]] and [[David F. Friedman]]'s ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1969) became successful in Canada, Andr\u00e9 Link and [[John Dunning (film producer)|John Dunning]] of [[Cinepix Film Properties]] sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film.<ref name=\"canux\" /> Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain.\n\nDunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and, later, [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> Nicknamed \u201cThe Bitch of Buchenwald\u201d, Koch engaged in several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film's central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal.\n\nLink and Dunning approached ''Love Camp 7'' producer [[David F. Friedman]] to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous \u201croughie\u201d sexploitation films, as well as [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]\u2019 seminal ''[[Blood Feast]]''. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who\u2019d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following ''Wild Honey'' and ''[[Tender Loving Care (film)|Tender Loving Care]]''.\n\n===Casting===\nFriedman\u2019s first choice of casting for the lead role was [[Phyllis Davis]]. When she proved unviable, he sought out [[Dyanne Thorne]] to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime [[Las Vegas]] showgirl who had studied under [[Stella Adler]], who at the time was working as a [[chauffeur]]. Thorne referred to the script as \u201cawful\u201d, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally.\n\nThe role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa's diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator [[George Buck Flower]], who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz's appearance is based on that of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a pioneering German [[sexologist]] (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti-Nazi and anti-fascist).\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in nine days.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> It used the [[Culver City]], [[California]] [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] of the TV series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"porning\" /> The series had already been cancelled and the show's producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, thus saving them the cost of having it demolished.\n\nBecause the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the [[Canadian Film Development Corporation]]\u2019s \u201cCapital Gains Allowance\u201d. Link and Dunning chose to both go uncredited in their capacities as executive producers.\n\n===Post-production===\nDuring editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film's opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential criticism. It reads: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as '[[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]' in special [[concentration camp]]s throughout [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Although these [[crimes against humanity]] are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\n\n===Use of pseudonyms===\nSeveral key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as \u201cHerman Traeger\u201d, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as \u201cJonah Royston\u201d, and actors George Buck Flower as \u201cC.D. Lafleuer\u201d and Richard Kennedy as \u201cWolfgang Roehm\u201d. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit, was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and does not hold any other credits of any kind.\n\n== Release ==\n''Ilsa'' was rejected by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] in 1975 and remains unreleased in the country.<ref name=\"bbfc\" /> It was [[List of banned films|banned]] in Australia, Germany, and Norway.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and [[grindhouse]] theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time.<ref name=\"grierson\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews.<ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n''The Independent Film Journal'' wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,'' a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\"<ref name=\"ifj\" />\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... ''Ilsa'' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I'm certain they would then remove it.\"<ref name=\"siskel\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade\u2014and the funniest. It's set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\"<ref name=\"canby\" /> Dave Kehr of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn't notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\".<ref name=\"kehr\" />\n\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\nThe film's director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\n==Accolades==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 [[AVN awards]], ten years after its initial release.<ref name=\"avn\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nDespite being almost-universally critically derided, the film has gained a significant cult following, in large part due to the endurance of the lead character and Thorne's [[campy|camp]] performance. Film scholar Rikki Schubert appraises the character as [[feminist]], writing in her book ''Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970\u20132006''  \u201cshe is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.\u201d\n\nArtist and filmmaker Twiggs Gorie likewise considers the film a feminist parable due to Ilsa's characterization as a strong and authoritarian figure, \u201cCan you imagine the balls it would take to live in this super-patriarchal [Nazi] society and turn around and tell her superior officers, \u2018I want to prove to you that we are just as good as the men\u2019? The whole ideology behind this government is, \u2018Oh no, you\u2019re a woman\u2014all you have to do is spread your legs and pump out some kids.\u2019 I see it as an empowerment film\u2014a wonderful display of strong, confident women. That image is missing in 2017\u2014it's missing from our cinema, it's missing from everything. I was a teenager in the early 2000s, and I saw the advent of those illegal-looking, American Apparel, super-weak-looking girls\u2014that's what everybody wanted. Bondage came into the mainstream, but it was women being submissive, and I was sick of it. I want stronger female role models and stronger female imagery. And when I look at this movie, that's what I see.\u201d\n\nThe character is considered a quintessential pop cultural depiction of [[sadomasochism]] and [[hypersexuality]], with Schubert writing that \u201cThe uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a \u2018castrating bitch.\u2019 She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.\u201d\n\n==Sequels==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' was followed by three [[sequel]]s, all variations on the [[sexploitation]] [[Women in prison film|women in prison]] theme:<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" />\n* ''[[Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks]]'' (1976) - the only sequel to be directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh\u2019s [[harem]].\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Wicked Warden]]'' (1977) - directed by [[Jes\u00fas Franco]]. ''Wicked Warden'' was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being an unrelated European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named \u2018Wanda\u2019. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Germany.\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia]]'' (also 1977) - directed by Jean LaFleur. It is the fourth and final entry, and the only entry to be shot on-location in [[Canada]]. It is unique among the series for its \u201ctwo-act\u201d structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian [[gulag]] in the [[Soviet Union]], while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day [[Montreal]], where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a [[brothel]] on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by [[Ivan Reitman]] and [[Roger Corman]] under the shared alias \u201cJulius Parnell\u201d.\n\nDespite her character being killed off at the end of the first film, Thorne reprised her role in three follow-ups, continuing to depict Ilsa as a sadomasochistic authority figure with an exaggerated German accent. None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In [[J\u00f6rg Buttgereit]]'s 1989 horror film ''[[Der Todesking]]'', a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' (Vera, the Death-Angel of the [[Gestapo]]), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard.\n* The 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' features a faux-trailer for a film called ''Werewolf Women of the S.S.'' by [[Rob Zombie]], whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character.<ref name=\"evers\" /><!--\nwho?\n* The American speed metal band At War recorded the song \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\", based on both the film and Ilse Koch.<ref name=\"metal\" /> \n-->\n*The New York hardcore band [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]] wrote the song \"Ilsa\" which was inspired by the movie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"av1\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.avclub.com/read-this-the-ongoing-controversy-of-ilsa-she-wolf-of-1798404855 \n| title = Read This: The ongoing controversy of Ilsa: She Wolf Of The SS \n| last = Colburn | first = Randall \n| website = The A.V.

The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by [[David F. Friedman]] for [[Lionsgate Films|Cin\u00e9pix Film Properties]] in [[Montreal]]. The film stars [[Dyanne Thorne]] in the titular role, who is loosely based on [[Ilse Koch]], the wife of a real-life commandant at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].\n\nUpon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with [[Gene Siskel]] calling it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown\". Particular criticism was directed at the film's graphic violence; which includes depictions of [[castration]], [[flogging]], human experimentation, and many other forms of [[torture]]. Word-of-mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of [[grindhouse]] and [[drive-in theatres]].\n\nThe popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film's infamy eventually evolved into a considerable [[cult following]], with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with \u201cstrong, aggressive\u201d female authority.<ref name=\"av2\" /><ref name=\"av1\" /> The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the [[Nazisploitation]] sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the [[sexploitation]] sub-genre.\n\n==Plot==\nEurope, 1945. Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) is [[Kommandant]] of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] prison camp, who conducts [[Nazi human experimentation|sadistic scientific experiments]] designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the ever-depleting German armed forces. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her victims inevitably ejaculate, and promptly has them [[Castration|castrated]] and put to death.\n\nAfter dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of both male and female prisoners. Though largely dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe (Gregory Knoph); a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi [[Aryan]] ideal. Wolfe, a German-American student who had been studying in [[Berlin]] before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (Tony Mumolo), one of Ilsa's former victims, that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa's bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to orgasm, becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.\n\nHaving entered into Ilsa's confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa's tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa becomes gradually more and more anxious by news of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] breaking through German defenses and ever-encroaching. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa attempts to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The General is roundly impressed and awards Ilsa the [[Iron Cross]] for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent [[urolagnia]] by giving him a [[golden shower]].\n\nWith the Germans in retreat, the prisoners finally revolt, managing to kill most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her stockings by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they'll escape punishment, and summarily execute them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They're quickly outgunned by a [[Waffen-SS]] tank troupe, who promptly wipes out the small resistance.\n\nThe Commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up helplessly, he coldly shoots her in the head and kills her, before ordering the razing of the camp to destroy any evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of Ilsa's death camp.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dyanne Thorne]] as Ilsa\n* Gregory Knoph as Wolfe\n* Tony Mumolo as Mario\n* [[George Buck Flower]] as Binz <small>(as C.D.

Like many of its counterparts, Ilsa follows a [[women in prison film|women-in-prison formula]], but subverts it by having a female authority figure dominating male submissives.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter [[Lee Frost (director)|Lee Frost]] and [[David F. Friedman]]'s ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1969) became successful in Canada, Andr\u00e9 Link and [[John Dunning (film producer)|John Dunning]] of [[Cinepix Film Properties]] sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film.<ref name=\"canux\" /> Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain.\n\nDunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and, later, [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> Nicknamed \u201cThe Bitch of Buchenwald\u201d, Koch engaged in several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film's central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal.\n\nLink and Dunning approached ''Love Camp 7'' producer [[David F. Friedman]] to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous \u201croughie\u201d sexploitation films, as well as [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]\u2019 seminal ''[[Blood Feast]]''. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who\u2019d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following ''Wild Honey'' and ''[[Tender Loving Care (film)|Tender Loving Care]]''.\n\n===Casting===\nFriedman\u2019s first choice of casting for the lead role was [[Phyllis Davis]]. When she proved unviable, he sought out [[Dyanne Thorne]] to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime [[Las Vegas]] showgirl who had studied under [[Stella Adler]], who at the time was working as a [[chauffeur]]. Thorne referred to the script as \u201cawful\u201d, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally.\n\nThe role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa's diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator [[George Buck Flower]], who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz's appearance is based on that of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a pioneering German [[sexologist]] (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti-Nazi and anti-fascist).\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in nine days.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" /> It used the [[Culver City]], [[California]] [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] of the TV series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"porning\" /> The series had already been cancelled and the show's producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, thus saving them the cost of having it demolished.\n\nBecause the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the [[Canadian Film Development Corporation]]\u2019s \u201cCapital Gains Allowance\u201d. Link and Dunning chose to both go uncredited in their capacities as executive producers.\n\n===Post-production===\nDuring editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film's opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential criticism. It reads: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as '[[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]' in special [[concentration camp]]s throughout [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Although these [[crimes against humanity]] are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\n\n===Use of pseudonyms===\nSeveral key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as \u201cHerman Traeger\u201d, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as \u201cJonah Royston\u201d, and actors George Buck Flower as \u201cC.D. Lafleuer\u201d and Richard Kennedy as \u201cWolfgang Roehm\u201d. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit, was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and does not hold any other credits of any kind.\n\n== Release ==\n''Ilsa'' was rejected by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] in 1975 and remains unreleased in the country.<ref name=\"bbfc\" /> It was [[List of banned films|banned]] in Australia, Germany, and Norway.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and [[grindhouse]] theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time.<ref name=\"grierson\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews.<ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n''The Independent Film Journal'' wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,'' a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\"<ref name=\"ifj\" />\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... ''Ilsa'' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I'm certain they would then remove it.\"<ref name=\"siskel\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade\u2014and the funniest. It's set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\"<ref name=\"canby\" /> Dave Kehr of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn't notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\".<ref name=\"kehr\" />\n\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\nThe film's director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".<ref name=\"av2\" />\n\n==Accolades==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 [[AVN awards]], ten years after its initial release.<ref name=\"avn\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nDespite being almost-universally critically derided, the film has gained a significant cult following, in large part due to the endurance of the lead character and Thorne's [[campy|camp]] performance. Film scholar Rikki Schubert appraises the character as [[feminist]], writing in her book ''Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970\u20132006''  \u201cshe is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.\u201d\n\nArtist and filmmaker Twiggs Gorie likewise considers the film a feminist parable due to Ilsa's characterization as a strong and authoritarian figure, \u201cCan you imagine the balls it would take to live in this super-patriarchal [Nazi] society and turn around and tell her superior officers, \u2018I want to prove to you that we are just as good as the men\u2019? The whole ideology behind this government is, \u2018Oh no, you\u2019re a woman\u2014all you have to do is spread your legs and pump out some kids.\u2019 I see it as an empowerment film\u2014a wonderful display of strong, confident women. That image is missing in 2017\u2014it's missing from our cinema, it's missing from everything. I was a teenager in the early 2000s, and I saw the advent of those illegal-looking, American Apparel, super-weak-looking girls\u2014that's what everybody wanted. Bondage came into the mainstream, but it was women being submissive, and I was sick of it. I want stronger female role models and stronger female imagery. And when I look at this movie, that's what I see.\u201d\n\nThe character is considered a quintessential pop cultural depiction of [[sadomasochism]] and [[hypersexuality]], with Schubert writing that \u201cThe uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a \u2018castrating bitch.\u2019 She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.\u201d\n\n==Sequels==\n''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' was followed by three [[sequel]]s, all variations on the [[sexploitation]] [[Women in prison film|women in prison]] theme:<ref name=\"nyt-obit\" />\n* ''[[Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks]]'' (1976) - the only sequel to be directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh\u2019s [[harem]].\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Wicked Warden]]'' (1977) - directed by [[Jes\u00fas Franco]]. ''Wicked Warden'' was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being an unrelated European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named \u2018Wanda\u2019. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Germany.\n* ''[[Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia]]'' (also 1977) - directed by Jean LaFleur. It is the fourth and final entry, and the only entry to be shot on-location in [[Canada]]. It is unique among the series for its \u201ctwo-act\u201d structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian [[gulag]] in the [[Soviet Union]], while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day [[Montreal]], where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a [[brothel]] on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by [[Ivan Reitman]] and [[Roger Corman]] under the shared alias \u201cJulius Parnell\u201d.\n\nDespite her character being killed off at the end of the first film, Thorne reprised her role in three follow-ups, continuing to depict Ilsa as a sadomasochistic authority figure with an exaggerated German accent. None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In [[J\u00f6rg Buttgereit]]'s 1989 horror film ''[[Der Todesking]]'', a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' (Vera, the Death-Angel of the [[Gestapo]]), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard.\n* The 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' features a faux-trailer for a film called ''Werewolf Women of the S.S.'' by [[Rob Zombie]], whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character.<ref name=\"evers\" /><!--\nwho?\n* The American speed metal band At War recorded the song \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\", based on both the film and Ilse Koch.<ref name=\"metal\" /> \n-->\n*The New York hardcore band [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]] wrote the song \"Ilsa\" which was inspired by the movie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"av1\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.avclub.com/read-this-the-ongoing-controversy-of-ilsa-she-wolf-of-1798404855 \n| title = Read This: The ongoing controversy of Ilsa: She Wolf Of The SS \n| last = Colburn | first = Randall \n| website = The A.V.

Abyssinia is also mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]]. While many Ethiopians claim that the Bible references of Kush apply to their own ancient civilization, pointing out that the [[Gihon]] river, a name for the [[Nile]], is said to flow through the land, some scholars believe that the use of the term referred to the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in particular, or Africa outside of Egypt in general. The modern name ''Ethiopia'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Aethiopia]]'' used to translate ''Kush'', and was applied to all of Sub-Saharan Africa, including what is now [[Sudan]], but with a few classical geographers giving more detailed descriptions of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea (e.g. [[Adulis]]) as well.\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Islam in Ethiopia}}\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img33 Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mosque]] in [[Mekelle]].]]\n[[Islam in Ethiopia]] dates back to the founding of the religion; in 615, when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in [[Mecca]] and [[Migration to Abyssinia|travel to Ethiopia via modern-day Eritrea]], which was ruled by [[Ashama ibn Abjar]], a pious Christian king.

While many Ethiopians claim that the Bible references of Kush apply to their own ancient civilization, pointing out that the [[Gihon]] river, a name for the [[Nile]], is said to flow through the land, some scholars believe that the use of the term referred to the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in particular, or Africa outside of Egypt in general. The modern name ''Ethiopia'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Aethiopia]]'' used to translate ''Kush'', and was applied to all of Sub-Saharan Africa, including what is now [[Sudan]], but with a few classical geographers giving more detailed descriptions of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea (e.g. [[Adulis]]) as well.\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Islam in Ethiopia}}\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img33 Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mosque]] in [[Mekelle]].]]\n[[Islam in Ethiopia]] dates back to the founding of the religion; in 615, when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in [[Mecca]] and [[Migration to Abyssinia|travel to Ethiopia via modern-day Eritrea]], which was ruled by [[Ashama ibn Abjar]], a pious Christian king.
