This was intended to prevent producers from forcing them upon directors, which would inhibit the development of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> The guild also required that the director be credited, in support of the [[Auteur|auteur theory]], which posits that the director is the primary creative force behind a film.<ref name=\"directedby\" />\n\nThe Smithee pseudonym was created for use on the film ''[[Death of a Gunfighter]]'', released in 1969. During its filming, lead actor [[Richard Widmark]] was unhappy with director [[Robert Totten]] and arranged to have him replaced by [[Don Siegel]]. Siegel later estimated that he had spent 9 to 10 days filming, while Totten had spent 25 days. Each had roughly an equal amount of footage in Siegel's final edit, but Siegel made clear that Widmark had effectively been in charge the entire time.<ref name=\"directedby\" /> When the film was finished, Siegel did not want to take the credit for it and Totten refused to take credit in his place. The DGA panel hearing the dispute agreed that the film did not represent either director's creative vision.<ref name=\"LATimes\" />\n\nThe original proposal was to credit the fictional \"Al Smith\", but the name was deemed too common and was already in use within the film industry. The last name was first changed to \"Smithe\", then \"Smithee\",<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> which was thought to be distinctive enough to avoid confusion with similar names but without drawing attention to itself.<ref name=\"directedby\" /> Critics praised the film and its \"new\" director, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' commenting that the film was \"sharply directed by Allen Smithee who has an adroit facility for scanning faces and extracting sharp background detail,\"<ref>Thompson, Howard (May 10, 1969). \"Screen: Tough Western: 'Death of a Gunfighter' Stars Widmark\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=2&title1=Death%20of%20a%20Gunfighter%20(Movie)&title2=&reviewer=HOWARD%20THOMPSON&pdate=19690510&v_id=12954&oref=slogin&oref=login]{{Dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{Cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] commenting, \"Director Allen Smithee, a name I'm not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19690512/REVIEWS/905120301/1023 |title=Roger Ebert's review of '&#39;Death of a Gunfighter'&#39; |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 12, 1969 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing its coinage, the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\" was applied retroactively to ''[[Fade In (film)|Fade In]]'' (also known as ''Iron Cowboy''), a film starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and directed by [[Jud Taylor]], which was first released before the release of ''Death of a Gunfighter''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Notorc |url=http://notorc.blogspot.com/2006/06/almost-famous-spelvins-plinges-and.html |title=Postscripts: Almost Famous: The Spelvins, the Plinges and the Smithees |publisher=Notorc.blogspot.com |date=December 6, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Taylor also requested the pseudonym for ''[[City in Fear]]'' (1980) with [[David Janssen]].

Some directors violated the embargo on discussing their use of the pseudonym. In 1998, the film ''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]'' was released, in which a man named Alan Smithee ([[Eric Idle]]) wishes to disavow a film he has directed, but is unable to do so because the only pseudonym he is permitted to use is his own name. The film was directed by [[Arthur Hiller]], who reported to the DGA that producer [[Joe Eszterhas]] had interfered with his creative control, and successfully removed his own name from the film, so Alan Smithee was credited instead. The film was a commercial and critical failure, released in only 19 theaters, grossing only $45,779 in the United States with a budget of about $10 million,<ref name=\"burnmojo\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=burnhollywoodburn.htm |title=''Burn Hollywood Burn'' at Box Office Mojo |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> and Rotten Tomatoes reports an aggregate critical rating of only 8% positive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/burn_hollywood_burn/ |title=''Burn Hollywood Burn'' at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date=August 5, 2003 |access-date=January 27, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100302194524/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/burn_hollywood_burn/| archivedate= March 2, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The harsh negative publicity that surrounded the film drew unwanted mainstream attention to the pseudonym. Following this, the DGA retired the name; for the film ''[[Supernova (2000 film)|Supernova]]'' (2000), dissatisfied director [[Walter Hill]] was instead credited as \"Thomas Lee.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271 |title=Name of Director Smithee Isn't What It Used to Be|work=Los Angeles Times|date= January 15, 2000|access-date=January 27, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the name had been used outside of the film industry, and it continues to be used in other media and on film projects not under the purview of the DGA. Although the pseudonym was intended for use by directors, the Internet Movie Database lists several uses as writer credits as well.<ref name=\"Alan Smithee\" /> Variations of the name have also occasionally been used, such as \"Alan and Alana Smithy\" (screenwriters for the 2011 film ''[[Hidden 3D]]'').\n\n== Uses ==\nHistorical uses of the \"Alan Smithee\" credit (or equivalent), in chronological order:\n\n=== Film direction ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2017}}\nThe following films credit \"Smithee\"; the actual director is listed when known.\nIn a few cases the alias is used for a creative contributor other than the director, shown in boldface.\n* ''[[Fade In (film)|Fade In]]'' aka ''Iron Cowboy'' (1968), directed by [[Jud Taylor]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW8j6sHvrewC|title=Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors|first=Jerry|last=Roberts|date=June 5, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780810863781}}</ref> Shown in previews with Taylor credited, then shelved; issued in 1975 with Smithee credited as director.\n* ''[[Death of a Gunfighter]]'' (1969), directed separately by Robert Totten and Don Siegel<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[The Barking Dog]]'' (1978), director unknown<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[Gypsy Angels]]'' (1980), director unknown<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[City in Fear]]'' (1980), directed by Jud Taylor\n* ''Fun and Games'' (1980), directed by [[Paul Bogart]]<ref>{{IMDb title|0080769|Fun and Games}}</ref>\n* ''[[Student Bodies]]'' (1981), directed by [[Mickey Rose]], produced by [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] under the name of Smithee\n* ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), Second Assistant Director Anderson House used the pseudonym for the first segment of the film, in which actor [[Vic Morrow]] and two children were [[Twilight Zone accident|killed in a helicopter accident]] during production.

This was intended to prevent producers from forcing them upon directors, which would inhibit the development of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> The guild also required that the director be credited, in support of the [[Auteur|auteur theory]], which posits that the director is the primary creative force behind a film.<ref name=\"directedby\" />\n\nThe Smithee pseudonym was created for use on the film ''[[Death of a Gunfighter]]'', released in 1969. During its filming, lead actor [[Richard Widmark]] was unhappy with director [[Robert Totten]] and arranged to have him replaced by [[Don Siegel]]. Siegel later estimated that he had spent 9 to 10 days filming, while Totten had spent 25 days. Each had roughly an equal amount of footage in Siegel's final edit, but Siegel made clear that Widmark had effectively been in charge the entire time.<ref name=\"directedby\" /> When the film was finished, Siegel did not want to take the credit for it and Totten refused to take credit in his place. The DGA panel hearing the dispute agreed that the film did not represent either director's creative vision.<ref name=\"LATimes\" />\n\nThe original proposal was to credit the fictional \"Al Smith\", but the name was deemed too common and was already in use within the film industry. The last name was first changed to \"Smithe\", then \"Smithee\",<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> which was thought to be distinctive enough to avoid confusion with similar names but without drawing attention to itself.<ref name=\"directedby\" /> Critics praised the film and its \"new\" director, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' commenting that the film was \"sharply directed by Allen Smithee who has an adroit facility for scanning faces and extracting sharp background detail,\"<ref>Thompson, Howard (May 10, 1969). \"Screen: Tough Western: 'Death of a Gunfighter' Stars Widmark\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=2&title1=Death%20of%20a%20Gunfighter%20(Movie)&title2=&reviewer=HOWARD%20THOMPSON&pdate=19690510&v_id=12954&oref=slogin&oref=login]{{Dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{Cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] commenting, \"Director Allen Smithee, a name I'm not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19690512/REVIEWS/905120301/1023 |title=Roger Ebert's review of '&#39;Death of a Gunfighter'&#39; |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 12, 1969 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing its coinage, the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\" was applied retroactively to ''[[Fade In (film)|Fade In]]'' (also known as ''Iron Cowboy''), a film starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and directed by [[Jud Taylor]], which was first released before the release of ''Death of a Gunfighter''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Notorc |url=http://notorc.blogspot.com/2006/06/almost-famous-spelvins-plinges-and.html |title=Postscripts: Almost Famous: The Spelvins, the Plinges and the Smithees |publisher=Notorc.blogspot.com |date=December 6, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Taylor also requested the pseudonym for ''[[City in Fear]]'' (1980) with [[David Janssen]]. Taylor commented on its use when he received the DGA's [[Robert Aldrich|Robert B.

Some directors violated the embargo on discussing their use of the pseudonym. In 1998, the film ''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]'' was released, in which a man named Alan Smithee ([[Eric Idle]]) wishes to disavow a film he has directed, but is unable to do so because the only pseudonym he is permitted to use is his own name. The film was directed by [[Arthur Hiller]], who reported to the DGA that producer [[Joe Eszterhas]] had interfered with his creative control, and successfully removed his own name from the film, so Alan Smithee was credited instead. The film was a commercial and critical failure, released in only 19 theaters, grossing only $45,779 in the United States with a budget of about $10 million,<ref name=\"burnmojo\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=burnhollywoodburn.htm |title=''Burn Hollywood Burn'' at Box Office Mojo |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> and Rotten Tomatoes reports an aggregate critical rating of only 8% positive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/burn_hollywood_burn/ |title=''Burn Hollywood Burn'' at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date=August 5, 2003 |access-date=January 27, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100302194524/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/burn_hollywood_burn/| archivedate= March 2, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The harsh negative publicity that surrounded the film drew unwanted mainstream attention to the pseudonym. Following this, the DGA retired the name; for the film ''[[Supernova (2000 film)|Supernova]]'' (2000), dissatisfied director [[Walter Hill]] was instead credited as \"Thomas Lee.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271 |title=Name of Director Smithee Isn't What It Used to Be|work=Los Angeles Times|date= January 15, 2000|access-date=January 27, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the name had been used outside of the film industry, and it continues to be used in other media and on film projects not under the purview of the DGA. Although the pseudonym was intended for use by directors, the Internet Movie Database lists several uses as writer credits as well.<ref name=\"Alan Smithee\" /> Variations of the name have also occasionally been used, such as \"Alan and Alana Smithy\" (screenwriters for the 2011 film ''[[Hidden 3D]]'').\n\n== Uses ==\nHistorical uses of the \"Alan Smithee\" credit (or equivalent), in chronological order:\n\n=== Film direction ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2017}}\nThe following films credit \"Smithee\"; the actual director is listed when known.\nIn a few cases the alias is used for a creative contributor other than the director, shown in boldface.\n* ''[[Fade In (film)|Fade In]]'' aka ''Iron Cowboy'' (1968), directed by [[Jud Taylor]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW8j6sHvrewC|title=Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors|first=Jerry|last=Roberts|date=June 5, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780810863781}}</ref> Shown in previews with Taylor credited, then shelved; issued in 1975 with Smithee credited as director.\n* ''[[Death of a Gunfighter]]'' (1969), directed separately by Robert Totten and Don Siegel<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[The Barking Dog]]'' (1978), director unknown<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[Gypsy Angels]]'' (1980), director unknown<ref name=\"auto\" />\n* ''[[City in Fear]]'' (1980), directed by Jud Taylor\n* ''Fun and Games'' (1980), directed by [[Paul Bogart]]<ref>{{IMDb title|0080769|Fun and Games}}</ref>\n* ''[[Student Bodies]]'' (1981), directed by [[Mickey Rose]], produced by [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] under the name of Smithee\n* ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), Second Assistant Director Anderson House used the pseudonym for the first segment of the film, in which actor [[Vic Morrow]] and two children were [[Twilight Zone accident|killed in a helicopter accident]] during production.
