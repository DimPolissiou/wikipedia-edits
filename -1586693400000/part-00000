The DATF has a presence in each of the command areas as DATF (West), DATF (East) and DATF (North).  The DATF (North) is unique amongst the three in having sub-offices in N Division (Highlands and Islands), A Division (North-East) and D Division (Tayside). The DATF has national responsibility for pro-actively addressing domestic abuse.  Its divisional equivalents are the Domestic Abuse Investigation Units.\n\nAnother unit within the division is the Force Flexible Policing Unit (FFPU, or \"Flexi Teams\" as they are known locally), based in all three command areas (North, East, West). This unit's primary function is to act upon specific geographical intelligence relating to spikes in crime trends (particularly involving violence, alcohol, antisocial behaviour or other high volume crime), and carrying out taskings in the form of high visibility patrols and public reassurance.\n\n===Operational Support Division===\n\n====Roads Policing====\n\nPolicing of Scotland's roads network is the responsibility of the Roads Policing Unit. The unit is split into three areas, west, east and north which cover their respective Local Police Divisions.  The departments aim is to achieve casualty reduction and wider operational objectives. There are roughly 500 road policing officers in Scotland, Chief Superintendent Stewart Carle is currently the head of roads policing.<ref name=SPA_PBM_Mar13>{{cite web|title=Statement of Operational Readiness Day 1|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/140136/item08-policescotlandopreadiness|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\nThe Collision Investigation unit sits within Road Policing division. Unlike many other forces, there is no dedicated Collision Investigation. Instead investigating serious and fatal RTCs lies with specially trained officers who carry out the role beside their core road patrol functions.\n\n====Operational Support Unit====\n\nSix operational support units (OSUs) have been established to provide specially skilled officers trained in over ground search, [[Riot control|public order]] and [[CBRN defense|chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]] (CBRN) response. When not used in their specialist roles OSU officers are deployed in local communities focusing on issues as directed by demand. OSUs are based in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee (North), Edinburgh and Alloa (East) and Glasgow (West). Across the force area the OSU comprises a total of 6 Inspectors, 18 Sergeants and 172 Constables.<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_AUG13\">{{cite web|title=PSOS Paper \u2013 OSU Paper|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/meetings-events/board-meetings/178259/|work=Public Board Meeting 21st August 2013|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Armed Policing====\nArmed Policing provides [[Armed Response Vehicle]]s (ARV), the Specialist Firearms Unit and Armed Policing Training.\n\nPrior to the inception of Police Scotland, the routine tasking and visibility of ARV officers varied widely across Scotland with deployment models varying for matters such as if officers carried side arms with a standing authority or if they were secured in the vehicles.

The Special Branches' primary role is to gather intelligence on terrorist operations and all terrorist related incidents, when the special branch obtains any intelligence they shall pass on the information to the security service (MI5) or the service / agency appropirate to the current situation. The Special Branch also gathers intelligence on political and animal rights extremist activity, and any environmental extremism. In addition the Special Branch provides personal protection to VIPs or certain individuals who may be vulnerable to potential terror attacks or other types of attacks. The special branch works very closely with the Secret Intelligence Service ([[MI6]]), The Security Service ([[MI5]]), and many police forces in the UK.\n\n====Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit====\n\nPolice Scotland has limited responsibilities when it comes down to counter terrorism, with the [[Metropolitan Police]] being the main force behind counter terrorism operations throughout the UK. However, the SCD does have counter-terrorism in its remit, and relies on daily support from several UK agencies, including [[MI5]] and the [[Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism]] at the [[Home Office]].\n\n====Major Investigation Teams====\n\nMajor Investigation Teams (MITs) are located throughout Scotland and are responsible for leading the investigation of all murder inquiries and large-scale and complex criminal investigations. Although each MIT will be responsible for investigating cases within its own area, where required they will be able to be deployed anywhere in the country to respond to need and demand.<ref name=scd>{{cite web|title=Specialist Crime Division|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/specialist crime-division/|publisher=Police Scotland|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====National Counter Corruption Unit====\n\nThe National Counter Corruption Unit is the first of its kind in UK policing and works in partnership with the public sector to prevent corruption in publicly funded organisations. The unit also offers a specialist investigative capability. The unit is split into two teams, one focused internally within Police Scotland whilst a second team focuses on other publicly funded organisations.<ref name=ccr-oct13 />\n\n====National Human Trafficking Unit====\n\nThe existing Scottish Intelligence Coordination Unit and Strathclyde Police Vice and Trafficking Unit combined on 1 April 2013 to form the new National Human Trafficking Unit (NHTU).<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_Mar13\"/>\n\n====National Rape Taskforce====\n\nThe investigation of rape and other sexual offences is a key priority for Police Scotland. National Rape Taskforce units are located in Glasgow and Aberdeen and work alongside Divisional Rape Investigation Units. They provide a national investigative capacity and a case review function.<ref name=\"scd\"/><ref name=ccr-oct13>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 2nd October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/188888/item11|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Prison Intelligence Unit====\n\nThe Prison Intelligence Unit (PIU) provides an interface for the exchange of information and intelligence between Police Scotland and the [[Scottish Prison Service]]. The unit also develops and supports policy, procedure, planning, research, technology development, advice and communication between Police Scotland and the Scottish Prison Service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 30th October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/192814/item10|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Licensing and Violence Reduction Division===\nThe Licensing and Violence Reduction Division (LVRD) contains a number of miscellaneous functions including the titular alcohol licensing and violence reduction teams.\n\nOne of the higher-profile units within the LVRD is the Domestic Abuse Task Force (DATF).  The DATF has a presence in each of the command areas as DATF (West), DATF (East) and DATF (North).  The DATF (North) is unique amongst the three in having sub-offices in N Division (Highlands and Islands), A Division (North-East) and D Division (Tayside). The DATF has national responsibility for pro-actively addressing domestic abuse.  Its divisional equivalents are the Domestic Abuse Investigation Units.\n\nAnother unit within the division is the Force Flexible Policing Unit (FFPU, or \"Flexi Teams\" as they are known locally), based in all three command areas (North, East, West). This unit's primary function is to act upon specific geographical intelligence relating to spikes in crime trends (particularly involving violence, alcohol, antisocial behaviour or other high volume crime), and carrying out taskings in the form of high visibility patrols and public reassurance.\n\n===Operational Support Division===\n\n====Roads Policing====\n\nPolicing of Scotland's roads network is the responsibility of the Roads Policing Unit. The unit is split into three areas, west, east and north which cover their respective Local Police Divisions.  The departments aim is to achieve casualty reduction and wider operational objectives. There are roughly 500 road policing officers in Scotland, Chief Superintendent Stewart Carle is currently the head of roads policing.<ref name=SPA_PBM_Mar13>{{cite web|title=Statement of Operational Readiness Day 1|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/140136/item08-policescotlandopreadiness|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\nThe Collision Investigation unit sits within Road Policing division. Unlike many other forces, there is no dedicated Collision Investigation. Instead investigating serious and fatal RTCs lies with specially trained officers who carry out the role beside their core road patrol functions.\n\n====Operational Support Unit====\n\nSix operational support units (OSUs) have been established to provide specially skilled officers trained in over ground search, [[Riot control|public order]] and [[CBRN defense|chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]] (CBRN) response. When not used in their specialist roles OSU officers are deployed in local communities focusing on issues as directed by demand. OSUs are based in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee (North), Edinburgh and Alloa (East) and Glasgow (West). Across the force area the OSU comprises a total of 6 Inspectors, 18 Sergeants and 172 Constables.<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_AUG13\">{{cite web|title=PSOS Paper \u2013 OSU Paper|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/meetings-events/board-meetings/178259/|work=Public Board Meeting 21st August 2013|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Armed Policing====\nArmed Policing provides [[Armed Response Vehicle]]s (ARV), the Specialist Firearms Unit and Armed Policing Training.\n\nPrior to the inception of Police Scotland, the routine tasking and visibility of ARV officers varied widely across Scotland with deployment models varying for matters such as if officers carried side arms with a standing authority or if they were secured in the vehicles.

While the vast majority of these immigrants integrated into Latin American societies, some still held German citizenship at the time of Germany's declaration of war in 1941. Prior to World War II both the German and U.S. governments were actively competing for political influence across Latin America and with the outbreak of war the U.S. government was fearful that nationals of the belligerent countries could pose a threat. Subsequently several thousand German, Japanese and Italian nationals were arrested by Latin American governments and many were deported to internment camps in the U.S. for the duration of the conflict. Following the war most were repatriated to their home countries. \n\n== Background ==\n=== German Influence in Latin America ===\nGermany's involvement in the region had existed since the 19th century. Waves of German immigrants had been generally welcomed into the region, partially as a result of the popularity of racist ideologies among Latin America's political and economic elites who often believed in the myth of the [[Protestant work ethic]] and the superiority of Northern European Protestants immigrants over Southern European Catholics. The Nazi German Government primarily viewed Latin America as a source of raw materials and attempted to deepen commercial relations with the region during the inter-war period.<ref>Vampire diplomacy: Nazi economic Nationalism in Latin America, 1934\u201340, Salvatore Prisco, Diplomacy & Statecraft, Vol. 2, 1991</ref> Germany offered military training and sold weapons to several Latin American governments and several Latin American governments in an attempt to undermine U.S. influence in the region. During the 1930s sympathetic [[far-right]] and [[fascist]] political movements, most notably Brazil's [[Brazilian Integralism|Integralism movement]] and Argentina's [[Nacionalismo (Argentine political movement)|Nacionalismo movement]] attempted to gain control in their respective states. Following World War II thousands of Nazis would [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|escape to Latin America]] and avoid capture by the Allies thanks to Nazi sympathizers in Latin America, some of whom held military and political positions in Latin America's governments.\n\n=== American influence in Latin America ===\nSince the establishment of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] the United States Government sought and gained an influential position in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. During the 1930s, the American intervention in region, which began in 1898 (see the [[Spanish American War]] and the [[banana wars]]) on behalf of local elites and U.S. corporations,  was replaced by the [[Good Neighbor policy]] which was made official at the [[Montevideo Convention]] in 1933. American influence in the region remained significant during the pre-war period and included the [[Panama Canal Zone|U.S. control over]] the recently built [[Panama Canal]].\n\n=== U.S. - Germany Relations in Latin America immediately prior to 1941 ===\nBy 1941, the US was supplying war materials to democracies fighting against the Axis powers under the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act of 1941]].

Beginning in 1940 the American government took to blacklisting companies and individuals with German ties from these, and most, Latin American countries.

Of the returnees, 15 were eventually interviewed on their experiences in the American internment camps.

While the vast majority of these immigrants integrated into Latin American societies, some still held German citizenship at the time of Germany's declaration of war in 1941. Prior to World War II both the German and U.S. governments were actively competing for political influence across Latin America and with the outbreak of war the U.S. government was fearful that nationals of the belligerent countries could pose a threat. Subsequently several thousand German, Japanese and Italian nationals were arrested by Latin American governments and many were deported to internment camps in the U.S. for the duration of the conflict. Following the war most were repatriated to their home countries. \n\n== Background ==\n=== German Influence in Latin America ===\nGermany's involvement in the region had existed since the 19th century. Waves of German immigrants had been generally welcomed into the region, partially as a result of the popularity of racist ideologies among Latin America's political and economic elites who often believed in the myth of the [[Protestant work ethic]] and the superiority of Northern European Protestants immigrants over Southern European Catholics. The Nazi German Government primarily viewed Latin America as a source of raw materials and attempted to deepen commercial relations with the region during the inter-war period.<ref>Vampire diplomacy: Nazi economic Nationalism in Latin America, 1934\u201340, Salvatore Prisco, Diplomacy & Statecraft, Vol. 2, 1991</ref> Germany offered military training and sold weapons to several Latin American governments and several Latin American governments in an attempt to undermine U.S. influence in the region. During the 1930s sympathetic [[far-right]] and [[fascist]] political movements, most notably Brazil's [[Brazilian Integralism|Integralism movement]] and Argentina's [[Nacionalismo (Argentine political movement)|Nacionalismo movement]] attempted to gain control in their respective states. Following World War II thousands of Nazis would [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|escape to Latin America]] and avoid capture by the Allies thanks to Nazi sympathizers in Latin America, some of whom held military and political positions in Latin America's governments.\n\n=== American influence in Latin America ===\nSince the establishment of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] the United States Government sought and gained an influential position in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. During the 1930s, the American intervention in region, which began in 1898 (see the [[Spanish American War]] and the [[banana wars]]) on behalf of local elites and U.S. corporations,  was replaced by the [[Good Neighbor policy]] which was made official at the [[Montevideo Convention]] in 1933. American influence in the region remained significant during the pre-war period and included the [[Panama Canal Zone|U.S. control over]] the recently built [[Panama Canal]].\n\n=== U.S. - Germany Relations in Latin America immediately prior to 1941 ===\nBy 1941, the US was supplying war materials to democracies fighting against the Axis powers under the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act of 1941]].

The selection was conducted by both by local governments and by American instructions. In total, 4,058 Germans were deported to the US.<ref name=\":4\" /> ''The Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals'' was used as the basis for deportation in many Latin American countries. Many more ethnic Germans in Latin American were also selected for deportation.

Internees of German, Japanese, and Italian descent from both the US and Latin America were interned together. Crystal City, a purpose-built internment camp for large families had notably well conditions. Japanese internees beautified the camp with gardening and landscaping; education was provided in English, German, Japanese, and Spanish; a swimming pool was built for the children, large families have their own house with kitchens, bathrooms, running water, and ice boxes.<ref name=\":6\" /> Karl-Albrecht Engel, one of the internees from the camp, reported in a letter to the German government:\n\n\u201c''We grew tan and swelled up like doughnuts from the good meal. Three hot meals a day, starting with eggs and sausages in the morning and ending with oysters or meat and potatoes for dinner.

Beginning in 1940 the American government took to blacklisting companies and individuals with German ties from these, and most, Latin American countries. The stated rationale was to deny funding to local Nazi sympathizing factions, however the reality was that these American policies made it increasingly difficult for any German detainee to return to their family and home.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Nazis and good neighbors : the United States campaign against the Germans of Latin America in World War II|author=Max Paul Friedman|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Of the returnees, 15 were eventually interviewed on their experiences in the American internment camps. Repatriation was particularly difficult for returning deportees who would lose everything through the internment, as with the case of Hugo Droege, whose farm in Guatemala had been seized after he was forcibly taken to America.<ref name=\":9\" /> Party ties prior to deportation often made repatriation difficult, as with the case of Droege, and some others, affiliations with the Nazi party, called by Droege \u201cnot real membership\u201d haunted them beyond the war.\n\n=== Post-war ===\nMany of the deported German Latin Americans who would return to South America saw great difficulty in continuing life the same. Many countries had adopted strict anti-Nazi and anti-German policies, contributing to the governments seizing German holdings across Latin America. Repatriation took much more than just returning home, it was a process of becoming at home in Latin America again, a process that took longer than many would have hoped.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Aftermath and legacy ==\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nIn the aftermath of the mass deportations, many companies owned by German deportees in Latin America were confiscated and expropriated, despite US intelligence recognizing that the resulting seizures would cause grave economic harm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nazis and good neighbors : the United States campaign against the Germans of Latin America in World War II|author=Max Paul Friedman|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Many had already been sent to Germany over the course of the war, but for those who had stayed in the US, some (depending the country they had been deported from) were given the opportunity to return back to Latin America.<ref name=\":8\"/> However, their return wasn\u2019t necessarily the end of their ordeal, with many returning to find that their property and belongings had been confiscated. Additionally, these returning Germans found themselves marked and excluded from societies that the once thought of as home, as anti-immigrant and German sentiment dogged many Latin American countries as a result of the deportations.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n=== US Congressional investigation and reparations ===\n[[File:Ronald Reagan signing Japanese reparations bill.jpg|thumb|Ronald Reagan signing Japanese reparations bill]]\nIn 1980, a Commission was approved by Congress as a \u201cfact finding study\u201d to look into the deportation of civilians to U.S. internment camps. This commission published its report in 1983, bringing to light the US government\u2019s actions in this period. However, this commission\u2019s recognition of the treatment of German civilians from Latin Americans was limited only to its appendix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg48322/html/CHRG-111hhrg48322.htm|title=- TREATMENT OF LATIN AMERICANS OF JAPANESE DESCENT, EUROPEAN AMERICANS, AND JEWISH REFUGEES DURING WORLD WAR II|website=www.govinfo.gov|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> In 1988, the United States Congress passed the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], which granted a formal apology and reparations to Japanese Americans interned during World War 2, with a $20,000 US payout to all survivors. However, these reparations and the subsequent apology did not pertain to non-U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who were deported to the United States from Latin America. \n\nBecause the law was restricted to American citizens, and to legal permanent residents, ethnic Japanese who had been [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Japanese Latin Americans|taken from their homes in Latin America]] (mostly from Peru), were not covered in the reparations, regardless of whether they had remained in the United States, had returned to Latin America, or had been deported to Japan after the war.

However, during the [[presidential system]] of governance, Bangladesh had a vice-president who would assume the president's role in his absence; the post was abolished by the twelfth amendment to the Constitution in 1991.<ref name=amendments />\n\n== Removal ==\n\nA president can resign from office by writing a letter by hand to the Speaker. The president can also be impeached by the Parliament. In case of impeachment, the Parliament must bring specific charges against the president, and investigate it themselves, or refer it to any other body for investigation. The president will have the right to defend himself. Following the proceedings, the president is impeached immediately if two-thirds of the Parliament votes in favour, and the Speaker ascends to power.<ref name=cons />\n\n== Presidential residences and office ==\n\nThe principal Presidential residence at [[Bangabhaban]] is located in [[Dhaka]].

After the oath ceremony was held at Meherpur, Kushtia, the government-in-exile set up its headquarters at 8 Theatre Road, in [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta), India. The first Bangladesh President to take oath of office was [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] with [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] as the first prime minister. After the war ended, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] became the prime minister with the election of the first parliament a year later in January, 1972.\n\nLater in 1973 under a new constitution, the set up began under a parliamentary system of government where the president was a nominal head of the state while all the executive powers were vested in the prime minister. In 1974, the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman switched from parliamentary to a single party presidential system banning all press, political parties and activities under the State of Emergency.\n\n'''Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'''\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman was the apparent acting president of a state yet to be known as Bangladesh (during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation war of Bangladesh]], when it was still called [[East Pakistan]], before he was captured, taken to West Pakistan, and kept in a Pakistani prison. His imprisonment therefore resulted in his absence during the entire war-time, which lasted almost a year. In his absence, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], vice-president of the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was appointed as acting president). He was the founder of Bangladesh and remarked as the 'Father of the Bangladesh Nation'. He headed the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], served as the president from April 1971 to 1972; was the prime minister from 1972 and the president in 1975. He is popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib, and with the honorary title of Bangabandhu (\u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7\u09c1 B\u00f4ngobondhu, \"Friend of Bengal\"). His eldest daughter [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] is the present leader of the Awami League and the current prime minister of Bangladesh. He introduced the state policy of Bangladesh according to four basic principles: nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism.<ref name=History>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/the-basics/history-of-bangladesh/a-historical-overview-of-bangladesh/ |title=Bangladesh History: An overview |encyclopedia=[[Virtual Bangladesh]] |publisher=Virtual Bangladesh |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Awami League won a massive majority in the first parliamentary elections of Bangladesh in March 1973 much due to Mujib's high-profile and as the single large political oppressor. However, the Mujib government faced serious challenges, which included the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state's economy had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. Economically, Mujib embarked on a huge nationalisation program. The economy suffered as a result of socialist planning. By the end of the year, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan, and thousands of non-Bengalis migrated to Pakistan; and yet many thousands remained in refugee camps.\nIt was not until the late 1970s that the new born nation saw any sign of progress when the government came under the administrative rule of [[Ziaur Rahman]]. And unlike the Mujib Government, Zia's rule was widely acclaimed as he reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets, initiating mass irrigation and food production programs, including social programs to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as SAARC. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's International airport(HSIA) was materialised. Zia became a popular World leader for his efforts to stabilise Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West, and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Zia faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts. It remains controversial even today.\n\n=== Dictatorships and Presidential system (1974\u201391) ===\nIn 1974, Mujib proclaimed a State of Emergency. The then parliament amended the constitution to limit the powers of the legislative and judicial branches, established a single party executive presidency. These changes were remarked as the \"Second Revolution,\" by Sheikh Mujib.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League|title=Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2017-04-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812135725/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Sheikh Mujib assumed the presidency. All political parties were dissolved and a single new party was created as the 'National Party'. It was named as the [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]] (BAKSAL), in which all members of parliament, government and semi-autonomous associations and bodies were obliged to join.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter Bangladesh achieved recognition from most countries, Sheikh Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation. He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh's security forces and government personnel. Mujib forged a close friendship with Indira Gandhi, strongly praising India's decision to intercede, and professed admiration and friendship for India. But the Indian government did not remain in close co-operation with Bangladesh during Mujib's lifetime.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHe charged the provisional parliament to write a new constitution, and proclaimed the four fundamental principles of \"nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism,\" which would come to be known as \"Mujibism.\" Mujib nationalised hundreds of industries and companies as well as abandoned land and capital and initiated land reform aimed at helping millions of poor farmers. Major efforts were launched to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million refugees. The economy began recovering and a famine was prevented. A constitution was proclaimed in 1972 and elections were held, which resulted in Sheikh Mujib and his party gaining power with an absolute majority. He further outlined state programmes to expand primary education, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country. A five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture, rural infrastructure and cottage industries.\n\n'''Assassination of Mujibur Rahman'''\n{{main|Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman}}\nImplementation of promised political reforms was slow, and Mujib increasingly was criticised. In August 1975, he was assassinated by junior and mid-level army officers, and a new government, headed by a former associate, [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad|Khandakar Moshtaque]], was formed. Mushtaq's government was removed by a silent coup that occurred on 3 November 1975. A counter uprising occurred four days later on 7 November, resulting from a power struggle, and Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman emerged into the political scene returning to the post of Army Chief of Staff. He pledged the army's support to the civilian government headed by the president, Chief Justice [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]]. As the country was in dire situation with no stability and security, acting at Zia's behest, Sayem then promulgated martial law, continued Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's State of Emergency, and less than replaced President [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA).<ref name=History/>\n\n'''Ziaur Rahman (BNP)'''\n\nInitially as Deputy CMLA, Ziaur Rahman sought to invigorate government policy and administration. While continuing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's ban on political parties, he sought to revitalise the demoralised bureaucracy, to begin new economic development programs, and to emphasise family planning.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} A year later in November 1976, Ziaur Rahman became [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]] (CMLA). He assumed the presidency upon Sayem's retirement 5 months later, promising national elections in 1978. After a Yes-No nationwide vote referendum, Ziaur Rahman was elected for president in 1978. His government removed the remaining restrictions on political parties and encouraged all opposition parties to participate in the pending parliamentary elections. He freed the press, and introduced a market economy. More than 30 parties vied in the parliamentary elections of 15 February 1979, and with massive public support Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won 207 of the 300 elected seats.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Islamic ideology'''\n\nZia moved to lead the nation in a new direction, significantly different from the ideology and agenda of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League and [[BAKSAL]].<ref name=\"Rule\">{{cite web\n |last        = Country Studies\n |first       = Bangladesh\n |date        = 12 September 2006\n |url         = http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/21.htm\n |title       = Zia regime\n |access-date  = 12 September 2006\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161113093702/http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/21.htm\n |archive-date = 13 November 2016\n}}</ref> He issued a proclamation order amending the constitution, replacing secularism with increasing the faith of the people in their creator.

Zia emphasised the national role of Islam (as practised by the majority of Bangladeshis). Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the [[Santal]]s, [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]], [[Manipur]]is and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], as well as the [[Urdu]]-speaking peoples of [[Bihar]]i origin. However, many of these groups were predominantly [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhist]] and were alienated by Zia's promotion of political Islam. In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] Development Commission in 1976, but resisted holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation.<ref name=\"CHTD\">{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120203138/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 2 July 1977 Ziaur Rahman organised a tribal convention to promote a dialogue between the government and tribal groups. However, most cultural and political issues would remain unresolved and intermittent incidents of inter-community violence and militancy occurred throughout Zia's rule.<ref name=\"CHTD\"/>\n\n'''Reforms and international relations'''\n\nNotable mentions of Ziaur Rahman's tenure as a president have been radical reforms both in country's infrastructure and diplomacy. President Zia successfully pointed out the grounds those could be effectively and exclusively decisive for development of Bangladesh and his reforms covered the political, economical, agricultural and military infrastructure of Bangladesh. Reorganisation of Bangladesh's international relations are especially mentionable because it had active influence over both economy and politics. He successfully bailed Bangladesh out of the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|Indo-Soviet bloc]] and grabbed the distancing strings to put bar on the gradually deterioration of Bangladeshi relations with the [[Western world]]. Zia gave attention to the other Eastern superpower [[China]] that later helped Bangladesh hugely to recover from economical setbacks and to enrich the arsenal of her [[Bangladesh Armed Forces|armed forces]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe most notable of Zia's reformed diplomacy was establishing a relationship with the Muslim world as well as the [[Middle East]]. The present bulk overseas recruitment of Bangladeshi migrant workers to Middle Eastern countries are direct outcome of Zia's efforts those he put to develop a long-lasting relationship with the [[OIC|Muslim leadership of the world]]. The purpose of Middle East relations has been largely economical whereas the rapid improvement of relations with China was particularly made to for rapid advancement of the country's armed forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThroughout the study of Zia's international relations it could have been suggested that attention to the bigger neighbour [[India]] has been largely ignored. But Zia was found to put strong emphasis on regional co-operation particularly for [[South Asia]]. It came evident after Zia took initiative to found [[SAARC]]. Zia's dream of Bangladesh's involvement in a strong regional co-operation was met after 4 years of his assassination when SAARC got founded on 8 December 1985 with a key role of the then Bangladeshi authority.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n'''Assassination of Ziaur Rahman'''\n\n{{main|Assassination of Ziaur Rahman}}\nIn 1981, Zia was assassinated by dissident elements of the military. Vice-President Justice Abdus Sattar was constitutionally sworn in as acting president. He declared a new national emergency and called for elections within 6 months. Sattar was elected president and won. Sattar was ineffective, however, and Army Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup in March 1982.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Hussain Muhammad Ershad (Jatiya Party)'''\n\nLike his predecessors, Ershad dissolved parliament, declared martial law, assumed the position of CMLA, suspended the constitution, and banned political activity. Ershad reaffirmed Bangladesh's moderate, non-aligned foreign policy.<ref name=History/>\n\nIn December 1983, he assumed the presidency. Over the ensuing months, Ershad sought a formula for elections while dealing with potential threats to public order.<ref name=History/>\n\nOn 1 January 1986, full political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the Jatiyo (People's) Party (JP), designed as Ershad's political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established. Ershad resigned as chief of army staff, retired from military service, and was elected president in October 1986. (Both the BNP and the AL refused to put up an opposing candidate.)<ref name=History/>\n\nIn July 1987, the opposition parties united for the first time in opposition to government policies. Ershad declared a state of emergency in November, dissolved parliament in December, and scheduled new parliamentary elections for March 1988.\n\nAll major opposition parties refused to participate. Ershad's party won 251 of the 300 seats; three other political parties which did participate, as well as a number of independent candidates, shared the remaining seats. This parliament passed a large number of legislative bills, including a controversial amendment making Islam the state religion.\n\nBy mid-1990, opposition to Ershad's rule had escalated. November and December 1990 were marked by general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. Ershad resigned in December 1990.\n\n=== Restoration of Parliamentary system (1991\u2014present) ===\nIt was reverted to democratic parliamentary system in 1991 when [[Khaleda Zia]] became the first female prime minister of Bangladesh through parliamentary election.\n\nThe president is the [[head of state]], a largely ceremonial post elected by the parliament.<ref name=\"Background Note: Bangladesh\"/> However, the president's powers have been substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.<ref name=\"amendments\">{{cite book |last=Ahamed |first=Emajuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Constitutional Amendments |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Constitutional_Amendments |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908205413/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Constitutional_Amendments |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the caretaker government, the president has the power to control over the Ministry of Defence, the authority to declare a state of emergency, and the power to dismiss the Chief Adviser and other members of the caretaker government.

After the oath ceremony was held at Meherpur, Kushtia, the government-in-exile set up its headquarters at 8 Theatre Road, in [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta), India. The first Bangladesh President to take oath of office was [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] with [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] as the first prime minister. After the war ended, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] became the prime minister with the election of the first parliament a year later in January, 1972.\n\nLater in 1973 under a new constitution, the set up began under a parliamentary system of government where the president was a nominal head of the state while all the executive powers were vested in the prime minister. In 1974, the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman switched from parliamentary to a single party presidential system banning all press, political parties and activities under the State of Emergency.\n\n'''Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'''\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman was the apparent acting president of a state yet to be known as Bangladesh (during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation war of Bangladesh]], when it was still called [[East Pakistan]], before he was captured, taken to West Pakistan, and kept in a Pakistani prison. His imprisonment therefore resulted in his absence during the entire war-time, which lasted almost a year. In his absence, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], vice-president of the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was appointed as acting president). He was the founder of Bangladesh and remarked as the 'Father of the Bangladesh Nation'. He headed the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], served as the president from April 1971 to 1972; was the prime minister from 1972 and the president in 1975. He is popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib, and with the honorary title of Bangabandhu (\u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7\u09c1 B\u00f4ngobondhu, \"Friend of Bengal\"). His eldest daughter [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] is the present leader of the Awami League and the current prime minister of Bangladesh. He introduced the state policy of Bangladesh according to four basic principles: nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism.<ref name=History>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/the-basics/history-of-bangladesh/a-historical-overview-of-bangladesh/ |title=Bangladesh History: An overview |encyclopedia=[[Virtual Bangladesh]] |publisher=Virtual Bangladesh |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Awami League won a massive majority in the first parliamentary elections of Bangladesh in March 1973 much due to Mujib's high-profile and as the single large political oppressor. However, the Mujib government faced serious challenges, which included the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state's economy had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. Economically, Mujib embarked on a huge nationalisation program. The economy suffered as a result of socialist planning. By the end of the year, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan, and thousands of non-Bengalis migrated to Pakistan; and yet many thousands remained in refugee camps.\nIt was not until the late 1970s that the new born nation saw any sign of progress when the government came under the administrative rule of [[Ziaur Rahman]]. And unlike the Mujib Government, Zia's rule was widely acclaimed as he reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets, initiating mass irrigation and food production programs, including social programs to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as SAARC. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's International airport(HSIA) was materialised. Zia became a popular World leader for his efforts to stabilise Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West, and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Zia faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts. It remains controversial even today.\n\n=== Dictatorships and Presidential system (1974\u201391) ===\nIn 1974, Mujib proclaimed a State of Emergency. The then parliament amended the constitution to limit the powers of the legislative and judicial branches, established a single party executive presidency. These changes were remarked as the \"Second Revolution,\" by Sheikh Mujib.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League|title=Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2017-04-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812135725/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Sheikh Mujib assumed the presidency. All political parties were dissolved and a single new party was created as the 'National Party'. It was named as the [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]] (BAKSAL), in which all members of parliament, government and semi-autonomous associations and bodies were obliged to join.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter Bangladesh achieved recognition from most countries, Sheikh Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation. He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh's security forces and government personnel. Mujib forged a close friendship with Indira Gandhi, strongly praising India's decision to intercede, and professed admiration and friendship for India. But the Indian government did not remain in close co-operation with Bangladesh during Mujib's lifetime.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHe charged the provisional parliament to write a new constitution, and proclaimed the four fundamental principles of \"nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism,\" which would come to be known as \"Mujibism.\" Mujib nationalised hundreds of industries and companies as well as abandoned land and capital and initiated land reform aimed at helping millions of poor farmers. Major efforts were launched to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million refugees. The economy began recovering and a famine was prevented. A constitution was proclaimed in 1972 and elections were held, which resulted in Sheikh Mujib and his party gaining power with an absolute majority. He further outlined state programmes to expand primary education, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country. A five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture, rural infrastructure and cottage industries.\n\n'''Assassination of Mujibur Rahman'''\n{{main|Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman}}\nImplementation of promised political reforms was slow, and Mujib increasingly was criticised. In August 1975, he was assassinated by junior and mid-level army officers, and a new government, headed by a former associate, [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad|Khandakar Moshtaque]], was formed. Mushtaq's government was removed by a silent coup that occurred on 3 November 1975. A counter uprising occurred four days later on 7 November, resulting from a power struggle, and Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman emerged into the political scene returning to the post of Army Chief of Staff. He pledged the army's support to the civilian government headed by the president, Chief Justice [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]]. As the country was in dire situation with no stability and security, acting at Zia's behest, Sayem then promulgated martial law, continued Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's State of Emergency, and less than replaced President [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA).<ref name=History/>\n\n'''Ziaur Rahman (BNP)'''\n\nInitially as Deputy CMLA, Ziaur Rahman sought to invigorate government policy and administration. While continuing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's ban on political parties, he sought to revitalise the demoralised bureaucracy, to begin new economic development programs, and to emphasise family planning.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} A year later in November 1976, Ziaur Rahman became [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]] (CMLA). He assumed the presidency upon Sayem's retirement 5 months later, promising national elections in 1978. After a Yes-No nationwide vote referendum, Ziaur Rahman was elected for president in 1978. His government removed the remaining restrictions on political parties and encouraged all opposition parties to participate in the pending parliamentary elections. He freed the press, and introduced a market economy. More than 30 parties vied in the parliamentary elections of 15 February 1979, and with massive public support Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won 207 of the 300 elected seats.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Islamic ideology'''\n\nZia moved to lead the nation in a new direction, significantly different from the ideology and agenda of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League and [[BAKSAL]].<ref name=\"Rule\">{{cite web\n |last        = Country Studies\n |first       = Bangladesh\n |date        = 12 September 2006\n |url         = http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/21.htm\n |title       = Zia regime\n |access-date  = 12 September 2006\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161113093702/http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/21.htm\n |archive-date = 13 November 2016\n}}</ref> He issued a proclamation order amending the constitution, replacing secularism with increasing the faith of the people in their creator.

Zia emphasised the national role of Islam (as practised by the majority of Bangladeshis). Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the [[Santal]]s, [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]], [[Manipur]]is and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], as well as the [[Urdu]]-speaking peoples of [[Bihar]]i origin. However, many of these groups were predominantly [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhist]] and were alienated by Zia's promotion of political Islam. In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] Development Commission in 1976, but resisted holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation.<ref name=\"CHTD\">{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120203138/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 2 July 1977 Ziaur Rahman organised a tribal convention to promote a dialogue between the government and tribal groups. However, most cultural and political issues would remain unresolved and intermittent incidents of inter-community violence and militancy occurred throughout Zia's rule.<ref name=\"CHTD\"/>\n\n'''Reforms and international relations'''\n\nNotable mentions of Ziaur Rahman's tenure as a president have been radical reforms both in country's infrastructure and diplomacy. President Zia successfully pointed out the grounds those could be effectively and exclusively decisive for development of Bangladesh and his reforms covered the political, economical, agricultural and military infrastructure of Bangladesh. Reorganisation of Bangladesh's international relations are especially mentionable because it had active influence over both economy and politics. He successfully bailed Bangladesh out of the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|Indo-Soviet bloc]] and grabbed the distancing strings to put bar on the gradually deterioration of Bangladeshi relations with the [[Western world]]. Zia gave attention to the other Eastern superpower [[China]] that later helped Bangladesh hugely to recover from economical setbacks and to enrich the arsenal of her [[Bangladesh Armed Forces|armed forces]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe most notable of Zia's reformed diplomacy was establishing a relationship with the Muslim world as well as the [[Middle East]]. The present bulk overseas recruitment of Bangladeshi migrant workers to Middle Eastern countries are direct outcome of Zia's efforts those he put to develop a long-lasting relationship with the [[OIC|Muslim leadership of the world]]. The purpose of Middle East relations has been largely economical whereas the rapid improvement of relations with China was particularly made to for rapid advancement of the country's armed forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThroughout the study of Zia's international relations it could have been suggested that attention to the bigger neighbour [[India]] has been largely ignored. But Zia was found to put strong emphasis on regional co-operation particularly for [[South Asia]]. It came evident after Zia took initiative to found [[SAARC]]. Zia's dream of Bangladesh's involvement in a strong regional co-operation was met after 4 years of his assassination when SAARC got founded on 8 December 1985 with a key role of the then Bangladeshi authority.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n'''Assassination of Ziaur Rahman'''\n\n{{main|Assassination of Ziaur Rahman}}\nIn 1981, Zia was assassinated by dissident elements of the military. Vice-President Justice Abdus Sattar was constitutionally sworn in as acting president. He declared a new national emergency and called for elections within 6 months. Sattar was elected president and won. Sattar was ineffective, however, and Army Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup in March 1982.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Hussain Muhammad Ershad (Jatiya Party)'''\n\nLike his predecessors, Ershad dissolved parliament, declared martial law, assumed the position of CMLA, suspended the constitution, and banned political activity. Ershad reaffirmed Bangladesh's moderate, non-aligned foreign policy.<ref name=History/>\n\nIn December 1983, he assumed the presidency. Over the ensuing months, Ershad sought a formula for elections while dealing with potential threats to public order.<ref name=History/>\n\nOn 1 January 1986, full political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the Jatiyo (People's) Party (JP), designed as Ershad's political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established. Ershad resigned as chief of army staff, retired from military service, and was elected president in October 1986. (Both the BNP and the AL refused to put up an opposing candidate.)<ref name=History/>\n\nIn July 1987, the opposition parties united for the first time in opposition to government policies. Ershad declared a state of emergency in November, dissolved parliament in December, and scheduled new parliamentary elections for March 1988.\n\nAll major opposition parties refused to participate. Ershad's party won 251 of the 300 seats; three other political parties which did participate, as well as a number of independent candidates, shared the remaining seats. This parliament passed a large number of legislative bills, including a controversial amendment making Islam the state religion.\n\nBy mid-1990, opposition to Ershad's rule had escalated. November and December 1990 were marked by general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. Ershad resigned in December 1990.\n\n=== Restoration of Parliamentary system (1991\u2014present) ===\nIt was reverted to democratic parliamentary system in 1991 when [[Khaleda Zia]] became the first female prime minister of Bangladesh through parliamentary election.\n\nThe president is the [[head of state]], a largely ceremonial post elected by the parliament.<ref name=\"Background Note: Bangladesh\"/> However, the president's powers have been substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.<ref name=\"amendments\">{{cite book |last=Ahamed |first=Emajuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Constitutional Amendments |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Constitutional_Amendments |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908205413/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Constitutional_Amendments |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the caretaker government, the president has the power to control over the Ministry of Defence, the authority to declare a state of emergency, and the power to dismiss the Chief Adviser and other members of the caretaker government. Once elections have been held and a new government and Parliament are in place, the president's powers and position revert to their largely ceremonial role. The Chief Adviser and other advisers to the caretaker government must be appointed within 15 days after the current Parliament expires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traveldocs.com/bd/govern.htm |title=World Atlas - About Bangladesh |accessdate=2011-09-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062113/http://www.traveldocs.com/bd/govern.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Bangladesh Government Information</ref>\n\n== List of presidents ==\n{{main|List of Presidents of Bangladesh}}\n\n<gallery style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Living former Presidents\">\nFile:Seal of the President of Bangladesh.svg|{{center|'''[[Shahabuddin Ahmed]]'''<br />[[Independent (politician)|Ind.]]}} {{center|{{small|(interim), Acting 1990-1991}}}} {{center|{{small|12th, served 1996- 2001}}}} {{center|{{small|{{birth date and age|1930|2|1}}}}}}\nFile:Seal of the President of Bangladesh.svg|{{center|'''[[A.

[[John Keel]], author and parapsychologist, in both his writings and at his appearances at INFO's FortFest, says \"the International Fortean Organization (INFO) carries on [[Charles Fort]]'s name as successor to the Fortean Society.\"  Keel, [[Colin Wilson]] and [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] were long-time advisors to the organization.\n\nThe International Fortean Organization (INFO) published the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown'', keeps a library of Forteana and offered a research service. ''Science Digest'', in 1978, mentions their \"attempts to handle inquiries from a world-wide membership\".  The ''Skeptic's Dictionary'' says \"The International Fortean Organization publishes INFO Journal several times a year.  It features stories on such topics as anomalous astronomical phenomena, anomalies in the physical sciences, scientific hoaxes and cryptozoology.\"  The quarterly ''INFO Journal'' grew from a 54-page publication to a 69-page publication and according to ''Factsheet Five'', a publication dedicated to the review of periodicals, by 1993 was the longest-running Fortean publication.\n\n[[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] and [[Bob Rickard]] in their book ''Unexplained Phenomena'' said of the International Fortean Organization \"INFO was founded in 1965 as the natural successor to the original [[Fortean Society]].\"  Colin Wilson said he wished to assure ''The American Spectator'' that Charles Fort is far from forgotten and credited the publishing efforts of the International Fortean Organization's ''INFO Journal''.\n\nUna McGovern in ''Chamber's Dictionary of the Unexplained'' said, \"Seven years lapsed between the demise of the [[Fortean Society]] and the formation of the International Fortean Organization (INFO)...which played a vital role in encouraging a new generation of young forteans.\"  Although the Fortean Society was never officially dissolved their aims were continued by the International Fortean Organization according to Lewis Spence in the \"Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology\" and encouraged by [[Damon Knight]] who credited the organization in his introduction to the Complete Works of Charles Fort published by Dover.  [[Martin Gardner]], in a chapter devoted to Fort, which according to the ''Sceptic Report'' neither scorns or damns, in ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'', notes that Fort doubted everything, even his own speculations. Gardner makes the point that Forteanism serves to remind science that no theory is above doubt, and that knowledge is provisional, it serves a 'sound and healthy' purpose.\n\n==History==\n\nThe organization was formed in the early 1960s by brothers, the writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the original Fortean Society which had begun in 1932 in the spirit of Charles Fort but which had grown silent by 1959 with the death of its founder [[Tiffany Thayer]]. The Fortean Society was formed by a friend of Charles Fort,  Theodore Dreiser, who had threatened his publisher that he would leave if ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' was not put into print.  The original society included many of New York's literati including [[Booth Tarkington]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Alexander Woollcott]] and [[Dorothy Parker]].  Oliver Wendall Holmes and [[H.L. Mencken]] were also early members along with a number of fledgling science-fiction writers such as [[Eric Frank Russell]], [[Edmond Hamilton]] and [[Damon Knight]].\n\nDan Oldenburg in the ''Washington Post'' said of the all-volunteer staffed International Fortean Organization, \"Its membership ranges from hard-core skeptics to top scholars to true believers -- but its cornerstone is open-mindedness.\"\n\nThe Willis brothers owned a bookstore in the States (Arlington, Virginia) and were also publishers of SF fanzines and magazines of speculative fiction and non-fiction, notably \"Anubis\".  They enjoyed a long-time correspondence and relationship with many Fort-inspired science fiction writers such as [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and, especially [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who remained a loyal member and friend to INFO until his death.  Paul was an exceptionally avid letter and article writer and had long-running data exchanges with an international group of nascent forteans including [[Bob Rickard]] who went on to found \"The Times\" in 1967, later the \"[[Fortean Times]]\", which was encouraged to expand with the help of corporate sponsorship.  Rickard, and others, urged Paul Willis to publish. INFO was incorporated as a non-profit in 1965. The \"INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown\" was born shortly thereafter in the Spring of 1967.\n\nMembership was set at $12US and Heinlein would dutifully send in a check which was promptly framed and put on the wall.  Heinlein would then send in a letter complaining that his check had not been cashed, along with suggestions for articles and improvements and, that too, would be framed and put on the wall.  This incident is mentioned more than a few times in the \"INFO Journal\".\n\nRon Willis, with help from his brother Paul, and in collaboration with [[Jacques Bergier]], in 1974 brought out the book, ''Extraterrestrial Intervention, the Evidence'', published by Henry Regnary Company in the US and as in France as ''Le Livre de l'inexplicable'' by Editions Alvin Michel. The authorship (or editorship) is credited to \"Jacques Bergier and the Editors of INFO\" and contains many articles reprinted from the \"INFO Journal\".\n\nThe Willis', under the banner of the International Fortean Organization, had also started a conference called FortFest with speeches given by and largely attended by those working in the field of anomalous phenomena.  Early INFO conferences included INFO members [[David Drake]], also a long-time member of the INFO Board of Directors, who went on to have over one hundred science-fiction novels published and the legendary fortean [[John Keel]] who frequently presented at FortFest, as often as his intermittent health permitted.  Keel was, and still is, an advisor and friend to INFO and would give FortFest a generous plug during his stint as a contributing editor at [[Fate Magazine]] and be available for midnight wit and wisdom consultations. Keel also gave INFO collections of his early magazine publishing efforts which inspired many articles in the INFO Journal and which INFO lent to Board member [[Mark Chorvinsky]] who was eager to start his own magazine, Strange.  Keel started his own short-lived, prestigious, New York Fortean Society and named Phyllis Benjamin as a Founding Member and awarded her his often called \"coveted\" Falling Frog Award for contributions to continuing the work of Charles Fort in 1988.  Other recipients of the Falling Frog Award included notable fortean writers/researchers [[Doug Skinner]] and Antonio Huneeus.\n\nThe Willis' and an ex-pat American living in Canada who called himself Mr. X (after one of Charles Fort's unpublished novels) were concerned that Fort's works, in the public domain, would be lost to posterity and engaged in a letter campaign and, eventually, went to New York City to Dover Publications, Inc. to urge them to publish the works.  Dover complied and the following is from \"The Complete Works of Charles Fort\", 1974 edition with an introduction by [[Damon Knight]] \"Founder and President of Science Fiction Writers of America, author \"Charles Fort, Prophet of the Unexplained\":..This Dover edition;...a replication of the omnibus volume originally published for the Fortean Society by Henry Holt and Company, New York in 1941.  The four books by Fort are unabridged and unaltered, but the 1941 Introduction by Tiffany Thayer has been omitted...The present edition has had the encouragement and cooperation of the International Fortean Organization (Info), P.O. Box 367, Arlington, Virginia 22210.\"\n\nThe Arlington post office box was moved to P.O. Box N, College Park, MD 20740 to reflect the location of the INFO offices and the INFO Library in College Park.  Paul Willis relocated to College Park following the 1975 death from a brain tumor of Ron Willis.  An office was found for INFO's 10,000+ books and large collection of clippings, files, and magazines such as the complete issues of \"Doubt\" dating back to the original Fortean Society along with letters from Theodore Dreiser, Tiffany Thayer and Ben Hecht.  The original notes of Charles Fort had been donated to the New York Public Library where they remain today.\n\nINFO rented space in the Washington, D.C. suburbs.  Paul Willis named the building NO! in protest of a new-age bookstore called YES! who had rejected an INFO-visiting Bob Rickard who had petitioned YES! to carry the works of Charles Fort, The Fortean Times and the INFO Journal.  INFO remained based in College Park for over twenty years until a fire necessitated a move in 2003.\n\t \nThe International Fortean Organization (INFO) holds a solid niche in the annals of forteana.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Harvey, David (1986), ''Thorsons Complete Guide to Alternative Living'', p.&nbsp;300, Thorsons, Indiana University\n*''Science Digest'' (1978), p.&nbsp;50, v. 83, Jan-Jun, Hearst Corp.\n*[[Robert Todd Carroll]] (2003), ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', p.&nbsp;150, Body, Mind & Spirit\n*Gunderloy, Mike (1993), ''Factsheet Five'', item notes 47-48, University of Michigan\n*Michell, John and Rickard Bob (2000), ''Phenomena: A Rough Guide Special'', p.&nbsp;367, Rough Guides\n*Spence, Lewis (2003), Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology Part 1: V. 1, Edition: 3, p.&nbsp;341, Kessinger Publishing\n*McGovern, Una (2007), ''Chambers Dictionary of the Unexplained'', p.&nbsp;238, Chambers Harrap Publishers Limited\n*Gardner, Martin, p.&nbsp;49, ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''\n*Oldenburg, Dan (2003), p.&nbsp;C1, ''The Man Who Has the Fringe Tied Up in Knots'', ''Washington Post''\n*Wilson, Colin (1995), p.&nbsp;80, ''The American Spectator'', Saturday Evening Club, University of Virginia\n*P.M.H.

The original society included many of New York's literati including [[Booth Tarkington]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Alexander Woollcott]] and [[Dorothy Parker]].  Oliver Wendall Holmes and [[H.L. Mencken]] were also early members along with a number of fledgling science-fiction writers such as [[Eric Frank Russell]], [[Edmond Hamilton]] and [[Damon Knight]].\n\nDan Oldenburg in the ''Washington Post'' said of the all-volunteer staffed International Fortean Organization, \"Its membership ranges from hard-core skeptics to top scholars to true believers -- but its cornerstone is open-mindedness.\"\n\nThe Willis brothers owned a bookstore in the States (Arlington, Virginia) and were also publishers of SF fanzines and magazines of speculative fiction and non-fiction, notably \"Anubis\".  They enjoyed a long-time correspondence and relationship with many Fort-inspired science fiction writers such as [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and, especially [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who remained a loyal member and friend to INFO until his death.  Paul was an exceptionally avid letter and article writer and had long-running data exchanges with an international group of nascent forteans including [[Bob Rickard]] who went on to found \"The Times\" in 1967, later the \"[[Fortean Times]]\", which was encouraged to expand with the help of corporate sponsorship.  Rickard, and others, urged Paul Willis to publish. INFO was incorporated as a non-profit in 1965. The \"INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown\" was born shortly thereafter in the Spring of 1967.\n\nMembership was set at $12US and Heinlein would dutifully send in a check which was promptly framed and put on the wall.  Heinlein would then send in a letter complaining that his check had not been cashed, along with suggestions for articles and improvements and, that too, would be framed and put on the wall.  This incident is mentioned more than a few times in the \"INFO Journal\".\n\nRon Willis, with help from his brother Paul, and in collaboration with [[Jacques Bergier]], in 1974 brought out the book, ''Extraterrestrial Intervention, the Evidence'', published by Henry Regnary Company in the US and as in France as ''Le Livre de l'inexplicable'' by Editions Alvin Michel. The authorship (or editorship) is credited to \"Jacques Bergier and the Editors of INFO\" and contains many articles reprinted from the \"INFO Journal\".\n\nThe Willis', under the banner of the International Fortean Organization, had also started a conference called FortFest with speeches given by and largely attended by those working in the field of anomalous phenomena.  Early INFO conferences included INFO members [[David Drake]], also a long-time member of the INFO Board of Directors, who went on to have over one hundred science-fiction novels published and the legendary fortean [[John Keel]] who frequently presented at FortFest, as often as his intermittent health permitted.  Keel was, and still is, an advisor and friend to INFO and would give FortFest a generous plug during his stint as a contributing editor at [[Fate Magazine]] and be available for midnight wit and wisdom consultations. Keel also gave INFO collections of his early magazine publishing efforts which inspired many articles in the INFO Journal and which INFO lent to Board member [[Mark Chorvinsky]] who was eager to start his own magazine, Strange.  Keel started his own short-lived, prestigious, New York Fortean Society and named Phyllis Benjamin as a Founding Member and awarded her his often called \"coveted\" Falling Frog Award for contributions to continuing the work of Charles Fort in 1988.  Other recipients of the Falling Frog Award included notable fortean writers/researchers [[Doug Skinner]] and Antonio Huneeus.\n\nThe Willis' and an ex-pat American living in Canada who called himself Mr. X (after one of Charles Fort's unpublished novels) were concerned that Fort's works, in the public domain, would be lost to posterity and engaged in a letter campaign and, eventually, went to New York City to Dover Publications, Inc. to urge them to publish the works.  Dover complied and the following is from \"The Complete Works of Charles Fort\", 1974 edition with an introduction by [[Damon Knight]] \"Founder and President of Science Fiction Writers of America, author \"Charles Fort, Prophet of the Unexplained\":..This Dover edition;...a replication of the omnibus volume originally published for the Fortean Society by Henry Holt and Company, New York in 1941.  The four books by Fort are unabridged and unaltered, but the 1941 Introduction by Tiffany Thayer has been omitted...The present edition has had the encouragement and cooperation of the International Fortean Organization (Info), P.O. Box 367, Arlington, Virginia 22210.\"\n\nThe Arlington post office box was moved to P.O. Box N, College Park, MD 20740 to reflect the location of the INFO offices and the INFO Library in College Park.  Paul Willis relocated to College Park following the 1975 death from a brain tumor of Ron Willis.  An office was found for INFO's 10,000+ books and large collection of clippings, files, and magazines such as the complete issues of \"Doubt\" dating back to the original Fortean Society along with letters from Theodore Dreiser, Tiffany Thayer and Ben Hecht.  The original notes of Charles Fort had been donated to the New York Public Library where they remain today.\n\nINFO rented space in the Washington, D.C. suburbs.  Paul Willis named the building NO! in protest of a new-age bookstore called YES! who had rejected an INFO-visiting Bob Rickard who had petitioned YES! to carry the works of Charles Fort, The Fortean Times and the INFO Journal.  INFO remained based in College Park for over twenty years until a fire necessitated a move in 2003.\n\t \nThe International Fortean Organization (INFO) holds a solid niche in the annals of forteana.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Harvey, David (1986), ''Thorsons Complete Guide to Alternative Living'', p.&nbsp;300, Thorsons, Indiana University\n*''Science Digest'' (1978), p.&nbsp;50, v. 83, Jan-Jun, Hearst Corp.\n*[[Robert Todd Carroll]] (2003), ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', p.&nbsp;150, Body, Mind & Spirit\n*Gunderloy, Mike (1993), ''Factsheet Five'', item notes 47-48, University of Michigan\n*Michell, John and Rickard Bob (2000), ''Phenomena: A Rough Guide Special'', p.&nbsp;367, Rough Guides\n*Spence, Lewis (2003), Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology Part 1: V. 1, Edition: 3, p.&nbsp;341, Kessinger Publishing\n*McGovern, Una (2007), ''Chambers Dictionary of the Unexplained'', p.&nbsp;238, Chambers Harrap Publishers Limited\n*Gardner, Martin, p.&nbsp;49, ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''\n*Oldenburg, Dan (2003), p.&nbsp;C1, ''The Man Who Has the Fringe Tied Up in Knots'', ''Washington Post''\n*Wilson, Colin (1995), p.&nbsp;80, ''The American Spectator'', Saturday Evening Club, University of Virginia\n*P.M.H.

The team is one of the leading teams in [[Europe]] since the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n===In the Russian Empire===\nWater polo in Russia dates back to 1910, when the sport was included into the national water sports programme. The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and [[Moscow]], with the first winning 3\u20132. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.<ref>[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=8#8 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0418\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u0418\u0418]</ref>\n\n===In the Soviet Union===\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and [[Leningrad]] (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], [[Baltic Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]] further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among [[sailor]]s. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, [[physical culture]] has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.<ref name=\"Soviet\">[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=9#9 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]</ref>\n\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and [[Kiev]], the tournament featured teams from the [[Caucasus]], [[Crimea]], [[Ural (region)|Ural]], as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the [[FINA]]. The national water polo then debuted at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in Helsinki.<ref name=\"Soviet\"/>\n\n==Results==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n===Olympic Games===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The team is one of the leading teams in [[Europe]] since the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n===In the Russian Empire===\nWater polo in Russia dates back to 1910, when the sport was included into the national water sports programme. The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and [[Moscow]], with the first winning 3\u20132. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.<ref>[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=8#8 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0418\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u0418\u0418]</ref>\n\n===In the Soviet Union===\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and [[Leningrad]] (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], [[Baltic Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]] further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among [[sailor]]s. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, [[physical culture]] has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.<ref name=\"Soviet\">[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=9#9 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]</ref>\n\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and [[Kiev]], the tournament featured teams from the [[Caucasus]], [[Crimea]], [[Ural (region)|Ural]], as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the [[FINA]]. The national water polo then debuted at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in Helsinki.<ref name=\"Soviet\"/>\n\n==Results==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n===Olympic Games===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

It runs north\u2013south in central and southeast Wisconsin from [[Wittenberg, Wisconsin|Wittenberg]] to [[Lomira, Wisconsin|Lomira]]. The highway was initially designated in 1917, but it had not been extended to its current length until the 1950s.\n\n==Route description==\nWIS&nbsp;93 begins at an interchange with [[Interstate 41]] (I-41) north of [[Lomira, Wisconsin|Lomira]] and runs west from it, passing through [[Brownsville, Wisconsin|Brownsville]] before curving to the north to meet the [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]]-[[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] county line. After an interchange with [[U.S. Route 151|US&nbsp;151]] (US&nbsp;151), WIS&nbsp;49 runs through [[Waupun, Wisconsin|Waupun]]. Shortly after exiting Waupun, the highway curves and starts running north to [[Brandon, Wisconsin|Brandon]]. Shortly after exiting Brandon, the highway [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[Wisconsin Highway 44|WIS&nbsp;44]]. This concurrency ends in [[Ripon, Wisconsin|Ripon]], where a concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] begins. The highway runs north from the concurrent alignment shortly before it reaches [[Green Lake, Wisconsin|Green Lake]]. While running north, WIS&nbsp;49 runs through [[Berlin, Wisconsin|Berlin]] and many smaller communities before reaching an interchange at [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;10]].<ref name=gmaps1/>\n\nThe highway runs concurrently with US 10, which is a [[freeway]] for most of its length.

It runs north&ndash;south in central and southeast Wisconsin from [[Wittenberg, Wisconsin|Wittenberg]] to [[Lomira, Wisconsin|Lomira]]. The highway was initially designated in 1917, but it hadn't been extended to its current length until the 1950s.\n\n==Route description==\nHighway 93 begins at an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 41|I-41]] north of [[Lomira, Wisconsin|Lomira]] and runs west from it, passing through [[Brownsville, Wisconsin|Brownsville]] before curving to the north to meet the [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]]-[[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] county line. After an interchange with [[U.S. Route 151|US 151]], it runs through [[Waupun, Wisconsin|Waupun]]. Shortly after exiting Waupun, the highway curves and starts running north to [[Brandon, Wisconsin|Brandon]]. Shortly after exiting Brandon, the highway starts a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Wisconsin Highway 44|Highway 44]]. This concurrency ends in [[Ripon, Wisconsin|Ripon]], where a concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 23|Highway 23]] begins. The highway runs north from the concurrency alignment shortly before it reaches [[Green Lake, Wisconsin|Green Lake]]. While running north, the highway runs through [[Berlin, Wisconsin|Berlin]] and many smaller communities before reaching an interchange [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US 10]].<ref name=gmaps1/>\n\nThe highway starts a concurrency with US 10, which is a [[freeway]] for most of its length. The highway passes by [[Weyauwega, Wisconsin|Weyauwega]] and the [[Waupaca Municipal Airport]] before leaving the concurrency and running through Waupaca. After exiting Waupaca, it runs north to [[Scandinavia, Wisconsin|Scandinavia]] and then to [[Iola, Wisconsin|Iola]], where the highway enters a short concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 161|Highway 161]]. The highway then runs northwest to [[Wisconsin Highway 66|Highway 66]] before continuing north, passing through an intersection with [[Wisconsin Highway 153|Highway 153]] in [[Elderon, Wisconsin|Elderon]] before terminating at [[Wisconsin Highway 29|Highway 29]].<ref name=gmaps1/><ref name=gmaps2/>\n\n==History==\nWhen Wisconsin's State Trunk Highways were first assumed in 1917, the highway ran from WIS 23 near Green Lake to WIS 18 (By 1930, this had become US 10<ref name=1930map/>) south of Waupaca.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Wisconsin State Highway Commission |title=Official Map of the State Trunk Highway System of Wisconsin |url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/50/rec/57 |website=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=1918}}</ref> In the early 1920s, the highway was extended south to Waupun.<ref name=\"1921map\">{{cite web |author1=Wisconsin State Conservation Commission |title=Map of the state highway system of Wisconsin, showing, within red circle, location of Northern Lakes Park |url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/maps/id/946/rec/36 |website=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=c. 1921}}</ref> By 1930, the highway had been extended to its current northern terminus at WIS 29 and the highway was paved south of [[Poy Sippi, Wisconsin|Poy Sippi]] (Between WIS 21 and US 10).<ref name=\"1930map\">{{cite web |author1=Wisconisn State Highway Commission |title=Official Highway Map of Wisconsin 1930 |url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/maps/id/14135/rec/43 |website=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=1930}}</ref> In 1933, the section between Poy Sippi and US 10 was paved.<ref name=\"1933map\">{{cite web |author1=Wisconsin State Highway Commission |title=Official Highway Map of Wisconsin 1933 |url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/maps/id/14144/rec/46 |website=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=1933}}</ref> Sometime between 1948 and 1956, the highway had been extended to US 41 (now I-41<ref name=gmaps1/>).

However, the actual number of years given for the duration of the kingdom varied. In 4 Ezra 7:28-9, for example, the kingdom lasts only 400 years.\n\nThis notion of the millennium no doubt helped some Jews to cope with the socio-political conflicts that they faced.{{citation needed|date =May 2018}} This concept of the millennium served to reverse the previous period of evil and suffering,{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} rewarding the virtuous for their courage while punishing evil-doers, with a clear separation of those who are good from those who are evil.

After that, he must be let out for a little while.|{{bibleverse|Revelation|20:2-3|KJV}}}}\n\nThe Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as John's vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:\n{{quote|came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years|{{bibleverse|Revelation|20:4-6|KJV}}}}\n\nThus, [[John of Patmos]] characterizes a millennium where Christ and the Father will rule over a theocracy of the righteous. While there are an abundance of biblical references to such a kingdom of God throughout the Old and New Testaments, this is the only reference in the Bible to such a period lasting one thousand years.\n\n===Early church===\n{{Christian Eschatology}}\nDuring the first centuries after Christ, various forms of [[Premillennialism|chiliasm]] (millennialism) were to be found in the Church, both [[Eastern Church|East]] and [[Western Church|West]].<ref>''Theology Today'', January 1996, Vol. 53, No. 4, pp. 464\u2013476.

I suppose he got these ideas through a misunderstanding of the apostolic accounts, not perceiving that the things said by them were spoken mystically in figures. For he appears to have been of very limited understanding, as one can see from his discourses. But it was due to him that so many of the Church Fathers after him adopted a like opinion, urging in their own support the antiquity of the man; as for instance [[Irenaeus]] and any one else that may have proclaimed similar views.|Eusebius, ''The History of the Church'', Book 3:39:11-13<ref>{{cite book|title=Church History (Book III)|author=Eusebius|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm}}</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, strong opposition later developed from some quarters, most notably from [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Church never took a formal position on the issue at any of the [[ecumenical council]]s<nowiki/>, and thus both pro and con positions remained consistent with [[orthodoxy]]. The addition to the [[Nicene Creed]] was intended to refute the perceived [[Sabellianism]] of [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and others, a doctrine which includes an end to Christ's reign and which is explicitly singled out for condemnation by the council [Canon #1].<ref>{{citation |last1=Damick |first1=Fr.

On the other hand, \"Christian Chiliastic\" ideas were indeed advocated in 240 by [[Commodian]]; in 250 by the Egyptian [[Bishop]] [[Book of Nepos|Nepos]] in his Refutation of Allegorists; in 260 by the almost unknown [[Coracion]]; and in 310 by [[Lactantius]]. Into the late [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], Bishop [[Ambrose]] of Milan had millennial leanings (Ambrose of Milan. Book II. On the Belief in the Resurrection, verse 108).

In particular, new emphasis was placed on the passages in the [[Book of Revelation]] which seemed to say that as Christ would return to judge the living and the dead, [[Satan]] would be locked away for 1000 years, but then released on the world to instigate [[Armageddon|a final battle against God and his Saints]] ({{bibleverse|Revelation|20:1\u20136|KJV}}). Previous [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant (only the concept of the end of the world coming unexpectedly, \"like a thief in a night\", and the concept of \"the [[antichrist]]\" were almost universally held). Millennialist theories try to explain what this \"1000 years of Satan bound in chains\" would be like.\n\nVarious types of millennialism exist with regard to [[Christian eschatology]], especially within [[Protestantism]], such as [[Premillennialism]], [[Postmillennialism]], and [[Amillennialism]]. The first two refer to different views of the relationship between the \"millennial Kingdom\" and Christ's second coming.\n\nPremillennialism sees Christ's second advent as preceding the millennium, thereby separating the [[second coming]] from the [[final judgment]]. In this view, \"Christ's reign\" will be physically on the earth.\n\nPostmillennialism sees Christ's second coming as subsequent to the millennium and concurrent with the final judgment. In this view \"Christ's reign\" (during the millennium) will be spiritual in and through the [[Christian church|church]].\n\nAmillennialism basically denies a future literal 1000 year kingdom and sees the church age metaphorically described in Rev. 20:1\u20136 in which \"Christ's reign\" is current in and through the church.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] strongly condemns millennialism as the following shows:\n{{quote|The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the \"intrinsically perverse\" political form of a secular messianism.|Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger|Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1995<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church.

The Italian monk and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Joachim of Fiore]] (died 1202) claimed that all of human history was a succession of three ages:\n# the Age of the [[God the Father|Father]] (the [[Old Testament]])\n# the Age of the [[God the Son|Son]] (the [[New Testament]])\n# the Age of the [[Holy Spirit]] (the age begun when Christ ascended into heaven, leaving the [[Paraclete]], the third person of the Holy Trinity, to guide)\n\nIt was believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would begin at around 1260, and that from then on all believers would be living as monks, mystically transfigured and full of praise for God, for a thousand years until Judgment Day would put an end to the history of our planet.\n\nThe [[New Age]] movement was also highly influenced by [[Joachim of Fiore]]'s divisions of time, and transformed the Three Ages philosophy into astrological terminology. The Age of the Father was recast as the Age of Aries, the Age of the Son became the Age of Pisces, and the Age of the Holy Spirit was called the Aquarian New Age. The current so-called \"[[Age of Aquarius]]\" will supposedly witness the development of a number of great changes for humankind, reflecting the typical features of millennialism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that Christ will rule from heaven for 1,000 years as king over the earth, assisted by [[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The .27anointed.27|144,000]] holy ones.\n\n===The Church of Almighty God===\n\nAlso known as [[Eastern Lightning|Eastern Lightning, The Church of Almighty God]] mentions in its teachings the Age of Millennial Kingdom, which will follow the catastrophes prophesied in the Book of Revelation.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA15CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 | title=Lightning from the East: Heterodoxy and Christianity in Contemporary China| isbn=9789004297258| last1=Dunn| first1=Emily| date=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Baha'i Faith==\n{{See also|Progressive revelation (Baha'i)}}\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h mentioned in the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' that God will renew the \"City of God\" about every thousand years,<ref>''The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-6.html#pg199 pg. 199].</ref> and specifically mentioned that a new [[Manifestation of God]] would not appear within 1000 years (1893-2893) of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's message, but that  the authority of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's message could last up to 500,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |page= 7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}</ref><ref>''The Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-4.html#gr37 gr. 37].</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\nThe [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophist]] [[Alice Bailey]] taught that Christ (in her books she refers to the powerful spiritual being best known by Theosophists as ''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]'' as ''The Christ'' or ''The World Teacher'', not as ''Maitreya'') would return \u201csometime after AD 2025\u201d, and that this would be the [[New Age]] equivalent of the Christian concept of the [[Second Coming of Christ]].<ref>Bailey, Alice A.

Looking back at [[German history]], he distinguished two separate periods, and identified them with the ages of the 12th century Italian theologian [[Joachim of Fiore]]:\n\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (beginning with [[Charlemagne]] in AD 800) \u2013 (the \"First Reich\") \u2013 ''The Age of the [[God the Father|Father]]'' and\n*the [[German Empire]] \u2013 under the [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty (1871\u20131918) (the \"Second Reich\") \u2013 ''The Age of the [[God the Son|Son]]''.\n\nAfter the interval of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933), during which [[constitution]]alism, [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] and even [[pacifism]] ruled, these were then to be followed by:\n\n*the \"Third Reich\" \u2013 ''The Age of the [[Holy Ghost]]''.\n\nAlthough van den Bruck was unimpressed by Hitler when he met him in 1922 and did not join the [[Nazi Party]], the phrase was nevertheless adopted by the Nazis to describe the [[totalitarian state]] they wanted to set up when they gained power, which they [[Enabling Act of 1933|succeeded in doing in 1933]]. Later, however, the Nazi authorities banned the informal use of \"Third Reich\" throughout the German press in the summer of 1939, instructing it to use more official terms such as \"German Reich\", \"Greater German Reich\", and \"National Socialist Germany\" exclusively.<ref>Schmitz-Berning, Cornelia (2000).

Sometimes the two terms are used as synonyms, but this is not entirely accurate for a purist. Millennial social movements need not be religious, but they must have a vision of an [[apocalypse]] that can be utopian or [[dystopia]]n. Those who are part of millennial social movements are \"prone to be violent,\" with certain types of millennialism connected to violence. The first is progressive, where the \"transformation of the social order is gradual and humans play a role in fostering that transformation.\" The second is catastrophic millennialism which \"deems the current social order as irrevocably corrupt, and total destruction of this order is necessary as the precursor to the building of a new, godly order.\" However the link between millennialism and violence may be problematic, as new religious movements may stray from the catastrophic view as time progresses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-514986-6 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christian eschatological views]]\n* [[Christian Zionism]]\n* [[Council of Ephesus]]\n* [[Cult of the Holy Spirit]]\n* [[Immanentize the eschaton]]\n* [[Millenarianism]]\n* [[Millennial Day Theory]]\n* [[Preterism]]\n* ''[[The Pursuit of the Millennium]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barkun, Michael.

However, the actual number of years given for the duration of the kingdom varied. In 4 Ezra 7:28-9, for example, the kingdom lasts only 400 years.\n\nThis notion of the millennium no doubt helped some Jews to cope with the socio-political conflicts that they faced.{{citation needed|date =May 2018}} This concept of the millennium served to reverse the previous period of evil and suffering,{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} rewarding the virtuous for their courage while punishing evil-doers, with a clear separation of those who are good from those who are evil.

After that, he must be let out for a little while.|{{bibleverse|Revelation|20:2-3|KJV}}}}\n\nThe Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as John's vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:\n{{quote|came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years|{{bibleverse|Revelation|20:4-6|KJV}}}}\n\nThus, [[John of Patmos]] characterizes a millennium where Christ and the Father will rule over a theocracy of the righteous. While there are an abundance of biblical references to such a kingdom of God throughout the Old and New Testaments, this is the only reference in the Bible to such a period lasting one thousand years.\n\n===Early church===\n{{Christian Eschatology}}\nDuring the first centuries after Christ, various forms of [[Premillennialism|chiliasm]] (millennialism) were to be found in the Church, both [[Eastern Church|East]] and [[Western Church|West]].<ref>''Theology Today'', January 1996, Vol. 53, No. 4, pp. 464\u2013476.

I suppose he got these ideas through a misunderstanding of the apostolic accounts, not perceiving that the things said by them were spoken mystically in figures. For he appears to have been of very limited understanding, as one can see from his discourses. But it was due to him that so many of the Church Fathers after him adopted a like opinion, urging in their own support the antiquity of the man; as for instance [[Irenaeus]] and any one else that may have proclaimed similar views.|Eusebius, ''The History of the Church'', Book 3:39:11-13<ref>{{cite book|title=Church History (Book III)|author=Eusebius|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm}}</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, strong opposition later developed from some quarters, most notably from [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Church never took a formal position on the issue at any of the [[ecumenical council]]s<nowiki/>, and thus both pro and con positions remained consistent with [[orthodoxy]]. The addition to the [[Nicene Creed]] was intended to refute the perceived [[Sabellianism]] of [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and others, a doctrine which includes an end to Christ's reign and which is explicitly singled out for condemnation by the council [Canon #1].<ref>{{citation |last1=Damick |first1=Fr.

On the other hand, \"Christian Chiliastic\" ideas were indeed advocated in 240 by [[Commodian]]; in 250 by the Egyptian [[Bishop]] [[Book of Nepos|Nepos]] in his Refutation of Allegorists; in 260 by the almost unknown [[Coracion]]; and in 310 by [[Lactantius]]. Into the late [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], Bishop [[Ambrose]] of Milan had millennial leanings (Ambrose of Milan. Book II. On the Belief in the Resurrection, verse 108). [[Lactantius]] is the last great literary defender of chiliasm in the early Christian church.

In particular, new emphasis was placed on the passages in the [[Book of Revelation]] which seemed to say that as Christ would return to judge the living and the dead, [[Satan]] would be locked away for 1000 years, but then released on the world to instigate [[Armageddon|a final battle against God and his Saints]] ({{bibleverse|Revelation|20:1\u20136|KJV}}). Previous [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant (only the concept of the end of the world coming unexpectedly, \"like a thief in a night\", and the concept of \"the [[antichrist]]\" were almost universally held). Millennialist theories try to explain what this \"1000 years of Satan bound in chains\" would be like.\n\nVarious types of millennialism exist with regard to [[Christian eschatology]], especially within [[Protestantism]], such as [[Premillennialism]], [[Postmillennialism]], and [[Amillennialism]]. The first two refer to different views of the relationship between the \"millennial Kingdom\" and Christ's second coming.\n\nPremillennialism sees Christ's second advent as preceding the millennium, thereby separating the [[second coming]] from the [[final judgment]]. In this view, \"Christ's reign\" will be physically on the earth.\n\nPostmillennialism sees Christ's second coming as subsequent to the millennium and concurrent with the final judgment. In this view \"Christ's reign\" (during the millennium) will be spiritual in and through the [[Christian church|church]].\n\nAmillennialism basically denies a future literal 1000 year kingdom and sees the church age metaphorically described in Rev. 20:1\u20136 in which \"Christ's reign\" is current in and through the church.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] strongly condemns millennialism as the following shows:\n{{quote|The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the \"intrinsically perverse\" political form of a secular messianism.|Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger|Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1995<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church.

The Italian monk and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Joachim of Fiore]] (died 1202) claimed that all of human history was a succession of three ages:\n# the Age of the [[God the Father|Father]] (the [[Old Testament]])\n# the Age of the [[God the Son|Son]] (the [[New Testament]])\n# the Age of the [[Holy Spirit]] (the age begun when Christ ascended into heaven, leaving the [[Paraclete]], the third person of the Holy Trinity, to guide)\n\nIt was believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would begin at around 1260, and that from then on all believers would be living as monks, mystically transfigured and full of praise for God, for a thousand years until Judgment Day would put an end to the history of our planet.\n\nThe [[New Age]] movement was also highly influenced by [[Joachim of Fiore]]'s divisions of time, and transformed the Three Ages philosophy into astrological terminology. The Age of the Father was recast as the Age of Aries, the Age of the Son became the Age of Pisces, and the Age of the Holy Spirit was called the Aquarian New Age. The current so-called \"[[Age of Aquarius]]\" will supposedly witness the development of a number of great changes for humankind, reflecting the typical features of millennialism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that Christ will rule from heaven for 1,000 years as king over the earth, assisted by [[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The .27anointed.27|144,000]] holy ones.\n\n===The Church of Almighty God===\n\nAlso known as [[Eastern Lightning|Eastern Lightning, The Church of Almighty God]] mentions in its teachings the Age of Millennial Kingdom, which will follow the catastrophes prophesied in the Book of Revelation.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA15CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 | title=Lightning from the East: Heterodoxy and Christianity in Contemporary China| isbn=9789004297258| last1=Dunn| first1=Emily| date=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Baha'i Faith==\n{{See also|Progressive revelation (Baha'i)}}\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h mentioned in the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' that God will renew the \"City of God\" about every thousand years,<ref>''The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-6.html#pg199 pg. 199].</ref> and specifically mentioned that a new [[Manifestation of God]] would not appear within 1000 years (1893-2893) of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's message, but that  the authority of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's message could last up to 500,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |page= 7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}</ref><ref>''The Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-4.html#gr37 gr. 37].</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\nThe [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophist]] [[Alice Bailey]] taught that Christ (in her books she refers to the powerful spiritual being best known by Theosophists as ''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]'' as ''The Christ'' or ''The World Teacher'', not as ''Maitreya'') would return \u201csometime after AD 2025\u201d, and that this would be the [[New Age]] equivalent of the Christian concept of the [[Second Coming of Christ]].<ref>Bailey, Alice A.

Looking back at [[German history]], he distinguished two separate periods, and identified them with the ages of the 12th century Italian theologian [[Joachim of Fiore]]:\n\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (beginning with [[Charlemagne]] in AD 800) \u2013 (the \"First Reich\") \u2013 ''The Age of the [[God the Father|Father]]'' and\n*the [[German Empire]] \u2013 under the [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty (1871\u20131918) (the \"Second Reich\") \u2013 ''The Age of the [[God the Son|Son]]''.\n\nAfter the interval of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933), during which [[constitution]]alism, [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] and even [[pacifism]] ruled, these were then to be followed by:\n\n*the \"Third Reich\" \u2013 ''The Age of the [[Holy Ghost]]''.\n\nAlthough van den Bruck was unimpressed by Hitler when he met him in 1922 and did not join the [[Nazi Party]], the phrase was nevertheless adopted by the Nazis to describe the [[totalitarian state]] they wanted to set up when they gained power, which they [[Enabling Act of 1933|succeeded in doing in 1933]]. Later, however, the Nazi authorities banned the informal use of \"Third Reich\" throughout the German press in the summer of 1939, instructing it to use more official terms such as \"German Reich\", \"Greater German Reich\", and \"National Socialist Germany\" exclusively.<ref>Schmitz-Berning, Cornelia (2000).

Sometimes the two terms are used as synonyms, but this is not entirely accurate for a purist. Millennial social movements need not be religious, but they must have a vision of an [[apocalypse]] that can be utopian or [[dystopia]]n. Those who are part of millennial social movements are \"prone to be violent,\" with certain types of millennialism connected to violence. The first is progressive, where the \"transformation of the social order is gradual and humans play a role in fostering that transformation.\" The second is catastrophic millennialism which \"deems the current social order as irrevocably corrupt, and total destruction of this order is necessary as the precursor to the building of a new, godly order.\" However the link between millennialism and violence may be problematic, as new religious movements may stray from the catastrophic view as time progresses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-514986-6 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christian eschatological views]]\n* [[Christian Zionism]]\n* [[Council of Ephesus]]\n* [[Cult of the Holy Spirit]]\n* [[Immanentize the eschaton]]\n* [[Millenarianism]]\n* [[Millennial Day Theory]]\n* [[Preterism]]\n* ''[[The Pursuit of the Millennium]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barkun, Michael.
