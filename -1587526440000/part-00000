Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites converted to [[Christianity]], banded together and took the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gathered their weapons, buried them, and committed to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites. God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attacked them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did not attack back, instead allowed themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 had been killed, the Lamanites felt guilty and stopped attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then joined the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commanded Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they changed their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] or Ammonites.  They were given the Land of Jershon by the Nephites.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 25 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\nWhen an anti-christ named [[Korihor]] tried to teach atheism to the Ammonites, they bound him and took him to the high priest.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 30:21-29 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng</ref>\n\n===Stripling Warriors===\nIn a subsequent war between the Nephites and Lamanites, when the Ammonites saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; a Nephite prophet named [[Helaman (Book of Mormon)|Helaman]] persuaded them not to break their oath. Two thousand of their sons (who had been too young at the time to have made the pacifist covenant) volunteered to fight for the defense of the Nephites and the Ammonites.<ref name=\"Alma 53:18\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=53|verse=18}}</ref> The young men asked Helaman to be their commander.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E.

There are several speculations as to the meaning of the name:\n\n* A common interpretation is that \"Anti\" means \"Not\" instead of \"against\", rendering the name to mean \"Not descendants of Nephi, but of Lehi\".<ref>Kent P. Jackson and Darrell L. Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004).

Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W.

In both, the commandment reads, \"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\"<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6-9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites converted to [[Christianity]], banded together and took the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gathered their weapons, buried them, and committed to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites. God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attacked them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did not attack back, instead allowed themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 had been killed, the Lamanites felt guilty and stopped attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then joined the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E. Berrett wrote a critique of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as part of his study of the Book of Mormon that would become a dominant narrative for the next several decades, calling their pacifist actions, \"an interesting experiment in non-resistance\" but ultimately not effective. \"Although the Anti-Nephi-Lehies received a short respite it was not long before it became apparent that to save their lives they must flee to the land of the Nephites and be protected by Nephite arms.\"<ref>William E.

A textual clue occurs in Alma 23:5 which says the name was taken to be \"distinguished from their brethren [the Lamanites]\". There are several speculations as to the meaning of the name:\n\n* A common interpretation is that \"Anti\" means \"Not\" instead of \"against\", rendering the name to mean \"Not descendants of Nephi, but of Lehi\".<ref>Kent P. Jackson and Darrell L. Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books. e-book location 8365 of 19201</ref>\n\n\nLDS Church scholars who believe the Book of Mormon was written in [[reformed Egyptian| a language related to Egyptian]] with semitic influences suggest further potential meanings:\n\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] suggested that \"Anti\" may be a reflex of the Egyptian \"nty:\", ''he of, the one of.'' Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of the Book of Mormon, Semester 2, p. 428</ref>\n* [[John Gee]], [[Brian M.

(2010). Understanding the Book of Mormon a readers guide. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  \n\nThe language that is used when the Lord commands the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to leave the Lamanite lands and go to the Nephite lands is identical in parts to an earlier section in the Book of Mormon where a prophet [[Alma the Elder|Alma]] is commanded to take his group of Nephite slaves out of the Lamanite lands.  In both, the commandment reads, \"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\"<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6-9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1.  There is an inconsistency between the two accounts; in the first account the Lamanites are driven back after one great battle, while in the second there there are \"many battles\".<ref name=Hardy2010 />  Of the discrepancy, LDS Church Book of Mormon Scholar [[Grant Hardy]] writes that this might be an example of the narrator \"trying not to unduly burden his narrative with unnecessary details,\" and that one version is presented for historical reasons while the other is to promote a spiritual message.<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe text of the Book of Mormon notes that hundreds of the stripling warriors \"fainted because of blood\".<ref>Book of Mormon Chapter 57 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng</ref> Surgeon Robert Patterson observed of the miracle that \"the epic tale of the stripling warriors and their miraculous recovery from life-threatening trauma would appear, to the rational mind, highly unlikely or even outright impossible.
