More significantly, it led to his interest in [[natural history]], which culminated in his taking part in [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] and the eventual [[inception of Darwin's theory|inception of his theory]] of [[natural selection]]. Although [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] changed his field of interest several times in these formative years, many of his later discoveries and beliefs were foreshadowed by the influences he had as a youth.\n\n==Background and influences==\n[[File:Darwin cutout.png|thumb|[[Erasmus Darwin]], Charles Darwin's paternal grandfather, helped influence Darwin's later [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]].]]\nhe was a fat potato\n'''''Bold text'''''\nBorn in 1809, [[Charles Darwin]] grew up in a conservative era when repression of revolutionary [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] had displaced the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[Church of England]] dominated the English scientific establishment. The Church saw natural history as revealing God's underlying plan and as supporting the existing social hierarchy. It rejected Enlightenment philosophers such as [[David Hume]] who had argued for [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and against [[theism|belief in God]].\n\nThe discovery of [[fossil]]s of [[extinction|extinct]] species was explained by theories such as [[catastrophism]]. Catastrophism claimed that animals and plants were periodically annihilated as a result of natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.\n\nDarwin's [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods]] was strongly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. One of his grandfathers, [[Erasmus Darwin]], was a successful physician, and was followed in this by his sons [[Charles Darwin (1758\u20131778)|Charles Darwin]], who died while still a promising medical student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1778, and Doctor [[Robert Darwin]], Darwin's father, who named his son after his deceased brother.\n\nErasmus was a [[freethought|freethinker]] who hypothesized that all warm-blooded animals sprang from a single living \"filament\" long, long ago. He further proposed evolution by acquired characteristics, anticipating the theory later developed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]].  Although Charles was born after his grandfather Erasmus died, his father Robert found the texts an invaluable medical guide and Charles read them as a student. Doctor Robert also followed Erasmus in being a freethinker, but as a wealthy society physician was more discreet and attended the [[Church of England]] patronised by his clients.\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816, a year before the sudden loss of his mother.]]\nCharles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|the Mount]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title=The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author=John H.

He was very fond of gardening, an interest his father shared and encouraged, and would follow the family gardener around. Early in 1817, soon after becoming eight years old, he started at the small local school run by a Unitarian minister, the Reverend George Case. At home, Charles learned to ride ponies, shoot and fish. Influenced by his father's fashionable interest in [[natural history]], he tried to make out the names of plants, and was given by his father two elementary natural history books.  Childhood games included inventing and writing out complex secret codes. Charles would tell elaborate stories to his family and friends \"for the pure pleasure of attracting attention & surprise\", including hoaxes such as pretending to find apples he'd hidden earlier, and what he later called the \"monstrous fable\" which persuaded his schoolfriend that the colour of [[primula]] flowers could be changed by dosing them with special water. However, his father benignly ignored these passing games, and Charles later recounted that he stopped them because no-one paid any attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=10\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=22 22\u201324].}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1817 his mother died after the sudden onset of violent stomach pains and amidst the grief his older sisters had to take charge, with their father continuing to dominate the household whenever he returned from his doctor's rounds. To the {{frac|8|1|2}}-year-old Charles this situation was not a great change, as his mother had frequently been ill and her available time taken up by social duties, so his upbringing had largely been in the hands of his three older sisters who were nearly adults by then. In later years he had difficulty in remembering his mother, and his only memory of her death and funeral was of the children being sent for and going into her room, and his \"Father meeting us crying afterwards\".<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=18\u201320}}</ref>\n\nAs had been planned previously, in September 1818 Charles joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]] (nicknamed \"Eras\") in staying as a boarder at the [[Shrewsbury School]], where he loathed the required [[rote learning]], and would try to visit home when he could. He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in [[Wales]] brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that \"it was not right to kill insects\" for his collections, and he had to find dead ones. He read [[Gilbert White]]'s ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' and took up [[birdwatching]]. Eras took an interest in [[chemistry]] and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to [[crystallography]]. When Eras went on to a medical course at the [[University of Cambridge]], Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname \"Gas\". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a ''poco curante'' (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at [[Maer, Staffordshire|Maer]] in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the [[Wedgwood]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=23\u201334}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=46 44\u201346].}}</ref> His exasperated father once told him off, saying \"You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=28 28].}}</ref>\n\nHis father decided that he should leave school earlier than usual, and in 1825 at the age of sixteen Charles was to go along with his brother who was to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a year to obtain medical qualifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Charles spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father with treating the poor of [[Shropshire]].

The monopoly held by established medical professors was challenged by private independent schools, with new ideas of teaching by dissecting corpses giving clandestine trade to [[Body-snatching|bodysnatchers]] (just shortly before the [[Burke and Hare]] scandal).<ref name=B45-62/>\n\nHe attended the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, and found himself too sensitive to the sight of blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro ''tertius'']], and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to [[George Combe]]'s daringly [[materialism|materialist]] ideas of [[phrenology]]. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of [[Thomas Charles Hope]] were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before [[anaesthetic]]s. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.<ref name=B45-62>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=45\u201362}}</ref><ref name=auto46>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=48 46\u201348].}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers kept each other company, and made extensive use of the library. Darwin's reading included novels and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|Life of Johnson]]''. He had brought [[natural history]] books with him, including a copy of ''A Naturalist's Companion'' by [[George Graves (biologist)|George Graves]], bought in August in anticipation of seeing the seaside, and he borrowed similar books from the library. The brothers went for regular Sunday walks on the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]] and Darwin kept a diary recording their finds, which included a [[sea mouse]] and a [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=46, 49, 65\u201367}}</ref>\n\nDarwin wrote home that \"I am going to learn to stuff birds, from a [[Wiktionary:blackamoor|blackamoor]]... he only charges one guinea, for an hour every day for two months\".

In June he went on a walking tour in North Wales.\n\n===Lamarckian anatomy===\nIn his second year Charles became active in student societies for naturalists. The 21-year-old radical demagogue [[William A. F. Browne]] and the 19-year-old [[John Coldstream]] both proposed Darwin for membership of the [[Plinian Society]] on 21 November 1826.  John Coldstream came from an evangelical background and shared Darwin's fascination with sea life.  Darwin was elected to its Council on 5 December, and at the same meeting Browne presented an attack on [[Charles Bell]]'s ''Anatomy and Physiology of Expression'' (which in 1872 Darwin would target in ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'').\n\nDarwin became a keen student of [[Robert Edmond Grant]], a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] anatomist. Grant had cited [[Erasmus Darwin]] in his doctoral thesis and shared the [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] ideas of [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] on evolution by acquired characteristics. Charles joined Grant in pioneering investigations of the life cycle of [[marine invertebrate]]s on the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]].  Darwin and Grant collected tiny animals from the rock pools and walked along the rocky shore at [[Prestonpans]], where Grant lived during the winter at [[Walford House]]. Grant began taking Darwin as a guest to professor [[Robert Jameson]]'s [[Wernerian Natural History Society]]. There Charles saw [[John James Audubon]] lecturing on the habits of North American birds.<ref name=rough /><ref name=auto51/> In the April\u2013October 1826 edition of the quarterly ''[[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised \"Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day\" for having \"expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.\"<ref>[[Robert Jameson|Jameson, Robert]] ed.

Though some have attributed authorship to Jameson,<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=40}}</ref> this is hotly contested and others see Grant as having written it, as the first significant statement to relate Lamarck's concepts to the geological record of living organisms of the past.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=81}}</ref>\n\nDarwin made a discovery new to science when he observed [[cilia]] moving the microscopic larvae of a species of the [[bryozoa]]n ''[[Flustra]]''. He rushed to tell Grant, confirming Grant's belief that the larvae of these marine animals were free swimming, but was upset when Grant claimed rights to the work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR262.23.3&pageseq=1 |title=On plagiarism and scientific jealousy  |accessdate=4 March 2008 |author=Litchfield, Henrietta. nd. |authorlink= Henrietta Litchfield |year=1871 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925080113/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=CUL-DAR262.23.3&viewtype=text&pageseq=1|archivedate=25 September 2006|url-status=dead }}</ref> Darwin also made the discovery that black spores often found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]], and was disappointed when Grant announced both finds to the ''Wernerian'' on 24 March 1827 without giving Darwin credit,<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=86}}</ref> though Grant in his publication about the leech eggs in the ''Edinburgh Journal of Science'' later that year acknowledged \"The merit of having first ascertained them to belong to that animal is due to my zealous young friend Mr Charles Darwin of Shrewsbury\", the first time Darwin's name appeared in print.<ref name=leech>{{cite journal |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A144&viewtype=text&pageseq=1 |title=Notice regarding the ova of the Pontobdella muricata, Lam. |accessdate=3 March 2008 |author= Grant, R.

A furious debate ensued, and later someone deleted all mention of this [[materialism|materialist]] heresy from the minutes. This was Darwin's first exposure to militant freethought and the storm it stirred up.\n\nDuring their walks Grant expounded his ideas to Darwin, and on one occasion dropped his guard and praised Lamarck's views on evolution. He explained his radical theory of ''[[homology (biology)|homology]]'', an extension of the idea of ''unity of plan'' in vogue in Paris at the time. He argued that all animals had similar organs differing only in complexity and, controversially, that this showed their [[common descent]]. Grant had announced to the ''Wernerian'' his identification of the pancreas in a pinned-out sea-slug, showing an organ molluscs shared with mammals. He assumed that as the earth cooled, changing conditions drove life towards higher, hotter blooded forms, as shown by a progressive sequence of fossils, and that study of eggs of the simplest creatures would help reveal ''[[Unicellular organism|monad]]s'', elementary living particles. While this showed that naturalists could try to \"lift the veil that hangs over the origin and progress of the organic world\", Darwin was troubled by Grant's [[atheism]] and could see that [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] was far from respectable.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=39\u201341}}</ref> Darwin later recalled \"I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I can judge, without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the Zo\u00f6nomia of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but without producing any effect on me.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=51 49]}}</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards Coldstream graduated and went to Paris for his hospital study, where he suffered a [[mental breakdown]], struggling with \"the foul mass of corruption within my own bosom\", held captive to his body by \"corroding desires\" and \"lustful imaginations\". The doctor's report was that though Coldstream had led \"a blameless life\", he was \"more or less in the dark on the vital question of religion, and was troubled with doubts arising from certain Materialist views, which are, alas!, too common among medical students\".<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=87}}<br>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Geology and ''Origin of the Species''===\nDarwin also took the popular natural history course of Professor [[Robert Jameson]], learning about [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] geology. Jameson was a [[Neptunism|Neptunian]] geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor [[Thomas Charles Hope]] who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas influenced by the [[Plutonism]] of [[James Hutton]] who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that \"It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting.\" Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the ''\"Origin of the Species of Animals\"''. Darwin enjoyed practicals in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The [[Royal Museum|Museum of Edinburgh University]] was Jameson's preserve and was then one of the largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens.\n\nEven medical lectures proved of some use. In January 1826 Darwin had written home complaining of \"a long stupid lecture\" from Dr. Andrew Duncan ''secundus'' about medicine, but the lectures introduced him to [[Augustin de Candolle]]'s ''natural system'' of classification and emphasis on the \"war\" between competing species. However, he loathed medicine and left in April 1827 without a degree.\n\nHe toured Scotland, went on to [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] and in May made his first trip to London to visit his sister Caroline. They joined his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] on a trip to France. There Charles fended for himself for a few weeks in Paris with Browne and Coldstream who was recovering having \"found joy and peace in believing\". Charles rejoined his relations and then returned to his home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]] by July.\n\n==University of Cambridge==\n[[File:Christs shield.png|thumb|right|175px|The coat of arms of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], a college of the [[University of Cambridge]] where Darwin was enrolled to become a clergyman.]]\n\nHis father was unhappy that his younger son would not become a physician and \"was very properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which then seemed my probable destination.\" He therefore enrolled Charles at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1827 for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the qualification required before taking a specialised divinity course and becoming an Anglican [[parson]]. He enrolled for an ''[[British undergraduate degree classification|ordinary]]'' degree, as at that time only capable mathematicians would take the [[Tripos]].<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=89\u201391}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=58 56_57]}}</ref><ref name=JvW>{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}</ref> At that time the only way to get an honours degree was the mathematical Tripos examination, or the classical Tripos created in 1822, which was only open to those who already had high honours in mathematics, or those who were the sons of [[Peerage|peers]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, Jonathan C. |title=Teaching and learning in nineteenth-century Cambridge |publisher=Boydell Press |location=Ipswich |year=2002 |page=207 |isbn=0-85115-783-1 }}</ref>\n\nThis was a respectable career for a gentleman at a time when most naturalists in England were clergymen in the tradition of [[Gilbert White]], who saw it as part of their duties to \"explore the wonders of God's creation\". Charles had concerns about being able to declare his belief in all the dogmas of the [[Church of England]], so as well as hunting and fishing, he studied [[divinity]] books. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. [[John Bird Sumner]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''.  John Bird Summer wrote that Jesus's religion was \"wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world\" and there was \"no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability.\" His Classics had lapsed since school, and he spent the autumn term at home studying Greek with a tutor. Darwin was accepted as a \"pensioner\", having paid his fees, on 15 October 1827, but did not attend Cambridge until the Lent Term which began on 13 January 1828. Eras returned from Edinburgh ready to sit his [[Bachelor of Medicine]] exam, and in the new year he and Charles set out together for Cambridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=47\u201349}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_Christs.html |title=Darwin Online: The Admissions books of Christ's College, Cambridge |accessdate=20 December 2008}}<br>{{acad|id=DRWN827CR|name=Darwin, Charles Robert}}</ref> Darwin came into residence in Cambridge on 26 January 1828, and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the University's Senate House on 26 February.<ref name=JvW/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/7958710.stm|title=Darwin's 'gentleman' student days|author=Anonymous|date=23 March 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nHis tutors at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] were to include [[Joseph Shaw (Christ's College)|Joseph Shaw]] in 1828, [[John Graham (bishop)|John Graham]] (in 1829 \u2013 1830) and [[Edward John Ash]] in 1830 \u2013 1831.

No rooms were available at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], so he took lodgings above a [[tobacconists]] in Sidney Street, across the road.  Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of [[beetle]]s. Trainee clergymen scoured [[Cambridgeshire]] for specimens, referring to ''An Introduction to [[Entomology]]'' by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]] and [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]]. Charles joined his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable.  They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about [[natural history]] from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a [[ground beetle]] in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle,  ''[[Panagaeus cruxmajor]]''.

Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the [[John Stevens Henslow|Revd.

Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the [[Adam Sedgwick|Revd. Adam Sedgwick]] and the new [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] the [[William Whewell|Revd.

Darwin joined other Cambridge friends on a three-month \"reading party\" at [[Barmouth]] on the coast of [[Wales]] to revise their studies with private tutors. For Charles it was an \"Entomo-Mathematical expedition\". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as [[hillwalking]], boating and [[fly fishing]]. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student [[John Maurice Herbert]] who he dubbed \"Cherbury\" after [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Herbert of Cherbury]], the father of English [[Deism]]. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say \"Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do.\"<ref name=francis166>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.1&pageseq=184 176\u2013171]}}</ref> In September Darwin wrote to tell \"My dear old ''Cherbury''\" that his own catches had included \"some of the rarest of the British Insects, & their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write & inform some of the crack Entomologists.\" He described these ''\"extremely rare\"'' insects and asked Herbert to oblige him by collecting some more of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-47 |title=Letter 47 \u2013 Darwin, C.

He now had breakfast every day with his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]]. This was Fox's last term before his BA exam, and he now had to cram desperately to make up for lost time. At the Christmas holiday Charles visited London with Eras, toured the scientific institutions \"where Naturalists are gregarious\" and through his friend the Revd. [[Frederick William Hope]] met other insect collectors. These included [[James Francis Stephens|James Stephens]], author of ''Illustrations of British Entomology\".\n\nThe January term brought miserable weather and a struggle to keep up with his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with [[John Maurice Herbert|John Herbert]] about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, \"Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit\". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied \"Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take orders\" to become an ordained priest.<ref name=francis166/> Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent \"debauch\". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and \"rode like incarnate devils\" eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back at two in the morning and violated curfew. He was risking \"[[rustication (academia)|rustication]]\", temporary expulsion. Such behaviour would be noticed by the [[Proctor]]s, university officials appointed from the colleges who patrolled the town in plain gowns to police the students.\n\nStudent resentment against two unpopular Proctors built up, and on 9 April 1829 a tumult broke out. Charles described how the Senior Proctor was \"most gloriously hissed.. & pelted with mud\", being \"driven so furious\" that his servant \"dared not go near him for an hour.\"<ref name=Letter61>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-61 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 61 \u2013 Darwin, C.

Outraged by this leniency, the Proctors quit ''en masse'' and printed their resignation to post up around the colleges. Though the unpopular Proctors were gone, Charles was jolted into thinking of the consequences of [[Theory of criminal justice|law-breaking]].\n\nIn the Spring, Darwin enrolled for [[John Stevens Henslow]]'s lectures on [[botany]]. Professor Henslow's first \"public herborizing expedition\" of the year took place in May, an outing on which students assisted with collection of plants. However, Darwin made no mention of Henslow in his letters to Fox.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=70, 76}}</ref> On 18 May Darwin wrote to Fox enthusing about his success with beetle collecting, \"I think I beat Jenyns in Colymbetes\", contrasted with his lack of application to studies: \"my time is solely occupied in riding & Entomologizing\".<ref name=\"Letter 64\">{{Cite web  | title = Letter 64 &#8212; Darwin, C.

Home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]], he saw his brother Erasmus whose \"delicate frame\" led to him now giving up medicine and retiring at the age of 26. The brothers visited the [[History of Birmingham|Birmingham]] Music Festival for what Charles described as the \"most glorious\" experience.\n\n===Third year, theology and natural history===\nBack at Cambridge, Charles studied hard for his ''Little Go'' preliminary exam, as a fail would mean a re-sit the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]]'s Friday evening soir\u00e9es. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'', becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was \"convinced that I could have written out the whole of the ''Evidences'' with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley.\" Later, on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]], he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established \"a future state of reward and punishment\" which \"gives order for confusion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural\". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the [[New Testament]] and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 76\u201379}}</ref><ref name=dar57>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=59 57\u201367]}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of his friends celebrated their examination successes by dining in each other's rooms in rotation in a weekly club commonly known as the ''Glutton Club''. This name was proposed to ridicule another group whose Greek title meant \"fond of dainties\", but who dined out on \"Mutton Chops, or Beans & Bacon\". The ''Glutton Club'' attempted to live up to their title by experimentally dining on \"birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate\" and tried hawk and [[bittern]], but gave up after eating an old brown owl, \"which was indescribable\". They had more amusement from concluding each meeting with \"a game of mild [[Blackjack|vingt-et-un]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=CUL-DAR112.B57-B76&pageseq=14 |title= (Recollections of Darwin at Cambridge) CUL-DAR112.B57-B76 |author=Herbert, John Maurice |date= 2 June 1882 |publisher=Darwin Online |pages=70\u201372 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.1&pageseq=187 169\u2013170]}}<br>{{harvnb|Freeman|1978|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A27&pageseq=159 152]}}</ref>\n\nOver Easter Charles stayed at Cambridge, mounting and cataloguing his beetle collection. He then became an enthusiastic member of the [[botany]] course which the \"good natured & agreeable\" professor Henslow taught five days a week in the Botanic Gardens and on field trips. Henslow's outings were attended by 78 men including professor Whewell. Charles became the \"favourite pupil\", known as \"the man who walks with Henslow\", helping to find specimens and to set up \"practicals\" dissecting plants. He became interested in pollen. One day he watched through a microscope and saw \"transparent cones\" emerge from the side of a [[geranium]] pollen grain. Then one burst spraying out \"numberless granules\". Henslow explained that the granules were indeed the constituent atoms of pollen, but they had no intrinsic vital power \u2013 life was endowed from outside and ultimately derived its power from God, whatever more \"speculative\" naturalists argued regarding self-activating power. Darwin had been taught otherwise by Grant, and reflected quietly on this, biding his time.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 80\u201382}}</ref>\n\nFor the summer holidays Darwin arranged to meet Fox at The Mount, but Darwin's father had been ill and family tensions led to a row. Charles went off with the Revd. Hope and other friends for three weeks \"entomologizing\" in North Wales, hunting for beetles and trout fishing. He went partridge shooting at Maer before returning home.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 82\u201383}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth year finals and later attitude towards mathematics ===\nBack at Cambridge, his final exams loomed. A \"desperate\" Charles focused on his studies and got private tuition from Henslow whose subjects were mathematics and theology. This term he had to study [[Euclid]] and learn Paley's ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', though this old text was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only \"expediency\".  Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society.  The judgement was \"Every man for himself\". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas. At this time the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government. In response, radical street protests demanded [[suffrage]], [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom of religion]].  Then in November the Tory administration collapsed and the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] took over. Paley's text even supported abolition of the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Anglican]] faith'' which every student at Cambridge (and [[Oxford University]]) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that \"he should be grieved if a single word... was altered\" and emphasised the need to respect authority.  This happened even as campaigns of civil disobedience spread to starving agricultural labourers and villages close to Cambridge suffered riots and arson attacks.\n\nIn the third week of January 1831 Charles sat his final exam.  There were three days of written papers covering the Classics, the two Paley texts and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', then mathematics and physics. At the end of the week when the results were posted he was dazed and proud to have come 10th out of a pass list of 178 doing the ''ordinary'' degree. Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox \"I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=87\u201388}}</ref> In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and \"By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the [[Hoi polloi#Appearances in the nineteenth century|\u03bf\u1f31 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af]], or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.\"<ref name=dar57 />\n\nOn the specific issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret his lack of ability and application: \"I attempted mathematics, and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense\".<ref>[http://www.turtlereader.com/authors/charles-darwin/the-life-and-letters-of-charles-darwin-day-13-of-188/ Darwin Correspondence Cambridge 1828\u20131831]</ref>\n\n===Natural theology and geology===\n[[File:Young-Charles-Darwin-statue-by-Anthony-Smith-(Christ's-College-Cambridge)-3.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Darwin during his last months at Christ's College (age 22).

He resumed his beetle collecting, took career advice from Henslow, and read [[William Paley]]'s ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' which set out to refute [[David Hume]]'s argument that [[Teleological argument|\"design\" by a Creator]] was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect [[adaptation]] to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]] as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Paley|1809|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=437 431\u2013433], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=462 456].}}</ref> Paley's benevolent God acted in nature though uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a [[theodicy]] explaining the [[problem of evil]] by separating nature from direct divine action.

More significantly, it led to his interest in [[natural history]], which culminated in his taking part in [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] and the eventual [[inception of Darwin's theory|inception of his theory]] of [[natural selection]]. Although [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] changed his field of interest several times in these formative years, many of his later discoveries and beliefs were foreshadowed by the influences he had as a youth.\n\n==Background and influences==\n[[File:Darwin cutout.png|thumb|[[Erasmus Darwin]], Charles Darwin's paternal grandfather, helped influence Darwin's later [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]].]]\n\nBorn in 1809, [[Charles Darwin]] grew up in a conservative era when repression of revolutionary [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] had displaced the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[Church of England]] dominated the English scientific establishment. The Church saw natural history as revealing God's underlying plan and as supporting the existing social hierarchy. It rejected Enlightenment philosophers such as [[David Hume]] who had argued for [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and against [[theism|belief in God]].\n\nThe discovery of [[fossil]]s of [[extinction|extinct]] species was explained by theories such as [[catastrophism]]. Catastrophism claimed that animals and plants were periodically annihilated as a result of natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.\n\nDarwin's [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods]] was strongly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. One of his grandfathers, [[Erasmus Darwin]], was a successful physician, and was followed in this by his sons [[Charles Darwin (1758\u20131778)|Charles Darwin]], who died while still a promising medical student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1778, and Doctor [[Robert Darwin]], Darwin's father, who named his son after his deceased brother.\n\nErasmus was a [[freethought|freethinker]] who hypothesized that all warm-blooded animals sprang from a single living \"filament\" long, long ago. He further proposed evolution by acquired characteristics, anticipating the theory later developed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]].  Although Charles was born after his grandfather Erasmus died, his father Robert found the texts an invaluable medical guide and Charles read them as a student. Doctor Robert also followed Erasmus in being a freethinker, but as a wealthy society physician was more discreet and attended the [[Church of England]] patronised by his clients.\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816, a year before the sudden loss of his mother.]]\nCharles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|the Mount]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title=The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author=John H.

He was very fond of gardening, an interest his father shared and encouraged, and would follow the family gardener around. Early in 1817, soon after becoming eight years old, he started at the small local school run by a Unitarian minister, the Reverend George Case. At home, Charles learned to ride ponies, shoot and fish. Influenced by his father's fashionable interest in [[natural history]], he tried to make out the names of plants, and was given by his father two elementary natural history books.  Childhood games included inventing and writing out complex secret codes. Charles would tell elaborate stories to his family and friends \"for the pure pleasure of attracting attention & surprise\", including hoaxes such as pretending to find apples he'd hidden earlier, and what he later called the \"monstrous fable\" which persuaded his schoolfriend that the colour of [[primula]] flowers could be changed by dosing them with special water. However, his father benignly ignored these passing games, and Charles later recounted that he stopped them because no-one paid any attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=10\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=22 22\u201324].}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1817 his mother died after the sudden onset of violent stomach pains and amidst the grief his older sisters had to take charge, with their father continuing to dominate the household whenever he returned from his doctor's rounds. To the {{frac|8|1|2}}-year-old Charles this situation was not a great change, as his mother had frequently been ill and her available time taken up by social duties, so his upbringing had largely been in the hands of his three older sisters who were nearly adults by then. In later years he had difficulty in remembering his mother, and his only memory of her death and funeral was of the children being sent for and going into her room, and his \"Father meeting us crying afterwards\".<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=18\u201320}}</ref>\n\nAs had been planned previously, in September 1818 Charles joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]] (nicknamed \"Eras\") in staying as a boarder at the [[Shrewsbury School]], where he loathed the required [[rote learning]], and would try to visit home when he could. He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in [[Wales]] brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that \"it was not right to kill insects\" for his collections, and he had to find dead ones. He read [[Gilbert White]]'s ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' and took up [[birdwatching]]. Eras took an interest in [[chemistry]] and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to [[crystallography]]. When Eras went on to a medical course at the [[University of Cambridge]], Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname \"Gas\". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a ''poco curante'' (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at [[Maer, Staffordshire|Maer]] in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the [[Wedgwood]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=23\u201334}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=46 44\u201346].}}</ref> His exasperated father once told him off, saying \"You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=28 28].}}</ref>\n\nHis father decided that he should leave school earlier than usual, and in 1825 at the age of sixteen Charles was to go along with his brother who was to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a year to obtain medical qualifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Charles spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father with treating the poor of [[Shropshire]].

Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to [[George Combe]]'s daringly [[materialism|materialist]] ideas of [[phrenology]]. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of [[Thomas Charles Hope]] were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before [[anaesthetic]]s.

Darwin's reading included novels and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|Life of Johnson]]''. He had brought [[natural history]] books with him, including a copy of ''A Naturalist's Companion'' by [[George Graves (biologist)|George Graves]], bought in August in anticipation of seeing the seaside, and he borrowed similar books from the library.

In June he went on a walking tour in North Wales.\n\n===Lamarckian anatomy===\nIn his second year Charles became active in student societies for naturalists. The 21-year-old radical demagogue [[William A. F. Browne]] and the 19-year-old [[John Coldstream]] both proposed Darwin for membership of the [[Plinian Society]] on 21 November 1826.  John Coldstream came from an evangelical background and shared Darwin's fascination with sea life.  Darwin was elected to its Council on 5 December, and at the same meeting Browne presented an attack on [[Charles Bell]]'s ''Anatomy and Physiology of Expression'' (which in 1872 Darwin would target in ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'').\n\nDarwin became a keen student of [[Robert Edmond Grant]], a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] anatomist. Grant had cited [[Erasmus Darwin]] in his doctoral thesis and shared the [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] ideas of [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] on evolution by acquired characteristics. Charles joined Grant in pioneering investigations of the life cycle of [[marine invertebrate]]s on the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]].  Darwin and Grant collected tiny animals from the rock pools and walked along the rocky shore at [[Prestonpans]], where Grant lived during the winter at [[Walford House]]. Grant began taking Darwin as a guest to professor [[Robert Jameson]]'s [[Wernerian Natural History Society]]. There Charles saw [[John James Audubon]] lecturing on the habits of North American birds.<ref name=rough /><ref name=auto51/> In the April\u2013October 1826 edition of the quarterly ''[[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised \"Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day\" for having \"expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.\"<ref>[[Robert Jameson|Jameson, Robert]] ed.

Though some have attributed authorship to Jameson,<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=40}}</ref> this is hotly contested and others see Grant as having written it, as the first significant statement to relate Lamarck's concepts to the geological record of living organisms of the past.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=81}}</ref>\n\nDarwin made a discovery new to science when he observed [[cilia]] moving the microscopic larvae of a species of the [[bryozoa]]n ''[[Flustra]]''.

A furious debate ensued, and later someone deleted all mention of this [[materialism|materialist]] heresy from the minutes. This was Darwin's first exposure to militant freethought and the storm it stirred up.\n\nDuring their walks Grant expounded his ideas to Darwin, and on one occasion dropped his guard and praised Lamarck's views on evolution. He explained his radical theory of ''[[homology (biology)|homology]]'', an extension of the idea of ''unity of plan'' in vogue in Paris at the time. He argued that all animals had similar organs differing only in complexity and, controversially, that this showed their [[common descent]]. Grant had announced to the ''Wernerian'' his identification of the pancreas in a pinned-out sea-slug, showing an organ molluscs shared with mammals. He assumed that as the earth cooled, changing conditions drove life towards higher, hotter blooded forms, as shown by a progressive sequence of fossils, and that study of eggs of the simplest creatures would help reveal ''[[Unicellular organism|monad]]s'', elementary living particles. While this showed that naturalists could try to \"lift the veil that hangs over the origin and progress of the organic world\", Darwin was troubled by Grant's [[atheism]] and could see that [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] was far from respectable.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=39\u201341}}</ref> Darwin later recalled \"I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I can judge, without any effect on my mind.

The doctor's report was that though Coldstream had led \"a blameless life\", he was \"more or less in the dark on the vital question of religion, and was troubled with doubts arising from certain Materialist views, which are, alas!, too common among medical students\".<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=87}}<br>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Geology and ''Origin of the Species''===\nDarwin also took the popular natural history course of Professor [[Robert Jameson]], learning about [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] geology. Jameson was a [[Neptunism|Neptunian]] geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor [[Thomas Charles Hope]] who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas influenced by the [[Plutonism]] of [[James Hutton]] who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that \"It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting.\" Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the ''\"Origin of the Species of Animals\"''. Darwin enjoyed practicals in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The [[Royal Museum|Museum of Edinburgh University]] was Jameson's preserve and was then one of the largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens.\n\nEven medical lectures proved of some use. In January 1826 Darwin had written home complaining of \"a long stupid lecture\" from Dr. Andrew Duncan ''secundus'' about medicine, but the lectures introduced him to [[Augustin de Candolle]]'s ''natural system'' of classification and emphasis on the \"war\" between competing species. However, he loathed medicine and left in April 1827 without a degree.\n\nHe toured Scotland, went on to [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] and in May made his first trip to London to visit his sister Caroline. They joined his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] on a trip to France. There Charles fended for himself for a few weeks in Paris with Browne and Coldstream who was recovering having \"found joy and peace in believing\". Charles rejoined his relations and then returned to his home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]] by July.\n\n==University of Cambridge==\n[[File:Christs shield.png|thumb|right|175px|The coat of arms of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], a college of the [[University of Cambridge]] where Darwin was enrolled to become a clergyman.]]\n\nHis father was unhappy that his younger son would not become a physician and \"was very properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which then seemed my probable destination.\" He therefore enrolled Charles at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1827 for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the qualification required before taking a specialised divinity course and becoming an Anglican [[parson]]. He enrolled for an ''[[British undergraduate degree classification|ordinary]]'' degree, as at that time only capable mathematicians would take the [[Tripos]].<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=89\u201391}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=58 56_57]}}</ref><ref name=JvW>{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}</ref> At that time the only way to get an honours degree was the mathematical Tripos examination, or the classical Tripos created in 1822, which was only open to those who already had high honours in mathematics, or those who were the sons of [[Peerage|peers]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, Jonathan C. |title=Teaching and learning in nineteenth-century Cambridge |publisher=Boydell Press |location=Ipswich |year=2002 |page=207 |isbn=0-85115-783-1 }}</ref>\n\nThis was a respectable career for a gentleman at a time when most naturalists in England were clergymen in the tradition of [[Gilbert White]], who saw it as part of their duties to \"explore the wonders of God's creation\". Charles had concerns about being able to declare his belief in all the dogmas of the [[Church of England]], so as well as hunting and fishing, he studied [[divinity]] books. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. [[John Bird Sumner]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''.  John Bird Summer wrote that Jesus's religion was \"wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world\" and there was \"no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability.\" His Classics had lapsed since school, and he spent the autumn term at home studying Greek with a tutor. Darwin was accepted as a \"pensioner\", having paid his fees, on 15 October 1827, but did not attend Cambridge until the Lent Term which began on 13 January 1828. Eras returned from Edinburgh ready to sit his [[Bachelor of Medicine]] exam, and in the new year he and Charles set out together for Cambridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=47\u201349}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_Christs.html |title=Darwin Online: The Admissions books of Christ's College, Cambridge |accessdate=20 December 2008}}<br>{{acad|id=DRWN827CR|name=Darwin, Charles Robert}}</ref> Darwin came into residence in Cambridge on 26 January 1828, and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the University's Senate House on 26 February.<ref name=JvW/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/7958710.stm|title=Darwin's 'gentleman' student days|author=Anonymous|date=23 March 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nHis tutors at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] were to include [[Joseph Shaw (Christ's College)|Joseph Shaw]] in 1828, [[John Graham (bishop)|John Graham]] (in 1829 \u2013 1830) and [[Edward John Ash]] in 1830 \u2013 1831.

No rooms were available at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], so he took lodgings above a [[tobacconists]] in Sidney Street, across the road.  Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of [[beetle]]s. Trainee clergymen scoured [[Cambridgeshire]] for specimens, referring to ''An Introduction to [[Entomology]]'' by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]] and [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]]. Charles joined his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable.  They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about [[natural history]] from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a [[ground beetle]] in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle,  ''[[Panagaeus cruxmajor]]''. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=59}} describes the incident and states that the insect Darwin popped into his mouth was a [[bombardier beetle]].<br>*They cite Darwin's correspondence and his ''Autobiography'' ({{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=64 62\u201363].}})<br>*{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/young/lifelong.php |title=Darwin: Young Naturalist |work=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=12 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221210143/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/young/lifelong.php |archivedate=21 December 2010  }} quotes the ''Autobiography'', and while its illustration shows a bombardier beetle, it says \"Many beetles, including the ''[[Brachinus crepitans]]'' and the ''[[Stenaptinus insignis]]'', release irritating chemicals as a defense.\"<br>*[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-1009 Letter 1009 \u2013 Darwin, C.

Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the [[John Stevens Henslow|Revd. John Stevens Henslow]], professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soir\u00e9es, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the [[Adam Sedgwick|Revd. Adam Sedgwick]] and the new [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] the [[William Whewell|Revd. William Whewell]].\n\nIn the summer Darwin paid visits to Squire Owen, and romance seemed to be blossoming with the squire's daughter Fanny. Darwin joined other Cambridge friends on a three-month \"reading party\" at [[Barmouth]] on the coast of [[Wales]] to revise their studies with private tutors. For Charles it was an \"Entomo-Mathematical expedition\". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as [[hillwalking]], boating and [[fly fishing]]. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student [[John Maurice Herbert]] who he dubbed \"Cherbury\" after [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Herbert of Cherbury]], the father of English [[Deism]]. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say \"Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do.\"<ref name=francis166>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.1&pageseq=184 176\u2013171]}}</ref> In September Darwin wrote to tell \"My dear old ''Cherbury''\" that his own catches had included \"some of the rarest of the British Insects, & their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write & inform some of the crack Entomologists.\" He described these ''\"extremely rare\"'' insects and asked Herbert to oblige him by collecting some more of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-47 |title=Letter 47 \u2013 Darwin, C.

He now had breakfast every day with his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]]. This was Fox's last term before his BA exam, and he now had to cram desperately to make up for lost time. At the Christmas holiday Charles visited London with Eras, toured the scientific institutions \"where Naturalists are gregarious\" and through his friend the Revd. [[Frederick William Hope]] met other insect collectors. These included [[James Francis Stephens|James Stephens]], author of ''Illustrations of British Entomology\".\n\nThe January term brought miserable weather and a struggle to keep up with his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with [[John Maurice Herbert|John Herbert]] about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, \"Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit\". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied \"Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take orders\" to become an ordained priest.<ref name=francis166/> Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent \"debauch\". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and \"rode like incarnate devils\" eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back at two in the morning and violated curfew. He was risking \"[[rustication (academia)|rustication]]\", temporary expulsion. Such behaviour would be noticed by the [[Proctor]]s, university officials appointed from the colleges who patrolled the town in plain gowns to police the students.\n\nStudent resentment against two unpopular Proctors built up, and on 9 April 1829 a tumult broke out. Charles described how the Senior Proctor was \"most gloriously hissed.. & pelted with mud\", being \"driven so furious\" that his servant \"dared not go near him for an hour.\"<ref name=Letter61>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-61 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 61 \u2013 Darwin, C.

Outraged by this leniency, the Proctors quit ''en masse'' and printed their resignation to post up around the colleges. Though the unpopular Proctors were gone, Charles was jolted into thinking of the consequences of [[Theory of criminal justice|law-breaking]].\n\nIn the Spring, Darwin enrolled for [[John Stevens Henslow]]'s lectures on [[botany]]. Professor Henslow's first \"public herborizing expedition\" of the year took place in May, an outing on which students assisted with collection of plants. However, Darwin made no mention of Henslow in his letters to Fox.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=70, 76}}</ref> On 18 May Darwin wrote to Fox enthusing about his success with beetle collecting, \"I think I beat Jenyns in Colymbetes\", contrasted with his lack of application to studies: \"my time is solely occupied in riding & Entomologizing\".<ref name=\"Letter 64\">{{Cite web  | title = Letter 64 &#8212; Darwin, C.

Home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]], he saw his brother Erasmus whose \"delicate frame\" led to him now giving up medicine and retiring at the age of 26. The brothers visited the [[History of Birmingham|Birmingham]] Music Festival for what Charles described as the \"most glorious\" experience.\n\n===Third year, theology and natural history===\nBack at Cambridge, Charles studied hard for his ''Little Go'' preliminary exam, as a fail would mean a re-sit the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]]'s Friday evening soir\u00e9es. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'', becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was \"convinced that I could have written out the whole of the ''Evidences'' with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley.\" Later, on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]], he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established \"a future state of reward and punishment\" which \"gives order for confusion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural\". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the [[New Testament]] and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 76\u201379}}</ref><ref name=dar57>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=59 57\u201367]}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of his friends celebrated their examination successes by dining in each other's rooms in rotation in a weekly club commonly known as the ''Glutton Club''. This name was proposed to ridicule another group whose Greek title meant \"fond of dainties\", but who dined out on \"Mutton Chops, or Beans & Bacon\". The ''Glutton Club'' attempted to live up to their title by experimentally dining on \"birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate\" and tried hawk and [[bittern]], but gave up after eating an old brown owl, \"which was indescribable\". They had more amusement from concluding each meeting with \"a game of mild [[Blackjack|vingt-et-un]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=CUL-DAR112.B57-B76&pageseq=14 |title= (Recollections of Darwin at Cambridge) CUL-DAR112.B57-B76 |author=Herbert, John Maurice |date= 2 June 1882 |publisher=Darwin Online |pages=70\u201372 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.1&pageseq=187 169\u2013170]}}<br>{{harvnb|Freeman|1978|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A27&pageseq=159 152]}}</ref>\n\nOver Easter Charles stayed at Cambridge, mounting and cataloguing his beetle collection. He then became an enthusiastic member of the [[botany]] course which the \"good natured & agreeable\" professor Henslow taught five days a week in the Botanic Gardens and on field trips. Henslow's outings were attended by 78 men including professor Whewell. Charles became the \"favourite pupil\", known as \"the man who walks with Henslow\", helping to find specimens and to set up \"practicals\" dissecting plants. He became interested in pollen. One day he watched through a microscope and saw \"transparent cones\" emerge from the side of a [[geranium]] pollen grain. Then one burst spraying out \"numberless granules\". Henslow explained that the granules were indeed the constituent atoms of pollen, but they had no intrinsic vital power \u2013 life was endowed from outside and ultimately derived its power from God, whatever more \"speculative\" naturalists argued regarding self-activating power. Darwin had been taught otherwise by Grant, and reflected quietly on this, biding his time.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 80\u201382}}</ref>\n\nFor the summer holidays Darwin arranged to meet Fox at The Mount, but Darwin's father had been ill and family tensions led to a row. Charles went off with the Revd. Hope and other friends for three weeks \"entomologizing\" in North Wales, hunting for beetles and trout fishing. He went partridge shooting at Maer before returning home.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 82\u201383}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth year finals and later attitude towards mathematics ===\nBack at Cambridge, his final exams loomed. A \"desperate\" Charles focused on his studies and got private tuition from Henslow whose subjects were mathematics and theology. This term he had to study [[Euclid]] and learn Paley's ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', though this old text was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only \"expediency\".  Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society.  The judgement was \"Every man for himself\". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas. At this time the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government. In response, radical street protests demanded [[suffrage]], [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom of religion]].  Then in November the Tory administration collapsed and the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] took over. Paley's text even supported abolition of the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Anglican]] faith'' which every student at Cambridge (and [[Oxford University]]) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that \"he should be grieved if a single word... was altered\" and emphasised the need to respect authority.  This happened even as campaigns of civil disobedience spread to starving agricultural labourers and villages close to Cambridge suffered riots and arson attacks.\n\nIn the third week of January 1831 Charles sat his final exam.  There were three days of written papers covering the Classics, the two Paley texts and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', then mathematics and physics. At the end of the week when the results were posted he was dazed and proud to have come 10th out of a pass list of 178 doing the ''ordinary'' degree. Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox \"I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=87\u201388}}</ref> In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and \"By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the [[Hoi polloi#Appearances in the nineteenth century|\u03bf\u1f31 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af]], or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.\"<ref name=dar57 />\n\nOn the specific issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret his lack of ability and application: \"I attempted mathematics, and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense\".<ref>[http://www.turtlereader.com/authors/charles-darwin/the-life-and-letters-of-charles-darwin-day-13-of-188/ Darwin Correspondence Cambridge 1828\u20131831]</ref>\n\n===Natural theology and geology===\n[[File:Young-Charles-Darwin-statue-by-Anthony-Smith-(Christ's-College-Cambridge)-3.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Darwin during his last months at Christ's College (age 22).

Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367).

The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit Bishops or the Pope.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, \"Eastern Christianity in India\"</ref> Church historian KOOTHUR observes that \"the \u2018Coonan Cross\u2019 revolution obviously was the final outbreak of the storm that had been gathering on the horizon of the ecclesial life of the St. Thomas Christians for over a century.\"\n\nRome sent Carmelites in two groups from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propagation of the Faith]] to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of [[Kodungallur|Cranganore]], before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367). Latin Catholic Carmelite clergy from Europe served as bishops, and the Church along with the Latin Catholics was under the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of Malabar (modern-day [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly]]). As per [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]]'s travelogue [[Varthamanappusthakam]] (dated to 1790), the Church was known then as the ''Malankare Kaldaya Suriyani Sabha'' \"Malankara Chaldean Syriac Church\". In 1887, the Holy See established two [[Apostolic Vicariate]]s, [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]] and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Kottayam]] (later Changanassery) under the guidance of indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops, and named the Church as \"The Syro-Malabar Church\" to distinguish them from the Latins.<ref name=\"Nedumparambil\">{{cite web|author=George Joseph Nedumparambil|date=2013|title=A Search of the Roots of the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala|url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/opus4-wuerzburg/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6595/file/Joseph_Nedumparambil.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2019|publisher=University of W\u00fcrzburg}}</ref> The Holy See re-organized the Apostolic Vicariates in 1896 into three Apostolic Vicariates ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam]], and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Changanassery]]). A fourth Apostolic Vicariate ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam|Kottayam]]) was established in 1911 for [[Knanaya]] Catholics. In 1923, [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u201339) set up a full-fledged Syro-Malabar hierarchy with [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam-Angamaly]] as the [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|Metropolitan See]] and [[Augustine Kandathil]] as the first [[Major archbishop|Head and Archbishop]] of the Church.

To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896. They were known as Catholic Chaldean Syrians during the period from around 1787(Angamaly Padiyola) to around 1911. They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

A woman dressed as a [[dominatrix]] (wearing black) is sitting in the background.]]\n'''Sexuality in music videos''' has been evident since the 1980s. The extent to which stereotypes align with gender portrayal varies with each decade. Music video content has remained culturally relevant and subliminally influential on adolescent character development. In addition, the overlap between race and gender is evident throughout music video history. By analyzing the correlation between music video material and gender representation, conclusions can be drawn pertaining to how music television impacts young adults' perceptions of appropriate societal behavior.\n\nWomen and men are portrayed differently. From the 1980s, when music videos were first released, men appeared more often than women and were more likely to be the lead character. Over time, the perception of women has changed. In contemporary music videos the implication is female characters are valued for their physical appearance and their ability to entertain and pleasure men. In many music videos, cameras point towards a woman's chest and legs. Women are often dressed in more revealing clothes to attract\u2014especially the male audience.\n\nHuman sexuality not only includes gender but also people's behavior. Within music videos, certain songs impact listeners differently. Scientists have proven female adolescents are more likely to use music to reflect their emotional state. Men are more likely to use music as a source of energy or create a more positive image of themselves. Many artists include references to sex, drugs, violence, etc. in their music and portray these in their music videos. As more adolescents watch these videos, there has been an increase in negative behaviors. The human sexuality in music videos, as well as the behaviors portrayed by the artists, can give both positive and negative impressions to the viewing audience.\n\n== Effects of Sexualization ==\nThere are four different types of sexualization: favoring sexual self-objectification, relating sexual desirability to self-esteem, equating physical attractiveness with being sexy, and lastly contextualizing sexual boundaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref> The first type of sexualization, favoring sexual subjectification, is when a women treats herself as an sexual object, but the treatment is chosen by the woman. The second type of sexualization, equating physical attractiveness with being sexy, is that being physically attractive is the equivalent to looking sexy but they are not physically attractive unless they look sexy. If they're not physically attractive, they need to look sexy to appear physically attractive. The third type of sexualization, relating sexual desirability to self-esteem, is being sexually desirable to be satisfied.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref> For example, \u201cshe may base her self-esteem on other contingencies besides beings sexually desirable, such as others\u2019 approval, but her self-esteem is also dependent on sexual desirability\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref><sup>1365</sup>. And lastly, the fourth type of sexualization, contextualizing sexual boundary, is considered because it violates sexuality social norms. Either one of these types of sexualization will have a positive or a negative effect on the viewer.\u00a0<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref> \u00a0 \n\nYounger adults who had a greater exposure to rap videos are two times more likely to have multiple sexual partners and over 1.5 times more likely to have contributed a disease. Watching violent and sexist music videos affects young people's sexual and violent behaviors and attitudes towards their own gender sex roles as well as in intimate relationships with their partners. The main thing that everyone can obviously see is that in any media where women are sexualized is saying that women are \"sex objects\"\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oyesomi|first=Kehinde|last2=Salawu|first2=Abiodun|date=2018-12-01|title=Influence of Sexualisation of Women in Music Videos on the Body Image of Nigerian Female Youths|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P4-2167240048/influence-of-sexualisation-of-women-in-music-videos|journal=Gender & Behaviour|volume=16|issue=3|pages=12059|issn=1596-9231}}</ref> \n\n==1980s==\nOn August 1, 1981, [[MTV]], the first 24-hour [[music video]] channel, began broadcasting.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal | last1 = Seidman | first1 = S.

Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily affected the ways adolescents viewed their role in society.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nMusic videos released in the 1980s typically depicted women as alluring objects. Aligning with typical stereotypes, women were portrayed as attractive, yet submissive. Although women's talents may be acknowledged, their skill never surpassed the male's; this concept is evident in AC/DC's video for \"[[Sink the Pink]]\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In the video one of the main characters is a self-assured woman who is a skilled pool player. She uses her talent and [[sexuality]] as an attention-getter but is not shown as more talented than the male characters.\n\nIn a 1987 study, thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed. The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified, 17% showed women's talents being accounted for yet her sexual role was highlighted, 14% did not align with typical stereotypes and12% acknowledged women's independence.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In addition to these results, touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and women were often seen in seductive clothing.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==1990s==\nMusic remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s. The music scene transitioned into a darker and more provocative sound with the rise of the genres of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip-hop]] and [[R&B]]. Popular music videos of the time came from artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Weezer]], Michael Jackson, and [[Radiohead]]. While the acclaimed artists and genres of the time differed from the previous decade, the visual depictions of this music and how they were delivered to the public remained the same. MTV continued to be socially relevant. Airing music videos continued youth culture's exposure to varied visual experiences. As music videos grew in popularity and cultural prominence, researchers began to look at the link between gender identities and mass media platforms. Several studies have been conducted regarding gender portrayals in music videos of the 1990s.\n\nIn early 1990, MTV created a program standards department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content. It sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures. For example, MTV rejected [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] \"[[Justify My Love#Music video|Justify my Love]]\" video due to its explicit content. After this program was implemented, a study was conducted to analyze the centrality and depiction of women in the 100 most popular videos of the decade. This study first sorted men and women in the categories of either leading or supporting figures in the videos revealing men outnumbered women in lead roles by a five-to-one margin.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite journal |last=Gow |first=Joe |date=21 May 2009 |title=Reconsidering gender roles on MTV: Depictions in the most popular music videos of the early 1990s |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934219609367647 |journal=Communication Reports |volume=9:2 |pages=151\u2013161 |doi=10.1080/08934219609367647 |access-date=November 14, 2019 |via=Taylor & Francis|doi-broken-date=2020-03-20 }}</ref> Secondly, the study categorized the lead roles into seven main portrayals: artist, poser, comic, actress, superhuman, dancer, or crowd-pleaser. The analysis found that a majority of women in leadership roles were portrayed as either posers (35%) or dancers (29%), while men in lead roles were more equally disbursed among the seven categories.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Portraying women predominately as dancers or posers implied that, in the 90s, women needed not display musical talent, but instead physical talent that emphasized a sexual attitude. Meanwhile, the equal disbursement of men among the categories suggested that men could better exhibit skills of musical and performing prowess.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nOther studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995. 44.7% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role, while 31.7% of the videos portrayed women as conventional, meaning they served either as objects or sensory props to romantic male desire.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alexander |first=Susan |title=The Gender Role Paradox in Youth Culture: An Analysis of Women in Music Videos  |journal=Michigan Sociological Review |volume=Vol. 13 (Fall 1999) |pages=46\u201364 |jstor=40969035 |year=1999 }}</ref> However, the overtly sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed. Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered, proving women could also be depicted as more subliminally sexual than men. For example, in the videos only 1.24% of men touched their hair compared to 38.35% of females.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = Cara | year = 2011 | title = Performing gender: A content analysis of gender display in music videos | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3\u20134 | pages = 160\u2013172 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9814-2 }}</ref> Additionally, only 74% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 26.80% of females. The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s.\n\n==2000s==\n[[File:Womanizer Miami.jpg|thumb|Singer [[Britney Spears]] performs in [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus tour]] in Miami, 2009]]\n\nMusic remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s, even though not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indie-related and electronic genres. Teen Pop had a heavy influence over the 90s and into the first part of the decade. Artists like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[NSYNC]] and [[Backstreet Boys]] were extremely popular in the early 2000s. By the mid-2000s, Contemporary R&B had become the most popular genre with artists Like [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] at the forefront.\n\nA 2008 study by Jacob Turner hypothesized that African American genres of music\u2014hip-hop, rhythm and blues\u2014would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while white genres\u2014Country and Rock\u2014would feature less. The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content. The study also found that 90.09% of mixed Hip-Hop and R&B music videos contained sexual content, followed by Hip-Hop with 79.7% and R&B with 76.9%. The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were Rock with 40% and Country with 37%. The study also looked into how African American and white wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos. It found African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than white wallpaper characters. The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos, it proposes this is because videos featuring African Americans contained significantly more sexual content than videos that featured whites.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Turner |first=Jacob |date=May 22, 2008 |title=Hegemony, Hedonism, and Hip-Hop: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/2/9/1/6/p229166_index.html |journal=Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association |access-date=14 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418232237/http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/2/9/1/6/p229166_index.html |archive-date=18 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nIn 2004, many family groups and politicians lobbied unsuccessfully to ban [[Eric Prydz]]'s \"[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]\" video for containing women dancing in a sexually suggestive way.\n\nIn 2005, the music video of \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]\", which featured [[Jessica Simpson]] in character as [[Daisy Duke]], was controversial for featuring Simpson in \"revealing\" outfits and washing the [[General Lee (car)|General Lee car]] in her bikini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/has-sienna-miller-found-love-bloom-wbna8669398|title=Has Sienna Miller found love in Bloom?|last=Walls|first=Jeannette|date=July 27, 2005|publisher=Today.com|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref> The controversy resulted in the music video being banned in some countries.\n\nSexuality in music videos can be perceived as something positive or negative, depending on the viewer. It has been growing and impacting the world. In 2008, sexual songs were on the top of the [[Billboard charts]]. Some sexual music videos have brought a varying degree of discomfort to people, leading to them being banned. For example, Madonna's music video for \"[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]\" was banned due to sexualizing and portraying girls as violent and non-traditional.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carpentier |first=Francesva |date=December 2014 |title=When Sex Is on the Air: Impression Formation After Exposure to Sexual Music |journal=[[Sexuality & Culture]] |volume=18:4 |issue=4 |pages=818\u2013832 |doi=10.1007/s12119-014-9223-8 }}</ref> \n\n===Role of social media platforms===\nIn the 2000s, social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] grew in popularity, allowing users to share music videos quickly with one another. This had an impact on the direction of sexuality in music videos. Due to the increased accessibility of music videos online, many of which featured some sexually suggestive content, this led to the increased perception of normality with respect to sexual themes in music videos. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn particular, [[YouTube]] was a major contributor to this trend.

Although YouTube's success in the 2000s was relatively limited compared to its explosive growth in the 2010s, it was nevertheless one of the most popular sites on the internet. Naturally, it became a hub for music videos as many content creators and fans flocked to the site to post content. The easy accessibility of various music videos, some charged with sexual themes, began to increase the perception of its normality.\n\n==2010s==\nInto the 2010s, artists continued to garner headlines for provocative content in their music videos. For example, [[Rihanna|Rihanna's]] music video for the song \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\", in which she simulates sex with a life-sized doll and wears [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] gear, generated much media attention and was banned in 11 countries.

Sexual themes were explored in videos that grew to enormous popularity on YouTube. [[Meghan Trainor]]'s 2014 single \"[[All About That Bass]]\" is one example of this trend, although a milder one, as the sexual themes were very subtle. Nevertheless, the video amassed over 2.3 billion views on YouTube as of November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk |title=Meghan Trainor - All About That Bass (Official Music Video) |website=YouTube |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831172355/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk |archive-date=31 August 2015 }}</ref> Also in the 2010s came the rise of music [[Streaming media|streaming]] platforms such as [[Spotify]], which reached 248 million active users by October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1736762/spotify-grows-monthly-active-users-and-turns-profit-shares-jump-15-percent/ |title=Spotify is still the king of music streaming\u2014for now |last=DaSilva |first=Matthew |date=October 28, 2019 |website=qz.com |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105012521/https://qz.com/1736762/spotify-grows-monthly-active-users-and-turns-profit-shares-jump-15-percent/ |archive-date=5 November 2019 }}</ref> The site is possibly creating a [[countermovement]] to the increased acceptance furthered by YouTube's growth by de-emphasizing the video itself in favor of the sound.\n\n==Depictions of race==\nStudies have shown music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Alyssa|date=2012|title=Music Videos and Sexual Risk in African American Adolescent Girls|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|issue=2|pages=93\u2013103|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224}}</ref> For example, African American women are more likely to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing.

Race and music have been intertwined for hundreds of years, with certain races relating to specific types of music more closely. For example, younger African Americans tend to listen to hip hop while older whites listen to county and classical music. While certain races can relate more to certain music genres, modern times have led to an increase in all races listening to all types of music.\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in races listening to all types of music, the content in music videos has not changed much. Hip hop videos still tend to feature predominantly African Americans with their focus upon a generalized harsh lifestyle that only a portion of the African American population truly faces.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Agenda\">{{cite web |title=Media Portrayals and Black Male Outcomes |url=https://www.opportunityagenda.org/explore/resources-publications/media-representations-impact-black-men/media-portrayals |publisher=The Opportunity Agenda |accessdate=2019-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327030017/https://www.opportunityagenda.org/explore/resources-publications/media-representations-impact-black-men/media-portrayals |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, country songs still tend to focus on a white male lead, while their audience has expanded to include many different races over time. Youth culture has driven the population to become more accepting towards all types of music genres and videos. This has allowed for the roles of certain races and genders within videos to change as well.\n\nWhile the article focuses on the influence of sexuality in music videos, it does not explain how race has an effect on how people are portrayed in them. It is a concept that has drastically changed in the last 30 years as the appeal of different types of music has spread to all races. Certain people of specific races, especially African American women, are used for their sexuality in music videos. By not demonstrating how race has influenced sexuality in music videos, the article does not encompass the full meaning of sexuality in music videos, and how and why different sexualization of people occurs.\n\nModern technology, social media, and prominent figures in music are increasing the reach of music globally, including South Korea and India. Their growing influence in the music industry has allowed for many racial stereotypes, such as the Indian taxi driver, however, stereotypes within the US still dominate how people from across the world are portrayed in music videos.

Japan's [[Koda Kumi]] and [[AKB48]] also present sexuality in their music videos. Male [[K-pop]] star [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain's]] music video for his song \"[[Rainism]]\" has been credited with helping to refute [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|stereotypes of Asian men as effeminate and weak]] depicting an Asian man in various sexual situations, primarily with white women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Eun-Young|date=2010|title=Playing the Race and Sexuality Cards in the Transnational Pop Game: Korean Music Videos for the USA Market|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=22|issue=2|pages=219\u2013236|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2010.01237.x}}</ref>\n\nIn the article \"Sex and the Spectacles of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos\", Jacob Turner studies the sexual behavior portrayed in music videos by two races.

A woman dressed as a [[dominatrix]] (wearing black) is sitting in the background.]]\n'''Sexuality in music videos''' has been evident since the 1980s. The extent to which stereotypes align with gender portrayal varies with each decade. Music video content has remained culturally relevant and subliminally influential on adolescent character development. In addition, the overlap between race and gender is evident throughout music video history. By analyzing the correlation between music video material and gender representation, conclusions can be drawn pertaining to how music television impacts young adults' perceptions of appropriate societal behavior.\n\nWomen and men are portrayed differently. From the 1980s, when music videos were first released, men appeared more often than women and were more likely to be the lead character. Over time, the perception of women has changed. In contemporary music videos the implication is female characters are valued for their physical appearance and their ability to entertain and pleasure men. In many music videos, cameras point towards a woman's chest and legs. Women are often dressed in more revealing clothes to attract\u2014especially the male audience.\n\nHuman sexuality not only includes gender but also people's behavior. Within music videos, certain songs impact listeners differently. Scientists have proven female adolescents are more likely to use music to reflect their emotional state. Men are more likely to use music as a source of energy or create a more positive image of themselves. Many artists include references to sex, drugs, violence, etc. in their music and portray these in their music videos. As more adolescents watch these videos, there has been an increase in negative behaviors. The human sexuality in music videos, as well as the behaviors portrayed by the artists, can give both positive and negative impressions to the viewing audience.\n\n== Effects of Sexualization ==\nThere are four different types of sexualization: favoring sexual self-objectification, relating sexual desirability to self-esteem, equating physical attractiveness with being sexy, and lastly contextualizing sexual boundaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref> The first type of sexualization, favoring sexual subjectification, is when a women treats herself as an sexual object, but the treatment is chosen by the woman. The second type of sexualization, equating physical attractiveness with being sexy, is that being physically attractive is the equivalent to looking sexy but they are not physically attractive unless they look sexy. If they\u2019re not physically attractive, they need to look sexy to appear physically attractive. The third type of sexualization, relating sexual desirability to self-esteem, is being sexually desirable to be satisfied.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref> For example, \u201cshe may base her self-esteem on other contingencies besides beings sexually desirable, such as others\u2019 approval, but her self-esteem is also dependent on sexual desirability\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Dooyoung|last2=DeLong|first2=Marilyn|date=2019-12-01|title=Defining Female Self Sexualization for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality & Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1350\u20131371|doi=10.1007/s12119-019-09617-3|issn=1936-4822}}</ref><sup>1365</sup>.

Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily affected the ways adolescents viewed their role in society.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nMusic videos released in the 1980s typically depicted women as alluring objects. Aligning with typical stereotypes, women were portrayed as attractive, yet submissive. Although women's talents may be acknowledged, their skill never surpassed the male's; this concept is evident in AC/DC's video for \"[[Sink the Pink]]\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In the video one of the main characters is a self-assured woman who is a skilled pool player. She uses her talent and [[sexuality]] as an attention-getter but is not shown as more talented than the male characters.\n\nIn a 1987 study, thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed. The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified, 17% showed women's talents being accounted for yet her sexual role was highlighted, 14% did not align with typical stereotypes and12% acknowledged women's independence.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In addition to these results, touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and women were often seen in seductive clothing.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==1990s==\nMusic remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s. The music scene transitioned into a darker and more provocative sound with the rise of the genres of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip-hop]] and [[R&B]]. Popular music videos of the time came from artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Weezer]], Michael Jackson, and [[Radiohead]]. While the acclaimed artists and genres of the time differed from the previous decade, the visual depictions of this music and how they were delivered to the public remained the same. MTV continued to be socially relevant. Airing music videos continued youth culture's exposure to varied visual experiences. As music videos grew in popularity and cultural prominence, researchers began to look at the link between gender identities and mass media platforms. Several studies have been conducted regarding gender portrayals in music videos of the 1990s.\n\nIn early 1990, MTV created a program standards department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content. It sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures. For example, MTV rejected [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] \"[[Justify My Love#Music video|Justify my Love]]\" video due to its explicit content. After this program was implemented, a study was conducted to analyze the centrality and depiction of women in the 100 most popular videos of the decade. This study first sorted men and women in the categories of either leading or supporting figures in the videos revealing men outnumbered women in lead roles by a five-to-one margin.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite journal |last=Gow |first=Joe |date=21 May 2009 |title=Reconsidering gender roles on MTV: Depictions in the most popular music videos of the early 1990s |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934219609367647 |journal=Communication Reports |volume=9:2 |pages=151\u2013161 |doi=10.1080/08934219609367647 |access-date=November 14, 2019 |via=Taylor & Francis|doi-broken-date=2020-03-20 }}</ref> Secondly, the study categorized the lead roles into seven main portrayals: artist, poser, comic, actress, superhuman, dancer, or crowd-pleaser. The analysis found that a majority of women in leadership roles were portrayed as either posers (35%) or dancers (29%), while men in lead roles were more equally disbursed among the seven categories.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Portraying women predominately as dancers or posers implied that, in the 90s, women needed not display musical talent, but instead physical talent that emphasized a sexual attitude. Meanwhile, the equal disbursement of men among the categories suggested that men could better exhibit skills of musical and performing prowess.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nOther studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995. 44.7% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role, while 31.7% of the videos portrayed women as conventional, meaning they served either as objects or sensory props to romantic male desire.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alexander |first=Susan |title=The Gender Role Paradox in Youth Culture: An Analysis of Women in Music Videos  |journal=Michigan Sociological Review |volume=Vol. 13 (Fall 1999) |pages=46\u201364 |jstor=40969035 |year=1999 }}</ref> However, the overtly sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed. Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered, proving women could also be depicted as more subliminally sexual than men. For example, in the videos only 1.24% of men touched their hair compared to 38.35% of females.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = Cara | year = 2011 | title = Performing gender: A content analysis of gender display in music videos | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3\u20134 | pages = 160\u2013172 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9814-2 }}</ref> Additionally, only 74% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 26.80% of females. The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s.\n\n==2000s==\n[[File:Womanizer Miami.jpg|thumb|Singer [[Britney Spears]] performs in [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus tour]] in Miami, 2009]]\n\nMusic remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s, even though not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indie-related and electronic genres. Teen Pop had a heavy influence over the 90s and into the first part of the decade. Artists like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[NSYNC]] and [[Backstreet Boys]] were extremely popular in the early 2000s. By the mid-2000s, Contemporary R&B had become the most popular genre with artists Like [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] at the forefront.\n\nA 2008 study by Jacob Turner hypothesized that African American genres of music\u2014hip-hop, rhythm and blues\u2014would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while white genres\u2014Country and Rock\u2014would feature less. The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content. The study also found that 90.09% of mixed Hip-Hop and R&B music videos contained sexual content, followed by Hip-Hop with 79.7% and R&B with 76.9%. The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were Rock with 40% and Country with 37%. The study also looked into how African American and white wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos. It found African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than white wallpaper characters. The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos, it proposes this is because videos featuring African Americans contained significantly more sexual content than videos that featured whites.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Turner |first=Jacob |date=May 22, 2008 |title=Hegemony, Hedonism, and Hip-Hop: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/2/9/1/6/p229166_index.html |journal=Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association |access-date=14 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418232237/http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/2/9/1/6/p229166_index.html |archive-date=18 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nIn 2004, many family groups and politicians lobbied unsuccessfully to ban [[Eric Prydz]]'s \"[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]\" video for containing women dancing in a sexually suggestive way.\n\nIn 2005, the music video of \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]\", which featured [[Jessica Simpson]] in character as [[Daisy Duke]], was controversial for featuring Simpson in \"revealing\" outfits and washing the [[General Lee (car)|General Lee car]] in her bikini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/has-sienna-miller-found-love-bloom-wbna8669398|title=Has Sienna Miller found love in Bloom?|last=Walls|first=Jeannette|date=July 27, 2005|publisher=Today.com|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref> The controversy resulted in the music video being banned in some countries.\n\nSexuality in music videos can be perceived as something positive or negative, depending on the viewer.

This had an impact on the direction of sexuality in music videos. Due to the increased accessibility of music videos online, many of which featured some sexually suggestive content, this led to the increased perception of normality with respect to sexual themes in music videos. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn particular, [[YouTube]] was a major contributor to this trend.

Although YouTube's success in the 2000s was relatively limited compared to its explosive growth in the 2010s, it was nevertheless one of the most popular sites on the internet. Naturally, it became a hub for music videos as many content creators and fans flocked to the site to post content. The easy accessibility of various music videos, some charged with sexual themes, began to increase the perception of its normality.\n\n==2010s==\nInto the 2010s, artists continued to garner headlines for provocative content in their music videos. For example, [[Rihanna|Rihanna's]] music video for the song \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\", in which she simulates sex with a life-sized doll and wears [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] gear, generated much media attention and was banned in 11 countries.

Sexual themes were explored in videos that grew to enormous popularity on YouTube. [[Meghan Trainor]]'s 2014 single \"[[All About That Bass]]\" is one example of this trend, although a milder one, as the sexual themes were very subtle. Nevertheless, the video amassed over 2.3 billion views on YouTube as of November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk |title=Meghan Trainor - All About That Bass (Official Music Video) |website=YouTube |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831172355/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk |archive-date=31 August 2015 }}</ref> Also in the 2010s came the rise of music [[Streaming media|streaming]] platforms such as [[Spotify]], which reached 248 million active users by October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1736762/spotify-grows-monthly-active-users-and-turns-profit-shares-jump-15-percent/ |title=Spotify is still the king of music streaming\u2014for now |last=DaSilva |first=Matthew |date=October 28, 2019 |website=qz.com |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105012521/https://qz.com/1736762/spotify-grows-monthly-active-users-and-turns-profit-shares-jump-15-percent/ |archive-date=5 November 2019 }}</ref> The site is possibly creating a [[countermovement]] to the increased acceptance furthered by YouTube's growth by de-emphasizing the video itself in favor of the sound.\n\n==Depictions of race==\nStudies have shown music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Alyssa|date=2012|title=Music Videos and Sexual Risk in African American Adolescent Girls|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|issue=2|pages=93\u2013103|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224}}</ref> For example, African American women are more likely to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing.

Race and music have been intertwined for hundreds of years, with certain races relating to specific types of music more closely. For example, younger African Americans tend to listen to hip hop while older whites listen to county and classical music. While certain races can relate more to certain music genres, modern times have led to an increase in all races listening to all types of music.\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in races listening to all types of music, the content in music videos has not changed much. Hip hop videos still tend to feature predominantly African Americans with their focus upon a generalized harsh lifestyle that only a portion of the African American population truly faces.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Agenda\">{{cite web |title=Media Portrayals and Black Male Outcomes |url=https://www.opportunityagenda.org/explore/resources-publications/media-representations-impact-black-men/media-portrayals |publisher=The Opportunity Agenda |accessdate=2019-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327030017/https://www.opportunityagenda.org/explore/resources-publications/media-representations-impact-black-men/media-portrayals |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, country songs still tend to focus on a white male lead, while their audience has expanded to include many different races over time. Youth culture has driven the population to become more accepting towards all types of music genres and videos. This has allowed for the roles of certain races and genders within videos to change as well.\n\nWhile the article focuses on the influence of sexuality in music videos, it does not explain how race has an effect on how people are portrayed in them. It is a concept that has drastically changed in the last 30 years as the appeal of different types of music has spread to all races. Certain people of specific races, especially African American women, are used for their sexuality in music videos. By not demonstrating how race has influenced sexuality in music videos, the article does not encompass the full meaning of sexuality in music videos, and how and why different sexualization of people occurs.\n\nModern technology, social media, and prominent figures in music are increasing the reach of music globally, including South Korea and India. Their growing influence in the music industry has allowed for many racial stereotypes, such as the Indian taxi driver, however, stereotypes within the US still dominate how people from across the world are portrayed in music videos.

Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=16}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1980.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=18}} The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}} At the conclusion of the Tour, [[\u00d3scar Pereiro]] ({{ct|PHO|2005|nolink=yes}}) was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=96}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]].

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=16}} Time bonuses given at the end of each [[mass start]] stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=18}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=9\u201310}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=16}} The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=16}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1980.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=17}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|p=18}} The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2005|pp=5\u20136}} At the conclusion of the Tour, [[\u00d3scar Pereiro]] ({{ct|PHO|2005|nolink=yes}}) was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=96}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]].
