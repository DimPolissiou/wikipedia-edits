From the latter [[Great Church|\"orthodox\" Christianity]] eventually arose, while mainstream Judaism developed into [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries.

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment.

The two most relevant are the Messiah ben Joseph and the traditional Messiah ben David.

John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.}}\n\nA significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups' differing theological interpretations of the Temple's destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: \"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment.

John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.}}\n\nA significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups' differing theological interpretations of the Temple's destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: \"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

This may be accompanied by [[epicanthal fold]]s (extra fold of skin at the inner corner of the eye), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping of the eyelids), [[proptosis]] (bulging eyes), [[strabismus]] (inward or outward turning of the eyes), [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (jerking movement of the eyes) and refractive visual errors.\n\nThe nose may be small, wide, and upturned.\n\nThe development of the ears and auditory system may be affected in people with Noonan's syndrome. This can result in low-set ears (in over 90%), backward-rotated ears (over 90%), thick helix (outer rim) of ear (over 90%), incomplete folding of ears, chronic [[otitis media]] (ear infections), and hearing loss.\n\nDevelopment of the mouth may also be affected in Noonan syndrome. This can result in deeply grooved philtrum (top lip line) (over 90%), [[micrognathia]] (undersized lower jaw), high arched palate, articulation difficulties (teeth don't line up) which can lead to dental problems. Similar to the muscular manifestations above, in the mouth, poor tongue control may be observed.\n\n===Skin===\n\nSkin signs and symptoms in Noonan syndrome include [[lymphedema]] (lymph swelling of the extremities), [[keloid]] formation, excessive scar formation, [[hyperkeratosis]] (overdevelopment of outer skin layer), [[Nevus|pigmented nevi]] (darkly pigmented skin spots), and [[connective tissue disease]]\n\n===Musculoskeletal===\nAbnormalities in the limbs and extremities may occur in Noonan syndrome. This may manifest as bluntly ended fingers, extra padding on fingers and toes, [[edema]] of the back of hands and tops of feet, and [[cubitus valgus]] (wide carrying angle of the elbows).\n\nFor short stature, growth hormone is sometimes combined with IGF-1 (or as an alternative, IGF-1 as a stand-alone) can be used to achieve an increased height/final height quicker. The final adult height of individuals with Noonan syndrome is about 161\u2013167&nbsp;cm in males and 150\u2013155&nbsp;cm in females, which approaches the lower limit of normal.<ref name=\":11\">{{Citation|last=Allanson|first=Judith E.|title=Noonan Syndrome|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1124/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=20301303|access-date=2019-11-18|last2=Roberts|first2=Amy E.|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\nSpinal abnormalities may be present up to 30% of the time and this may require surgery to correct in over 60% of these cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other musculoskeletal manifestations in Noonan syndrome are associated with undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders which can be associated with joint contractures (tightness) or joint hypermobility (looseness).Additional factors may present in the form of winging of the scapula, scoliosis, breast bone prominence (pectus carinatum), breast bone depression (pectus excavatum) .

However, despite identification of 14 causative genes, the absence of a known mutation will not exclude the diagnosis, as  more, as-yet-undiscovered genes can cause NS. Thus, the diagnosis of NS is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a person has enough of the features to warrant the label. The principal values of making a genetic diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation. For example, an increase in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen in people with a mutation of ''KRAS'' and an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia exists for a mutation of ''PTPN11''. In the future, studies may lead to a targeted management of NS symptoms that depends on what genetic mutation a person has.\n\n===Before birth===\n\nPrenatal features that might lead physicians to consider a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome include cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, and edema.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n\nWhile [[Turner syndrome]] has similarities with renal anomalies and developmental delay, Turner syndrome is only found in females and often expresses differently.

This may be accompanied by [[epicanthal fold]]s (extra fold of skin at the inner corner of the eye), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping of the eyelids), [[proptosis]] (bulging eyes), [[strabismus]] (inward or outward turning of the eyes), [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (jerking movement of the eyes) and refractive visual errors.\n\nThe nose may be small, wide, and upturned.\n\nThe development of the ears and auditory system may be affected in people with Noonan's syndrome. This can result in low-set ears (in over 90%), backward-rotated ears (over 90%), thick helix (outer rim) of ear (over 90%), incomplete folding of ears, chronic [[otitis media]] (ear infections), and hearing loss.\n\nDevelopment of the mouth may also be affected in Noonan syndrome. This can result in deeply grooved philtrum (top lip line) (over 90%), [[micrognathia]] (undersized lower jaw), high arched palate, articulation difficulties (teeth don't line up) which can lead to dental problems. Similar to the muscular manifestations above, in the mouth, poor tongue control may be observed.\n\n===Skin===\n\nSkin signs and symptoms in Noonan syndrome include [[lymphedema]] (lymph swelling of the extremities), [[keloid]] formation, excessive scar formation, [[hyperkeratosis]] (overdevelopment of outer skin layer), [[Nevus|pigmented nevi]] (darkly pigmented skin spots), and [[connective tissue disease]]\n\n===Musculoskeletal===\nAbnormalities in the limbs and extremities may occur in Noonan syndrome. This may manifest as bluntly ended fingers, extra padding on fingers and toes, [[edema]] of the back of hands and tops of feet, and [[cubitus valgus]] (wide carrying angle of the elbows).\n\nFor short stature, growth hormone is sometimes combined with IGF-1 (or as an alternative, IGF-1 as a stand-alone) can be used to achieve an increased height/final height quicker. The final adult height of individuals with Noonan syndrome is about 161\u2013167&nbsp;cm in males and 150\u2013155&nbsp;cm in females, which approaches the lower limit of normal.<ref name=\":11\">{{Citation|last=Allanson|first=Judith E.|title=Noonan Syndrome|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1124/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=20301303|access-date=2019-11-18|last2=Roberts|first2=Amy E.|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\nSpinal abnormalities may be present up to 30% of the time and this may require surgery to correct in over 60% of these cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other musculoskeletal manifestations in Noonan syndrome are associated with undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders which can be associated with joint contractures (tightness) or joint hypermobility (looseness).Additional factors may present in the form of winging of the scapula, scoliosis, breast bone prominence (pectus carinatum), breast bone depression (pectus excavatum) . Muscle abnormalities may present as hypotonia (low muscle tone) which may lead to lordosis (increased hollow in the back) due to poor abdominal muscle tone.\n\n===Heart===\n\nNoonan syndrome is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. This includes pulmonary valvular stenosis (50\u201360%), atrial septal defects (10\u201325%), [[Ventricular septal defect|ventricular]] septal defects (5\u201320%) and [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (12\u201335%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Lungs===\n\nRestrictive lung function has been reported in some people.\n\n===Gastrointestinal===\n\nA number of diverse gastrointestinal (SI) symptoms have been associated with Noonan syndrome. These include [[swallowing difficulties]], low gut motility, [[gastroparesis]] (delayed gastric emptying), [[intestinal malrotation]], and frequent or forceful [[vomiting]]. These digestive issues may lead to [[decreased appetite]], [[failure to thrive]] from infancy to puberty (75%), and occasionally the need for a feeding tube.\n\n===Genitourinary system===\n\nIn some males with Noonan syndrome, testicles do not descend ([[Cryptorchidism]]).\n\n===Circulation===\n\nLymphatic anomalies including Posterior cervical [[Cystic hygroma|hygroma]] (webbed neck) and [[Lymphedema]] may present in people with Noonan syndrome.\n\nA number of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan Syndrome, these include platelet dysfunction, [[Blood clotting]] disorders, partial deficiency of [[factor VIII]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XI]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XII]]:C, and an imbalance of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} It has been associated with [[Von Willebrand disease]], [[Thrombocytopenia|Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), prolonged activated [[partial thromboplastin time]], combined [[coagulation defects]].

However, despite identification of 14 causative genes, the absence of a known mutation will not exclude the diagnosis, as  more, as-yet-undiscovered genes can cause NS. Thus, the diagnosis of NS is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a person has enough of the features to warrant the label. The principal values of making a genetic diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation. For example, an increase in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen in people with a mutation of ''KRAS'' and an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia exists for a mutation of ''PTPN11''. In the future, studies may lead to a targeted management of NS symptoms that depends on what genetic mutation a person has.\n\n===Before birth===\n\nPrenatal features that might lead physicians to consider a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome include cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, and edema.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n\nWhile [[Turner syndrome]] has similarities with renal anomalies and developmental delay, Turner syndrome is only found in females and often expresses differently.
