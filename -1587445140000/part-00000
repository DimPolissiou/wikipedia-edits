After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively.

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate of [[The Culinary Institute of America]] and a veteran of a number of professional kitchens in his long career, which included many years spent as executive chef at [[Brasserie Les Halles]] in Manhattan. He first became known for his bestselling book ''[[Kitchen Confidential (book)|Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly]]'' (2000). \n\nHis first food and world-travel television show ''[[A Cook's Tour (TV series)|A Cook's Tour]]'' ran for 35 episodes on the [[Food Network]] in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he began hosting the [[Travel Channel]]'s culinary and cultural adventure programs ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'' (2005\u20132012) and ''[[The Layover (TV series)|The Layover]]'' (2011\u20132013). In 2013, he began a three-season run as a judge on ''[[The Taste]]'', and concurrently switched his travelogue programming to [[CNN]] to host ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]''. Though best known for his culinary writings and television presentations, along with several books on food and cooking and travel adventures, Bourdain also wrote both fiction and historical nonfiction. On June 8, 2018,  Bourdain died by [[suicide]] while on location in France for ''Parts Unknown''.\n\n==Early life==\nAnthony Bourdain was born on June 25, 1956 in [[New York City]], and was the older of two sons of<ref name=\"Current Biography\">{{cite book|last1=Rolls|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Thompson|editor1-first=Clifford|title=Current Biography Yearbook 2006|date=2006|publisher=H.

After a house party one night, Mel drives to Dan's house drunk. Berating her for being reckless, Dan requests that she stay the night. Mel reacts angrily and pushes him into a dresser, causing Dan to sustain a head wound. At the emergency room, Dan lies about how he got the injury, covering for Mel.\n\nDan interns at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-based record label Topo Records. His co-worker Amanda notices his injury; she points out how different the situation would look if it had happened to Mel and not him. Mel starts a job as a teaching assistant to Ms. Anders at an elementary school. One night, her friends ask how she and Dan keep things fresh, and Jessica suggests they should watch pornography. Dan later catches Mel watching a porn film.\n\nThe next day, they go for lunch with Dan's mother Joanne. Before Mel arrives, Joanne tells Dan that she and his dad will pay his rent if he chooses to move to [[New York City]]. A few nights later, Mel and Dan go to a pool party thrown by Mark. After Mel leaves, Dan kisses Amanda on an impulse. He apologizes, and they agree it is best to stay friends.\n\nThe next morning, Dan goes to Mel's house and she notices his odd behavior. He denies there's anything wrong. That night, Mel borrows Dan's phone at a party and sees a text from Amanda talking about their kiss. They break out into a physical fight, and, in an attempt to subdue Mel's lashing out, Dan holds her to the ground. Cops show up, misreading the situation because Mel stays silent when Dan asks her to clear things up, cops detain him. Dan is released the next morning, but refuses to speak to Mel.\n\nJason and Mark offer Dan a job at Topo Records' new office in [[Brooklyn]]. To celebrate, he goes to a bar with Amanda. She apologizes for sending him the text, and Dan informs her that he and Mel are on a break. Meanwhile, Mel attends a party with her friends, where she meets Will. After becoming intoxicated, Jessica and Will take her home. Jessica goes back to the party, but Will stays behind and attempts to rape Mel while she is semiconscious; she pushes him off and he leaves.\n\nMel tells Dan about Will and tearfully asks him to hold her. The two then go to [[Houston]] to help Mel's mother move out of her childhood home. While there, Dan visits his mom, who encourages him to go to New York. Later, Dan tells Mel about his job offer and she accuses him of only thinking of himself. He, in turn, calls her needy and Mel orders him to leave. Mel then worries that she has messed the relationship up for good. Her roommate Becca suggests that she should sleep on it and give Dan time to cool off.\n\nBack at Dan's house, he and Amanda have sex. The next morning, Mel arrives to apologize and catches Amanda leaving. In the ensuing argument, Mel throws a glass across the room and Dan throws a punch at her, but diverts in the end thinking better of it, causing him to slam his hand into the wall. She pushes Dan into the broken shards, injuring his foot and hand. At the hospital, Dan tells Mel he's sorry and that he no longer wants to go to New York and wants to stay with her.  Mel tells Dan that she thinks he should take the job and move to New York.  Dan rejects that suggestion and says he wants to stay.  Mel tells Dan that she loves him but it doesn't feel right.

After a house party one night, Mel drives to Dan's house drunk. Berating her for being reckless, Dan requests that she stay the night. Mel reacts angrily and pushes him into a dresser, causing Dan to sustain a head wound. At the emergency room, Dan lies about how he got the injury, covering for Mel.\n\nDan interns at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-based record label Topo Records. His co-worker Amanda notices his injury; she points out how different the situation would look if it had happened to Mel and not him. Mel starts a job as a teaching assistant to Ms. Anders at an elementary school. One night, her friends ask how she and Dan keep things fresh, and Jessica suggests they should watch pornography. Dan later catches Mel watching a porn film.\n\nThe next day, they go for lunch with Dan's mother Joanne. Before Mel arrives, Joanne tells Dan that she and his dad will pay his rent if he chooses to move to [[New York City]]. A few nights later, Mel and Dan go to a pool party thrown by Mark. After Mel leaves, Dan kisses Amanda on an impulse. He apologizes, and they agree it is best to stay friends.\n\nThe next morning, Dan goes to Mel's house and she notices his odd behavior. He denies there's anything wrong. That night, Mel borrows Dan's phone at a party and sees a text from Amanda talking about their kiss. They break out into a physical fight, and, in an attempt to subdue Mel's lashing out, Dan holds her to the ground. Cops show up, misreading the situation because Mel stays silent when Dan asks her to clear things up, cops detain him. Dan is released the next morning, but refuses to speak to Mel.\n\nJason and Mark offer Dan a job at Topo Records' new office in [[Brooklyn]]. To celebrate, he goes to a bar with Amanda. She apologizes for sending him the text, and Dan informs her that he and Mel are on a break. Meanwhile, Mel attends a party with her friends, where she meets Will. After becoming intoxicated, Jessica and Will take her home. Jessica goes back to the party, but Will stays behind and attempts to rape Mel while she is semiconscious; she pushes him off and he leaves.\n\nMel tells Dan about Will and tearfully asks him to hold her. The two then go to [[Houston]] to help Mel's mother move out of her childhood home. While there, Dan visits his mom, who encourages him to go to New York. Later, Dan tells Mel about his job offer and she accuses him of only thinking of himself. He, in turn, calls her needy and Mel orders him to leave. Mel then worries that she has messed the relationship up for good. Her roommate Becca suggests that she should sleep on it and give Dan time to cool off.\n\nBack at Dan's house, he and Amanda have sex. The next morning, Mel arrives to apologize and catches Amanda leaving. In the ensuing argument, Mel throws a glass across the room and Dan throws a punch at her, but diverts in the end thinking better of it, causing him to slam his hand into the wall. She pushes Dan into the broken shards, injuring his foot and hand. At the hospital, Dan tells Mel he's sorry and that he no longer wants to go to New York and wants to stay with her.  Mel tells Dan that she thinks he should take the job and move to New York.  Dan rejects that suggestion and says he wants to stay.  Mel tells Dan that she loves him but it doesn't feel right.  Dan tells Mel that he doesn't want to break up but she then asks Dan to look her in the eyes and tell her that he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Dan is unable to and instead says he's sorry.  Mel says okay and with that, reality starts to set in that their 6 year relationship is finished.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taissa Farmiga]] as Melanie \"Mel\" Clark\n* [[Ben Rosenfield]] as Daniel \"Dan\" Mercer\n* [[Lindsay Burdge]] as Amanda\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Mark\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Joanne Mercer\n* [[Peter Vack]] as Will\n* [[Jennifer Lafleur]] as Ms. Anders\n* [[Molly McMichael]] as Jessica\n* Alysia Lucas as Becca\n* Jason Newman as Jason\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn June 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Hannah Fidell]] had written and directed a relationship drama film, set for release in 2015.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taissa-farmiga-ben-rosenfield-starring-711577|title=Taissa Farmiga, Ben Rosenfield Starring in Hannah Fidell's New Feature|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> The feature was produced by Kelly Williams, Andrew Logan and Jonathan Duffy, and executive produced by [[Mark Duplass|Mark]] and [[Jay Duplass]] through their production company [[Duplass Brothers Productions]].<ref name=\"The Wrap\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/boardwalk-empires-ben-rosenfield-american-horror-storys-taissa-farmiga-finish-new-film/|title=Boardwalk Empire's Ben Rosenfield, American Horror Story's Taissa Farmiga Finish New Film|website=[[TheWrap]]|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|date=June 14, 2014}}</ref> Fidell had been approached by Mark Duplass to make a film depicting a young couple experiencing [[domestic violence]], which appealed to her.<ref name=\"End of the Affair\"/> On June 12, 2014, after filming for the project was already complete, it was revealed that [[Taissa Farmiga]] and [[Ben Rosenfield]] play the leading roles, Melanie Clark and Dan Mercer, respectively.<ref name=\"Casting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ioncinema.com/news/casting-news/taissa-farmiga-ben-rosenfield-find-common-ground-in-hannah-fidells-latest|title=Taissa Farmiga & Ben Rosenfield Find Common Ground in Hannah Fidell's Latest|website=Ion Cinema|first=Eric|last=Lavallee|date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> That same day, it was also reported that [[Peter Vack]], [[Joshua Leonard]], [[Jennifer Lafleur]], and [[Lindsay Burdge]] have supporting roles in the film.<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/06/hannah-fidell-taissa-farmiga-ben-rosenfield-mark-duplass/|title='A Teacher's Hannah Fidell Taps Taissa Farmiga, Ben Rosenfield, Mark Duplass For Sophomore Feature|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Jen|last=Yamato|date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Before filming began, Fidell and the two main actors (Farmiga and Rosenfield) went to [[the Berkshires]] in [[Massachusetts]] to study the script outline and develop their characters.<ref name=\"Doty\">{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/taissa-farmiga-talks-6-years-and-sis-plus-125438945167.html|title=Taissa Farmiga Talks '6 Years' and Sis, Plus Exclusive Trailer|website=[[Yahoo!

Wrapping the tape in reverse and then resealing it, he was able to make casts of objects including himself. One of his first street projects was a series of clear tape self casts that he installed on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Jenkins became immediately interested in the reactions of the people and considered his installation as much a social experiment as an art project.<ref>[http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/let-no-man-scare-you Let No Man Scare You<!-- Bot generated title -->] ''The Morning News'', March 30, 2006</ref>''\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: left; margin-right: 1.4em;\">\n[[Image:Tape giraffe.jpg|thumb|none|185px|''Tape Giraffe'']]\n</div>\n\nIn 2004 he moved back to Washington DC and in 2005 he began working with Sandra Fernandez on the ''Storker Project'', a series in which clear casts of toy babies are installed in different cities to interact with their surrounding environment.<ref>[http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/let-no-man-scare-you Let No Man Scare You<!-- Bot generated title -->] ''The Morning News'', March 30, 2006</ref>  Jenkins and Fernandez continued to create other installations using tape animals--dogs playing in litter, giraffes nibbling plastic bags from trees, and ducks swimming in gutters.

The tape casts were filled with newspaper and cement and dressed to create hyper realistic sculptural duplicates of himself and Fernandez.
