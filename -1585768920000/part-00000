Rails reached Hillsdale from the east in 1843. The state of Michigan sold the line in 1846 and it became the Michigan Southern Rail Road. Construction of the line continued west of Hillsdale and by 1852 it became part of a line to Chicago through Coldwater and Sturgis, Michigan. This line would eventually become unofficially known as \"The Old Road\" and in 1869 came under the [[Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway]] (LS&MS) when the Michigan Southern Rail Road and the Lake Shore Railway merged that year.<ref name=\"AmShort\"/><ref name=\"HillsdaleHistory\">[https://www.hillsdalehistoricalsociety.org/rr-to-hillsdale/ Hillsdale Historical Society Railroad to Hillsdale]</ref>\n\nIN's connection from Hillsdale to the unincorporated area of Bankers was originally built as the Detroit, Hillsdale and Indiana Rail Road in 1871. A line that ran from Bankers to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. The line was also acquired by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern in 1881.

It was acquired soon after the company began operation by LS&MS in 1897. The tracks immediately north of Litchfield were abandoned.<ref name=\"LSMShistory\"/>\n\nBy 1914 the LS&MS was formally merged with the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad and a number of other leased railroads including the nearby [[Michigan Central Railroad]] to create the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYC).

The line originally known as its \"Chicago Extension\" ran from a junction with Wabash's Detroit to Fort Wayne line in Montpelier directly west to [[Gary, Indiana]] terminating at a junction known as Clark Junction. At the junction Wabash trains would then run over the [[Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal]] and [[Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad|Chicago and Western Indiana]] switching and terminal railroads to connect with the Chicago area rail network and Wabash's own Chicago rail yards. The line would eventually be designated as Wabash's 4th District and became part of the shortest route for trains between Detroit and Chicago. A connection from Montpelier to [[Toledo, Ohio]] would also be added after 1900. \nThe 4th District would become the first Wabash district to be dieselized (operating with diesel locomotives instead of [[steam locomotive|steam]]) in 1950 and the last rail line in Indiana to operate [[mixed train]]s in 1962. Wabash would continue to operate the line until the railroad was acquired by the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&W), through lease in 1964 and full ownership in 1970. N&W would designate the line as its Gary District and continue to operate it until the 1980s.<ref name=\"wabash4\">Baird, Victor A.

Which would mean all the former LS&MS NYC lines would be owned and operated by Penn Central.\n\nPenn Central's bankruptcy in 1970 and the dire financial condition of other [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] railroads prompted the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to enact legislation creating [[Conrail]] in 1976. Conrail would take over the rail operations of the financially struggling carriers and merge them into a new rail system. However, the Penn Central routes in Hillsdale County, west to Quincy in Branch County and south to Stubenville, Indiana would not be included in the new Conrail system.<ref name=\"MDOThistory\">[https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,4616,7-151-9623_11154---,00.html MDOT Michigan's Railroad History]</ref>\n\nThe State of Michigan, faced with the abandonment of 200 miles of track when Penn Central would cease rail operations, would step in and create a subsidy program to continue rail service on Michigan trackage that would not be acquired by Conrail. With the assistance of the subsidies the Hillsdale County Railway Company (HCRC) was incorporated on January 27, 1976 and began operations on April 1, 1976 on the former Penn Central routes in Hillsdale County, west to Quincy and south to Stubenville. The company started with routes approximately 60 miles in length and it acquired a handful of first-generation [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] diesel locomotives. The new railway could interchange traffic with Conrail at Quincy and with the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] at Stubenville.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Mario Milletti.\u00a0 Penn Central on New Tracks Without a Railroad.

This would further authorize the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation (now [[Michigan Department of Transportation|MDOT]]) to purchase Michigan rail lines in jeopardy of abandonment and contract with a rail carrier to be the designated operator of the lines the state acquired. The state would purchase from the Penn Central Company the tracks that the Hillsdale County Railway was operating on within Michigan and HCRC would be the designated operator.<ref name=\"MDOThistory\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1980s Conrail would be seeking abandonment of its less profitable lines including the former LS&MS \"Old Road\" line from Quincy to [[White Pigeon, Michigan]]. While at the same time N&W was in the process of abandoning its Gary District between Montpelier, Ohio and Gary, Indiana. Threatened with potentially losing its rail interchanges, HCRC extended operations on a three-mile section of underused track between Pleasant Lake and Stubenville, Indiana. In April 1986 HCRC purchased an almost 25-mile segment from N&W between Ashley, Indiana through Stubenville to a rail connection with N&W's Detroit - Fort Wayne line near Montpelier, Ohio.<ref name=\"IndyHCRC\">Meints, Graydon M.

The legislation made it easier for railroads to set rates, negotiate shipping contracts, seek abandonment of unprofitable routes and get merger approval. Within two years in 1982 the Norfolk and Western Railway and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] created the Norfolk Southern Corporation which both railways would be completely merged under by 1990. N&W would also began to rationalize its routes and in 1983 began abandonment of segments of its Gary District in favor of its route from Detroit to Chicago through Fort Wayne.<ref name=\"wabash4\"/>\n\nThe owners of the South Milford Grain Company, a [[grain elevator]] business, in South Milford on N&W's Gary District feared that losing rail service would be financially detrimental to their business. In order to preserve their rail connection the grain company would acquire an over 15 mile section of the N&W from [[Wolcottville, Indiana]] through South Milford to Ashley and create the Pigeon River Railroad (PGRV). The new shortline railroad began operating in November 1985 with a former [[Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad|Detroit and Toledo Shore Line]] [[EMD GP7|GP7]] locomotive. Eastbound PGRV trains from South Milford would transfer onto the Hillsdale County Railway at Ashley to interchange with Norfolk Southern in Montpelier. By 1991 PGVR would abandon most of its 5-mile section between South Milford and Wolcottville.<ref name=\"JOC\">[https://www.joc.com/midwest-track-repairs-put-grain-back-train_19940907.html Journal of Commerce,  Midwest Track Repairs put Grain Back on Train, Gregory S.

Its trackage was suffering from deferred maintenance and derailments were becoming a common occurrence. Then in 1992, a 50-car eastbound unit train from South Milford hauled by HCRC derailed near [[Hamilton, Indiana]] costing the South Milford Grain Company $30,000. The grain elevator company's owners decided to assume HCRC's $1 million in debt and it acquired the railway. The grain company then created the Indiana Northeastern Railroad Company to take over the rail operations of the HCRC and its Pigeon River Railroad on December 22, 1992. The IN immediately began to repair and rebuild trackage, spending $3 million on track improvements within its first two years of operation. In 1994 the railroad would gain back on-line customers that had turned to trucking and by 1996 the railroad was hauling 3,400 carloads a year of grain, flour, sugar, food products, fertilizer, plastic and other commodities. Since it began the IN has continued to spend millions of dollars to upgrade its tracks with roadbed, rail, bridge and grade crossing improvements which enables the railroad to haul heavier trains at higher speeds.<ref name=\"AmShort\"/><ref name=\"JOC\"/><ref name=\"locoshop\"/><ref name=\"ecodigest1\">[https://indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=66&ArticleID=64272 Indiana Northeastern Railroad seeking $1.25 million Steuben County loan Indiana Economic Digest, March 6, 2012]</ref>\n\nThe RUA would sell its more than 19 mile long Coldwater to Sturgis segment to Indiana Northeastern in 2004. But, in 2012 IN would apply to abandon this segment due to an absence of traffic.

This eliminated the necessity of the Montpelier, OH to Chicago, IL portion of the line.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Hillsdale County Railway===\n\nOn February 1, 1968 the New York Central Railroad and [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] formally merged creating the [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] railroad. Which would mean all the former LS&MS NYC lines would be owned and operated by Penn Central.\n\nPenn Central's bankruptcy in 1970 and the dire financial condition of other [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] railroads prompted the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to enact legislation creating [[Conrail]] in 1976. Conrail would take over the rail operations of the financially struggling carriers and merge them into a new rail system. However, the Penn Central routes in Hillsdale County, west to Quincy in Branch County and south to Stubenville, Indiana would not be included in the new Conrail system.<ref name=\"MDOThistory\">[https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,4616,7-151-9623_11154---,00.html MDOT Michigan's Railroad History]</ref>\n\nThe State of Michigan, faced with the abandonment of 200 miles of track when Penn Central would cease rail operations, would step in and create a subsidy program to continue rail service on Michigan trackage that would not be acquired by Conrail. With the assistance of the subsidies the Hillsdale County Railway Company (HCRC) was incorporated on January 27, 1976 and began operations on April 1, 1976 on the former Penn Central routes in Hillsdale County, west to Quincy and south to Stubenville. The company started with routes approximately 60 miles in length and it acquired a handful of first-generation [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] diesel locomotives. The new railway could interchange traffic with Conrail at Quincy and with the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] at Stubenville.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Mario Milletti.\u00a0 Penn Central on New Tracks Without a Railroad.

The railway would also join the ranks of other US railroads in 1976 who painted at least one locomotive in a special scheme to commemorate the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Its [[EMD NW2|NW2]] switching locomotive was numbered 1976 and painted red and blue divided by a white stripe. It was also named Chief Baw Beese in honor of the early nineteenth-century chief of a [[Nottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi|Huron Band of Potawotami]] Native Americans that lived in what became Hillsdale County.<ref name=\"BawBeese\">[https://www.hillsdalehistoricalsociety.org/baw-beese-lake Hillsdale Historical Society Baw Beese Lake]</ref><ref name=\"RRmich\">[http://www.railroadmichigan.com/hillsdalecounty.html Railroad Michigan.com Hillsdale County Railway]</ref>\n\nIn November 1976 the State of Michigan expanded its support of rail service by enacting the State Transportation Preservation Act of 1976 (Act 295 of 1976). This would further authorize the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation (now [[Michigan Department of Transportation|MDOT]]) to purchase Michigan rail lines in jeopardy of abandonment and contract with a rail carrier to be the designated operator of the lines the state acquired. The state would purchase from the Penn Central Company the tracks that the Hillsdale County Railway was operating on within Michigan and HCRC would be the designated operator.<ref name=\"MDOThistory\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1980s Conrail would be seeking abandonment of its less profitable lines including the former LS&MS \"Old Road\" line from Quincy to [[White Pigeon, Michigan]]. While at the same time N&W was in the process of abandoning its Gary District between Montpelier, Ohio and Gary, Indiana. Threatened with potentially losing its rail interchanges, HCRC extended operations on a three-mile section of underused track between Pleasant Lake and Stubenville, Indiana. In April 1986 HCRC purchased an almost 25-mile segment from N&W between Ashley, Indiana through Stubenville to a rail connection with N&W's Detroit - Fort Wayne line near Montpelier, Ohio.<ref name=\"IndyHCRC\">Meints, Graydon M. Indiana Railroad Lines. 2011. Indiana University Press. page 186 (Hillsdale County Railway)</ref><ref name=\"AmShort\"/>\n\nThe non-profit Branch and St Joseph County County Rail Users Association (RUA) was formed by the city of Coldwater and local business interests to purchase a 30-mile segment between\u00a0 Quincy and Sturgis from Conrail in 1989. RUA contracted with HCRC to operate and maintain over ten miles of the line between Quincy and Coldwater. While a new separate short line railroad, the [[Michigan Southern Railroad (1989)|Michigan Southern Railroad]], would be contracted operate from Coldwater to Sturgis.<ref name=\"dailynews\">Hillsdale Daily News. July 31, 1989. Pg 2</ref>\n\n===Pigeon River Railroad===\n\n\u00a0In 1980 the [[Staggers Rail Act]] was enacted by the federal government which deregulated the United States railroad industry. The legislation made it easier for railroads to set rates, negotiate shipping contracts, seek abandonment of unprofitable routes and get merger approval. Within two years in 1982 the Norfolk and Western Railway and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] created the Norfolk Southern Corporation which both railways would be completely merged under by 1990. N&W would also began to rationalize its routes and in 1983 began abandonment of segments of its Gary District in favor of its route from Detroit to Chicago through Fort Wayne.<ref name=\"wabash4\"/>\n\nThe owners of the South Milford Grain Company, a [[grain elevator]] business, in South Milford on N&W's Gary District feared that losing rail service would be financially detrimental to their business. In order to preserve their rail connection the grain company would acquire an over 15 mile section of the N&W from [[Wolcottville, Indiana]] through South Milford to Ashley and create the Pigeon River Railroad (PGRV). The new shortline railroad began operating in November 1985 with a former [[Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad|Detroit and Toledo Shore Line]] [[EMD GP7|GP7]] locomotive. Eastbound PGRV trains from South Milford would transfer onto the Hillsdale County Railway at Ashley to interchange with Norfolk Southern in Montpelier. By 1991 PGVR would abandon most of its 5-mile section between South Milford and Wolcottville.<ref name=\"JOC\">[https://www.joc.com/midwest-track-repairs-put-grain-back-train_19940907.html Journal of Commerce,  Midwest Track Repairs put Grain Back on Train, Gregory S.

Its trackage was suffering from deferred maintenance and derailments were becoming a common occurrence. Then in 1992, a 50-car eastbound unit train from South Milford hauled by HCRC derailed near [[Hamilton, Indiana]] costing the South Milford Grain Company $30,000. The grain elevator company's owners decided to assume HCRC's $1 million in debt and it acquired the railway. The grain company then created the Indiana Northeastern Railroad Company to take over the rail operations of the HCRC and its Pigeon River Railroad on December 22, 1992. The IN immediately began to repair and rebuild trackage, spending $3 million on track improvements within its first two years of operation. In 1994 the railroad would gain back on-line customers that had turned to trucking and by 1996 the railroad was hauling 3,400 carloads a year of grain, flour, sugar, food products, fertilizer, plastic and other commodities. Since it began the IN has continued to spend millions of dollars to upgrade its tracks with roadbed, rail, bridge and grade crossing improvements which enables the railroad to haul heavier trains at higher speeds.<ref name=\"AmShort\"/><ref name=\"JOC\"/><ref name=\"locoshop\"/><ref name=\"ecodigest1\">[https://indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=66&ArticleID=64272 Indiana Northeastern Railroad seeking $1.25 million Steuben County loan Indiana Economic Digest, March 6, 2012]</ref>\n\nThe RUA would sell its more than 19 mile long Coldwater to Sturgis segment to Indiana Northeastern in 2004. But, in 2012 IN would apply to abandon this segment due to an absence of traffic. Upon abandonment it was anticipated that the route would become a [[rail trail]] however, local opposition led to the abandoned segment being deeded to the adjoining property owners.<ref name=\"STBfile\"/><ref name=\"quincytrail\">[https://www.thedailyreporter.com/news/20170208/trail-proposed-between-coldwater-quincy Trail proposed between Coldwater, Quincy.

In 2012 the railroad opened a new $1.6 million locomotive maintenance facility in [[Hudson, Indiana]]. The facility includes three tracks, two that extend inside the facility, a lighted service pit, a 25-ton crane and other equipment to service locomotives and railcars.<ref name=\"locoshop\"/>\n\nIndiana Northeastern celebrated its 25th year in operation in 2017. Through numerous track rehabilitation projects over its nearly 130 miles of routes and careful management of its resources, the railroad has been a solid, stable and dependable operation capable of handling a diverse flow of traffic in a timely, professional manner.<ref name=\"kiwanis\"/>\n\n==Motive Power==\nIndiana Northeastern's locomotive fleet consists of first and second generation road-switcher [[Diesel locomotive|diesels]] all built by [[Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD). All locomotives have had previous owners and most were originally built for large [[Railroad classes|Class 1]] railroads. Some came from the acquisition of the Hillsdale County Railway and others were acquired through rail service and leasing companies like the [[Indiana Boxcar Corporation]] (IBCX).The railroad purchased its first two six-axle locomotives from Motive Power Resources in 2017. \nIN planned to pair one six-axle locomotive with a four-axle unit to move the grain trains. Indiana Northeastern general manager, Troy Strane told [[Trains Magazine]] he believed one of the new six-axel locomotives could do the work equal to two or three of the railroad's four-axle locomotives.<ref name=\"sd40s\">[https://www.hillsdale.net/news/20170210/indiana-northeastern-railroad-purchases-new-engines IN Purchases New Engines]</ref>\n\n[[File:Indiana Northeastern at Edon Co-Op.

Which was also the original paint scheme on IN's predecessor Pigeon River Railroad's only locomotive, former DTSL GP7 number 47.\nThe locomotives are painted completely black with three yellow pointed-up chevron stripes on both ends of the locomotive and a yellow stripe along the long side of the frame on each side. (Some locomotives only have two chevron stripes on their front nose.) The Indiana Northeastern name is painted white in billboard style in the center on each side of the long hood section. The lettering closely resembles a heavy bold [[Times New Roman]] style [[Serif|Serif font]]. The road numbers are also painted white in the same font and placed under the windows on both sides of the cab.\n\nIN has also been running a former [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] [[EMD GP40]] rebuilt into a GP40-3 with its fleet. The locomotive, numbered DOTX 2000, is owned by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] and has been used as an equipment testbed.\nIn 2017 it was painted into IN's paint scheme with \"United States Department of Transportation\"\u00a0 stenciled on sides of the long hood instead of the Indiana Northeastern name.<ref name=\"locopics\">[https://hiveminer.com/Tags/indiananortheastern IN Photos]</ref>\n\n===Locomotive Roster===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Road Number\n!Model\n!Year Built\n!Notes\n|-\n|1073\n|[[EMD GP10|GP10]]\n|1956\n|Originally [[Illinois Central Railroad]] [[EMD GP9|GP9]] 9167.

{"title_page": "Socioeconomics", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Social economy}}\n{{short description|Social science that studies how economic activity affects and is shaped by social processes}}\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n'''Socioeconomics''' (also known as '''social economics''') is the [[social science]] that studies how [[economic activity]] affects and is shaped by social processes. In general it analyzes how modern [[society|societies]] [[social progress|progress]], [[economic stagnation|stagnate]], or [[social regress|regress]] because of their [[local economy|local]] or regional economy, or the [[global economy]]. Societies are divided into 3 groups: social, cultural and economic. It also refers to the ways that social and economic factors influence the environment.\n\n==Overview==\n\u201cSocioeconomics\u201d is sometimes used as an [[umbrella term]] for various areas of inquiry. The term \u201csocial economics\u201d may refer broadly to the \"use of [[economics]] in the study of [[Social relation|society]]\".<ref name=\"google\"/> More narrowly, contemporary practice considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social \"markets\" (not excluding, for example, [[Assortative mating|sorting]] by marriage) and the formation of [[social norms]].<ref name=\"uoregon\"/> In the relation of economics to [[Value (ethics)|social value]]s.<ref name=\"elsevier\"/>\n\nA distinct supplemental usage describes social economics as \"a discipline studying the reciprocal relationship between economic science on the one hand and [[social philosophy]], [[ethics]], and [[human dignity]] on the other\" toward social reconstruction and improvement<ref name=\"google1\"/> or as also emphasizing [[multidisciplinary]] [[Scientific method|methods]] from such fields as [[sociology]], [[history]], and [[political science]].<ref name=\"e-elgar\"/> In criticizing [[mainstream economics]] for its alleged faulty philosophical premises (for example the pursuit of self-interest) and neglect of dysfunctional economic relationships, such advocates tend to classify social economics as [[heterodox economics|heterodox]].<ref name=\"google2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Socioeconomic Environmental Factors ==\nSocioeconomic systems at the regional level refers to the way social and economic factors influence one another in local communities and households. These systems have a significant impact on the environment through deforestation, pollution, natural disasters, and energy production and use. Through telecoupled systems, these interactions can lead to global impact. Local economies, food insecurity, and environmental hazards are all negative effects that are a direct outcome of socioeconomic systems.\n\n* In Pakistan, deforestation is a major cause of environmental change. Deforestation can be attributed to population growth, change in household dynamics, and resource management. Forests are traditionally owned by the state and control resource management which means their government is responsible for development of forested land. In between 1970 and 2011, the tree coverage decreased by 20.6%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|last2=Haq|first2=Fazlul|last3=Tabassum|first3=Iffat|last4=Ullah|first4=Ihsan|date=February 2014|title=Socio-economic drivers of deforestation in Roghani Valley, Hindu-Raj Mountains, Northern Pakistan|journal=Journal of Mountain Science|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=167\u2013179|doi=10.1007/s11629-013-2770-x|issn=1672-6316}}</ref> The decrease can be attributed to community development and increased use of resources. The issue of deforestation in Pakistan is contributing to climate change because the wood is frequently burned and used as timber fuel which emits CO2 into the atmosphere. Deforestation is also happening due to population growth and the expansion of farmland which creates feedback loops. When forests are cut down to begin agriculture practices, soil degradation often takes place and leads to further issues like crop yields, which can contribute to food insecurity and a decrease in the economy.\n* Due to [[deforestation]], animals often lose their habitats and vegetation is significantly decreased. Habitat loss is common when deforestation happens because not only are the trees being cut down, but the land trees previously inhibited suffer extreme soil erosion due to lack of protection from the tree coverage. Animals' struggle to survive is further hindered due to high temperatures in places where tree coverage is lost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pachamama.org/effects-of-deforestation|title=Effects of Deforestation {{!}} The Pachamama Alliance|website=www.pachamama.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Local community [[Economy|economies]] are affected by this because they depend on these resources to drive their local markets and feed their families. Modern medicine is another thing affected by deforestation because several medicines are derived from plants found in these areas. Loss of these resources means a loss of profit to local communities who depend on these natural entities for profit. This can have a global effect by creating shortages in medicine worldwide.\n* Ocean pollution has massley affected small fishing communities around the world. When the ocean water gets polluted, it has a range of effects on the ocean life. Fish absorb mercury from coal mining and fossil fuel burning which makes them toxic to eat. Food insecurity is a socioeconomic impact of toxic marine life because small coastal communities depend on fishing to drive their local markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmutter|first=Katherine|last2=Nash|first2=Merinda|last3=Dovey|first3=Liz|date=2016-05-13|title=Ocean acidification: assessing the vulnerability of socioeconomic systems in Small Island Developing States|journal=Regional Environmental Change|volume=17|issue=4|pages=973\u2013987|doi=10.1007/s10113-016-0949-8|issn=1436-3798}}</ref> This is one example of a telecoupled system and how global systems\u2019 have an indirect correlation with small communities. Big companies produce this pollution as a spillover system, which affects the fish, which then affects the surrounding communities.\n* Natural disasters are becoming more severe as the environment is shifting. In the Western hemisphere, landslides are becoming more prevalent and severe. As communities continue to expand and develop, landscapes are disrupted by human interactions and unstable hillside areas begin to crumple under these pressures.<ref>{{Cite book|date=2001|title=Open-File Report|chapter=Socioeconomic and environmental impacts of landslides in the Western Hemisphere|language=en|doi=10.3133/ofr01276|last1=Schuster|first1=Robert L.|last2=Highland|first2=Lynn M.}}</ref> These effects can be responsible for habitat loss for animals, home loss for humans, and complete destruction of industrial establishments. This can affect local economies just as any other natural disasters because it disrupts the entire flow of communities. They can be divided into private and public, for example a highway being demolished by a landslide would be considered a public cost. A local farm that lost all of its crops due to a landslide would be considered a private cost. Urbanization and deforestation are primarily responsible for the increasing number of landslides in small communities.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kjekstad|first=Oddvar|title=Economic and Social Impacts of Landslides|date=2009|work=Landslides \u2013 Disaster Risk Reduction|pages=573\u2013587|editor-last=Sassa|editor-first=Kyoji|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69970-5_30|isbn=978-3-540-69966-8|last2=Highland|first2=Lynn|editor2-last=Canuti|editor2-first=Paolo}}</ref>\n* Another socioeconomic factor is the change in the household family. The [[nuclear family]] is traditionally two parents and their children living under the same roof. In the past, households frequently inhibited extended family members such as grandparents. With the shift in the amount of people under one roof, there has been an increase in direct energy consumption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Malcolm|date=November 2012|title=Urban Consumption,edited by Peter W. Newton|journal=Urban Research & Practice|volume=5|issue=3|pages=369\u2013371|doi=10.1080/17535069.2012.727571|issn=1753-5069}}</ref> Less people per household means more households. People are shifting towards single person households as our societal norms evolve. More households mean more energy being used to do things like heat the house, power more T.V. 's, and use more lights. It also means more geographical land space being taken up by people which can lead to further urbanization of rural communities. This has been a shift in communities across the globe.\n* Deforestation, natural disasters, pollution and energy consumption explicitly exhibit how human and natural systems are integrated systems. They are influenced by government policies and contextual factors which often have a more negative impact on the environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=J.|last2=Dietz|first2=T.|last3=Carpenter|first3=S.

These systems have a significant impact on the environment through deforestation, pollution, natural disasters, and energy production and use. Through telecoupled systems, these interactions can lead to global impact. Local economies, food insecurity, and environmental hazards are all negative effects that are a direct outcome of socioeconomic systems.\n\n* In Pakistan, deforestation is a major cause of environmental change. Deforestation can be attributed to population growth, change in household dynamics, and resource management. Forests are traditionally owned by the state and control resource management which means their government is responsible for development of forested land. In between 1970 and 2011, the tree coverage decreased by 20.6%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|last2=Haq|first2=Fazlul|last3=Tabassum|first3=Iffat|last4=Ullah|first4=Ihsan|date=February 2014|title=Socio-economic drivers of deforestation in Roghani Valley, Hindu-Raj Mountains, Northern Pakistan|journal=Journal of Mountain Science|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=167\u2013179|doi=10.1007/s11629-013-2770-x|issn=1672-6316}}</ref> The decrease can be attributed to community development and increased use of resources. The issue of deforestation in Pakistan is contributing to climate change because the wood is frequently burned and used as timber fuel which emits CO2 into the atmosphere. Deforestation is also happening due to population growth and the expansion of farmland which creates feedback loops. When forests are cut down to begin agriculture practices, soil degradation often takes place and leads to further issues like crop yields, which can contribute to food insecurity and a decrease in the economy.\n* Due to [[deforestation]], animals often lose their habitats and vegetation is significantly decreased. Habitat loss is common when deforestation happens because not only are the trees being cut down, but the land trees previously inhibited suffer extreme soil erosion due to lack of protection from the tree coverage. Animals' struggle to survive is further hindered due to high temperatures in places where tree coverage is lost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pachamama.org/effects-of-deforestation|title=Effects of Deforestation {{!}} The Pachamama Alliance|website=www.pachamama.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Local community [[Economy|economies]] are affected by this because they depend on these resources to drive their local markets and feed their families. Modern medicine is another thing affected by deforestation because several medicines are derived from plants found in these areas. Loss of these resources means a loss of profit to local communities who depend on these natural entities for profit. This can have a global effect by creating shortages in medicine world wide.\n* Ocean pollution has massley affected small fishing communities around the world. When the ocean water gets polluted, it has a range of effects on the ocean life. Fish absorb mercury from coal mining and fossil fuel burning which makes them toxic to eat. Food insecurity is a socioeconomic impact of toxic marine life because small coastal communities depend on fishing to drive their local markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmutter|first=Katherine|last2=Nash|first2=Merinda|last3=Dovey|first3=Liz|date=2016-05-13|title=Ocean acidification: assessing the vulnerability of socioeconomic systems in Small Island Developing States|journal=Regional Environmental Change|volume=17|issue=4|pages=973\u2013987|doi=10.1007/s10113-016-0949-8|issn=1436-3798}}</ref> This is one example of a telecoupled system and how global systems\u2019 have an indirect correlation with small communities. Big companies produce this pollution as a spillover system, which affects the fish, which then affects the surrounding communities.\n* Natural disasters are becoming more severe as the environment is shifting. In the Western hemisphere, landslides are becoming more prevalent and severe. As communities continue to expand and develop, landscapes are disrupted by human interactions and unstable hillside areas begin to crumple under these pressures.<ref>{{Cite book|date=2001|title=Open-File Report|chapter=Socioeconomic and environmental impacts of landslides in the Western Hemisphere|language=en|doi=10.3133/ofr01276|last1=Schuster|first1=Robert L.|last2=Highland|first2=Lynn M.}}</ref> These effects can be responsible for habitat loss for animals, home loss for humans, and complete destruction of industrial establishments. This can affect local economies just as any other natural disasters because it disrupts the entire flow of communities. They can be divided into private and public, for example a highway being demolished by a landslide would be considered a public cost. A local farm that lost all of its crops due to a landslide would be considered a private cost. Urbanization and deforestation are primarily responsible for the increasing number of landslides in small communities.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kjekstad|first=Oddvar|title=Economic and Social Impacts of Landslides|date=2009|work=Landslides \u2013 Disaster Risk Reduction|pages=573\u2013587|editor-last=Sassa|editor-first=Kyoji|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69970-5_30|isbn=978-3-540-69966-8|last2=Highland|first2=Lynn|editor2-last=Canuti|editor2-first=Paolo}}</ref>\n* Another socioeconomic factor is the change in the household family. The [[nuclear family]] is traditionally two parents and their children living under the same roof. In the past, households frequently inhibited extended family members such as grandparents. With the shift in the amount of people under one roof, there has been an increase in direct energy consumption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Malcolm|date=November 2012|title=Urban Consumption,edited by Peter W. Newton|journal=Urban Research & Practice|volume=5|issue=3|pages=369\u2013371|doi=10.1080/17535069.2012.727571|issn=1753-5069}}</ref> Less people per household means more households. People are shifting towards single person households as our societal norms evolve. More households mean more energy being used to do things like heat the house, power more T.V. 's, and use more lights. It also means more geographical land space being taken up by people which can lead to further urbanization of rural communities. This has been a shift in communities across the globe.\n* Deforestation, natural disasters, pollution and energy consumption explicitly exhibit how human and natural systems are integrated systems. They are influenced by government policies and contextual factors which often have a more negative impact on the environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=J.|last2=Dietz|first2=T.|last3=Carpenter|first3=S.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889,16 year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931<ref name=\":2\" />. During this time Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area<ref name=\":1\" />.  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7th, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt.

He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make.

A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures. In his yard hung a sign \"Tomb-Stones. For Sale. Garden. Ornaments.

His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.70</ref> Most of Edmonson's carved figures consisted of faces carved on a spherical base, with a small mouth resting directly under a vertical nose, following to connect to the curve of the brow.

In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery. \n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David C. Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889,16 year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931<ref name=\":2\" />. During this time Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area<ref name=\":1\" />.  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7th, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt. Ararat burial records of the period were lost in a fire, so his exact grave site is unknown.\n== Art Career ==\n[[File:Crucifix_ca._1932-1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|369x369px|\"Crucifixion\" ca. 1932-1937, carved limestone, gift from Elizabeth Gibbons-Hanson]]\nEdmondson entered the world of sculpture at the advanced age of about 60 years old in 1934. He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make.

A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures.

His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed.

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion

However, social security remained a reserved matter of the [[UK Government]] through the [[Department for Work and Pensions]].  The [[Smith Commission]] following the \u2018No\u2019 vote to independence in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 referendum]] recommended that authority over several areas of social security be transferred to the Scottish Parliament under a revised devolution settlement for Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_15-07_The_Smith_Commission_Welfare_Proposals.pdf|title=The Smith Commission's Welfare Proposals - Scottish Parliament|last=SPICe - Scottish Parliament|first=|date=21 January 2015|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis was put into statue through the [[Scotland Act 2016]].\n\n==Legislation==\n{{Main|Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018}}\n\nWith the Scotland Act 2016 transferring authority over some elements of social security, the Scottish Government introduced the Social Security (Scotland) Bill.  This Bill introduced a different approach to administering social security in Scotland compared to the approach of the United Kingdom.

Filmed in 1963 using a combination of electronic [[marionette]] puppetry and [[scale model]] special effects, it was APF's sixth puppet series and the third to be produced under the banner of \"[[Supermarionation]]\". It debuted on British television in October 1964.\n\nSet in the [[2060s]], the series follows the exploits of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a military organisation responsible for policing the Earth's oceans. The WASP's top vessel is ''Stingray'', a combat submarine piloted by the daring Captain Troy Tempest, aided by his loyal navigator, Lieutenant \"Phones\" Sheridan, and Marina, a young woman from under the sea. ''Stingray''{{'}}s adventures bring it into contact with various underwater civilisations, some friendly and others hostile, as well as mysterious natural phenomena.\n\nIn preparation for the series, APF acquired new, larger studios that it would continue to occupy for the remainder of the 1960s. Filmed at a cost of approximately \u00a31&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"O'Brien80\">O'Brien, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> ''Stingray'' was the first British TV series to be made entirely in colour,<ref name=\"Bentley2008,80\">Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;80.</ref><ref>La Rivi\u00e8re, p.&nbsp;96.</ref> a move intended to increase its appeal to the lucrative American market.<ref name=\"Rogers68\">Rogers et al., p.&nbsp;68.</ref><ref name=\"Peel240\">Peel, p.&nbsp;240.</ref><ref name=\"SangsterCondon\"/> The underwater sequences were filmed \"dry\" by shooting the sets through thin aquaria, while surface shots were filmed on water tanks incorporating lowered back walls to create artificial horizons. ''Stingray'' was the first Supermarionation series whose puppet characters were provided with interchangeable heads enabling them to show a variety of facial expressions.\n\n''Stingray''{{'}}s 39 half-hour episodes were originally broadcast on [[Associated Television]] in the United Kingdom and in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in North America. The series has drawn a largely positive response from commentators, some of whom have compared its premise to the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Stingray'', a [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered]] combat [[submarine]], is the [[flagship]] of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a branch of the World Security Patrol (WSP) responsible for policing the Earth's oceans in the mid-[[2060s]].<ref group=\"Note\">Sources give the year as 2064 (Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;88; Bentley 2001, p.&nbsp;12) or 2065 (Sellers, p.&nbsp;88). The episode \"The Lighthouse Dwellers\" is set in 2065 (La Rivi\u00e8re, p.&nbsp;103). The episode \"Eastern Eclipse\" is set 12 months after \"Star of the East\" (Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;92).</ref> Armed with \"sting missile\" [[torpedo]]es, it can travel at up to {{Convert|600|kn|kph mph}} underwater<ref name=\"Bentley2008,79\"/><ref name=\"Sellers90\">Sellers, p.&nbsp;90.</ref> and reach depths of over {{Convert|36000|ft|km mi}}.\n\nThe WASP is based in the self-contained city of Marineville, located several miles inland somewhere on the [[West Coast of North America]].<ref name=\"Bentley2008,79\"/><ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re2013\">{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|title=Time Machine: ''Stingray''|last1=La Rivi\u00e8re|first1=Stephen|editor1-last=Bradley|editor1-first=David|pages=76\u201377|date=May 2013|issue=233|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|location=Bath, UK|issn=1749-6969|oclc=813632043}}</ref> It is connected to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via a tunnel leading to an \"ocean door\", through which ''Stingray'' is launched. [[General quarters]] alerts are sounded by rapid drum beats played over the base's [[public address]] system. In emergency situations, the entire base is lowered into vast underground bunkers on giant hydraulic jacks while [[fighter aircraft]] and interceptor missiles are launched to counter threats. WASP personnel acknowledge commands with the phrase \"P.W.O.R.\" \u2013 short for \"Proceeding With Orders Received\".\n\n''Stingray'' is piloted by the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest. He is paired with [[American South|Southern]] navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \"Phones\" for his side role as ''Stingray''{{'}}s [[hydrophone]] operator. Troy and Phones board ''Stingray'' by sitting on twin seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are lowered into the submarine via injector tubes and then clamped into place. They answer to their \"[[Wheelchair|hoverchair]]\"-bound Commander Sam Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, works in the Marineville control tower and is enamoured of Troy.\n\nThe series begins with the WASP's discovery that the ocean floor is home to many advanced civilisations. Prominent among these is the undersea city of Titanica, ruled by King Titan. A despot, Titan commands the Aquaphibians who possess a fleet of lethal submersibles called \"Mechanical Fish\".<ref group=\"Note\">In [[tie-in]] media, they are called \"Terror Fish\" (Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;355).</ref> In the first episode, ''Stingray'' is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave, Marina, a [[Muteness|mute]] young woman from the undersea city of Pacifica who can breathe underwater.\n\nTroy and Phones take Marina to Marineville, where she becomes a permanent member of the ''Stingray'' crew. Troy becomes infatuated with her, making Atlanta jealous. Meanwhile, Titan, furious at Marina's betrayal, vows revenge on \"terraineans\" (land people) in general and Troy and the WASP in particular.\n\nMany later episodes revolve around Titan's unsuccessful schemes to destroy ''Stingray'' and Marineville, which usually fail due to the incompetence of Surface Agent X-2-Zero, his spy on land. X-2-Zero is based on the Pacific island of Lemoy, where he lives in an outwardly  dilapidated house whose walls conceal banks of highly sophisticated surveillance and tracking equipment. Other episodes feature encounters with other races living under the sea or within the Earth (some friendly and others hostile), as well as investigation of natural phenomena. The final episode is a [[clip show]] in which Troy is named \"Aquanaut of the Year\" and a selection of ''Stingray''{{'}}s adventures are recalled as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|overall=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|airdateT=Original air date ([[ATV London]])\n|airdateR=<ref name=\"Bentley2008,81-93\">Bentley 2008, pp.&nbsp;81\u201393.</ref>\n|prodcodeR=<ref name=\"Bentley2008,81-93\"/>\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Stingray\n|RTitle=<ref group=\"Note\">The first episode has no on-screen title but is referred to as \"Stingray\" in documentation by distributor [[ITC Entertainment]] (Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;97).

Cull names \"Marineville Traitor\", which focuses on a hunt for an \"enemy within\", as one episode with an \"especially strong Cold War flavour\". He also notes that while Anderson's productions often depict [[nuclear technology]] as a hazard, ''Stingray'' also portrays it in a positive light: the ''Stingray'' submarine itself, for example, is nuclear-powered.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cull | first1 = Nicholas J. | author1-link = Nicholas J.

Filmed in 1963 using a combination of electronic [[marionette]] puppetry and [[scale model]] special effects, it was APF's sixth puppet series and the third to be produced under the banner of \"[[Supermarionation]]\". It debuted on British television in October 1964.\n\nSet in the [[2060s]], the series follows the exploits of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a military organisation responsible for policing the Earth's oceans. The WASP's top vessel is ''Stingray'', a combat submarine piloted by the daring Captain Troy Tempest, aided by his loyal navigator, Lieutenant \"Phones\", and Marina, a young woman from under the sea. ''Stingray''{{'}}s adventures bring it into contact with various underwater civilisations, some friendly and others hostile, as well as mysterious natural phenomena.\n\nIn preparation for the series, APF acquired new, larger studios that it would continue to occupy for the remainder of the 1960s. Filmed at a cost of approximately \u00a31&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"O'Brien80\">O'Brien, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> ''Stingray'' was the first British TV series to be made entirely in colour,<ref name=\"Bentley2008,80\">Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;80.</ref><ref>La Rivi\u00e8re, p.&nbsp;96.</ref> a move intended to increase its appeal to the lucrative American market.<ref name=\"Rogers68\">Rogers et al., p.&nbsp;68.</ref><ref name=\"Peel240\">Peel, p.&nbsp;240.</ref><ref name=\"SangsterCondon\"/> The underwater sequences were filmed \"dry\" by shooting the sets through thin aquaria, while surface shots were filmed on water tanks incorporating lowered back walls to create artificial horizons. ''Stingray'' was the first Supermarionation series whose puppet characters were provided with interchangeable heads enabling them to show a variety of facial expressions.\n\n''Stingray''{{'}}s 39 half-hour episodes were originally broadcast on [[Associated Television]] in the United Kingdom and in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in North America. The series has drawn a largely positive response from commentators, some of whom have compared its premise to the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Stingray'', a [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered]] combat [[submarine]], is the [[flagship]] of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a branch of the World Security Patrol (WSP) responsible for policing the Earth's oceans in the mid-[[2060s]].<ref group=\"Note\">Sources give the year as 2064 (Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;88; Bentley 2001, p.&nbsp;12) or 2065 (Sellers, p.&nbsp;88). The episode \"The Lighthouse Dwellers\" is set in 2065 (La Rivi\u00e8re, p.&nbsp;103). The episode \"Eastern Eclipse\" is set 12 months after \"Star of the East\" (Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;92).</ref> Armed with \"sting missile\" [[torpedo]]es, it can travel at up to {{Convert|600|kn|kph mph}} underwater<ref name=\"Bentley2008,79\"/><ref name=\"Sellers90\">Sellers, p.&nbsp;90.</ref> and reach depths of over {{Convert|36000|ft|km mi}}.\n\nThe WASP is based in the self-contained city of Marineville, located several miles inland somewhere on the [[West Coast of North America]].<ref name=\"Bentley2008,79\"/><ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re2013\">{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|title=Time Machine: ''Stingray''|last1=La Rivi\u00e8re|first1=Stephen|editor1-last=Bradley|editor1-first=David|pages=76\u201377|date=May 2013|issue=233|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|location=Bath, UK|issn=1749-6969|oclc=813632043}}</ref> It is connected to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via a tunnel leading to an \"ocean door\", through which ''Stingray'' is launched. [[General quarters]] alerts are sounded by rapid drum beats played over the base's [[public address]] system. In emergency situations, the entire base is lowered into vast underground bunkers on giant hydraulic jacks while [[fighter aircraft]] and interceptor missiles are launched to counter threats. WASP personnel acknowledge commands with the phrase \"P.W.O.R.\" \u2013 short for \"Proceeding With Orders Received\".\n\n''Stingray'' is piloted by the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest. He is paired with [[American South|Southern]] navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \"Phones\" for his side role as ''Stingray''{{'}}s [[hydrophone]] operator. Troy and Phones board ''Stingray'' by sitting on twin seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are lowered into the submarine via injector tubes and then clamped into place. They answer to their \"[[Wheelchair|hoverchair]]\"-bound Commander Sam Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, works in the Marineville control tower and is enamoured of Troy.\n\nThe series begins with the WASP's discovery that the ocean floor is home to many advanced civilisations. Prominent among these is the undersea city of Titanica, ruled by King Titan. A despot, Titan commands the Aquaphibians who possess a fleet of lethal submersibles called \"Mechanical Fish\".<ref group=\"Note\">In [[tie-in]] media, they are called \"Terror Fish\" (Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;355).</ref> In the first episode, ''Stingray'' is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave, Marina, a [[Muteness|mute]] young woman from the undersea city of Pacifica who can breathe underwater.\n\nTroy and Phones take Marina to Marineville, where she becomes a permanent member of the ''Stingray'' crew. Troy becomes infatuated with her, making Atlanta jealous. Meanwhile, Titan, furious at Marina's betrayal, vows revenge on \"terraineans\" (land people) in general and Troy and the WASP in particular.\n\nMany later episodes revolve around Titan's unsuccessful schemes to destroy ''Stingray'' and Marineville, which usually fail due to the incompetence of Surface Agent X-2-Zero, his spy on land. X-2-Zero is based on the Pacific island of Lemoy, where he lives in an outwardly  dilapidated house whose walls conceal banks of highly sophisticated surveillance and tracking equipment. Other episodes feature encounters with other races living under the sea or within the Earth (some friendly and others hostile), as well as investigation of natural phenomena. The final episode is a [[clip show]] in which Troy is named \"Aquanaut of the Year\" and a selection of ''Stingray''{{'}}s adventures are recalled as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|overall=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|airdateT=Original air date ([[ATV London]])\n|airdateR=<ref name=\"Bentley2008,81-93\">Bentley 2008, pp.&nbsp;81\u201393.</ref>\n|prodcodeR=<ref name=\"Bentley2008,81-93\"/>\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Stingray\n|RTitle=<ref group=\"Note\">The first episode has no on-screen title but is referred to as \"Stingray\" in documentation by distributor [[ITC Entertainment]] (Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;97).

Cull names \"Marineville Traitor\", which focuses on a hunt for an \"enemy within\", as one episode with an \"especially strong Cold War flavour\".

Known also as the Old North Road, it was a major coaching route to the north, exiting the City at [[Bishopsgate]]. The east\u2013west course of Old Street\u2013Hackney Road was also probably originally a Roman Road, connecting [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] with [[Camulodunum|Colchester]], bypassing the City of London to the south.<ref>Sugden n.d.</ref>\n\nShoreditch Church (officially known as [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]) is of ancient origin. It is featured in the famous line \"when I grow rich say the bells of Shoreditch\", from the English nursery rhyme \"[[Oranges and Lemons]]\".\n\nShoreditch was the site of a house of canonesses, the [[Augustinian]] [[Holywell Priory]] (named after a Holy Well on the site), from the 12th century until its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1539. This priory was located between Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road to east and west, and Batemans Row and Holywell Lane to north and south.

Even so, they drew the wrath of contemporary moralists, as did the local \"base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort\" and the \"great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses\".<ref>Middlesex Justices in 1596; cited in Schoenbaum 1987, p. 126.</ref>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the 17th century, wealthy traders and French [[Huguenot]] silkweavers moved to the area, establishing a textile industry centred to the south around Spitalfields.

There was considerable rivalry with the West End theatres. John Douglass (the owner, from 1845) wrote a letter to ''The Era'' following a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] first night, in which he commented that \"seeing that a hansom cab is used in the new drama at Drury Lane, I beg to state that a hansom cab, drawn by a live horse was used in my drama ... produced at the Standard Theatre ... with real rain, a real flood, and a real balloon.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoreditch Theatres and Halls|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Shoreditch.htm|website=Arthur Lloyd|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* The Shoreditch Empire, also known as The London Music Hall, 95\u201399 Shoreditch High Street (1856\u20131935).

Often conflated with its neighbouring sub-district of Hoxton, the area has been subject to considerable [[gentrification]], with accompanying rises in land and property prices. Former industrial buildings have been converted to offices and flats, while Curtain Road and Old Street are notable for their clubs and pubs which offer a variety of venues to rival those of the West End. Art galleries, bars, restaurants, media businesses and the building of the [[Hackney Community College]] campus are features of this transformation.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the main streets of Shoreditch (Old Street, Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road, Great Eastern Street) were formed into a mile-long one-way system, which became associated with traffic congestion, poor conditions for walking and cycling, high speeds, high collision rates, and delays for bus services. The gyratory system came to be seen as \"the main factor holding back the cultural regeneration of South Shoreditch\"<ref>Teo Greenstraat of [[The Circus Space]], quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> and \"a block to economic recovery\".<ref>Michael Pyner of Shoreditch New Deal Trust, quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> Following a lengthy campaign,<ref>[http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm ''The long road back to a two-way Shoreditch''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727072432/http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm |date=27 July 2011 }} Hackney Cyclists, 2002.</ref> the then newly formed [[Transport for London]] agreed to revert most of the streets to two-way working, a project which was completed in late 2002.\n\n[[File:Shoreditch High Street stn entrance2 April2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shoreditch High Street railway station]], built as part of the [[East London Line extension]].]]\nIn 2005, funding was announced for the [[East London Line Extension]], to extend the existing tube line from [[Whitechapel tube station]] bypassing [[Shoreditch tube station]], and to create a new station named [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street]] closer to central Shoreditch.

These include [[Last.fm]], [[Dopplr]], [[Songkick]], [[SocialGO]] and [[7digital]]. These companies have tended to gravitate towards [[Old Street Roundabout]], giving rise to the term \"Silicon Roundabout\" to describe the area, as used by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] in a speech in November 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|title=Transcript: David Cameron sets out Britain's hi-tech future|author=Duncan Geere|magazine=Wired|access-date=9 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323164624/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, the name of Shoreditch has become synonymous with the concept of contemporary \"[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsterfication]]\" of regenerated urban areas.

The north-eastern part of the map is part of the parish of Shoreditch]]\nShoreditch covers a wide area, but its historic heart lies south of Old Street, around [[Shoreditch High Street]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch Church]]. The districts of [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] have been historically part of Shoreditch since the medieval period and occupy the north-west and north-east of Shoreditch respectively; however, their extent has never been formally defined.\n\nAlthough Shoreditch has been consistently defined, perceptions have blurred in recent years; something that became possible after the [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]] amalgamated with some of its neighbours to become the southern part of the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965.\n\nThe location of the former [[Shoreditch tube station]] (closed 2006), 400 metres outside Shoreditch proper, in nearby [[Bethnal Green]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], influenced this shift. Its replacement, [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street station]], straddles the borough boundary.\n\nMore significant has been the gentrification of the Shoreditch area since the millennium, leading to a marked increase in the area's prestige, which has led businesses in the [[Bethnal Green]] and [[Spitalfields]] areas of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] to include the name Shoreditch in their company's name and marketing material. This is also seen to a lesser extent in the [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] area of the [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Shoreditch Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|right|A map showing the wards of Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nShoreditch was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the [[Middle Ages]] until its merger into the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965. Shoreditch was based for many centuries on the [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Shoreditch (parish)|Shoreditch (St Leonard's)]], part of the county of [[Middlesex]].\n\nParishes in Middlesex were grouped into [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]], with Shoreditch part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Shoreditch part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The Tower Division was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref> - an arrangement which continued until 1899.\n\nThe [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parishes]] provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n \nFor civil purposes, The [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] turned turned the parish area into a new ''Shoreditch District of the Metropolis'', with the same boundaries as the parish. The [[London Government Act 1899]] converted these areas into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s, again based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations. The Borough's areas of Central Shoreditch, [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] were administered from Shoreditch Town Hall, which can still be seen on Old Street. It has been restored and is now run by the Shoreditch Town Hall Trust.\n\nIn 1965, Shoreditch was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n===Governance===\nShoreditch is home to the [[Nat Wei, Baron Wei|Baron of Shoreditch Wei]], who lives in the area and sits as a\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[life peer]] and [[Lords Temporal]] as [[Members of the House of Lords|part]] of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u8996\u983b\uff1a\u82f1\u570b\u83ef\u88d4\u7537\u7235\u97cb\u9cf4\u6069\u5c08\u8a2a\u4e00|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/multimedia/2010/06/100616_vid_nat_wei_1.shtml|work=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 September 2011|author=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|authorlink=BBC|date=17 June 2010|trans-title=Video: British Chinese baron Nat Wei Exclusive Interview 1}}</ref> He was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] on 3 June 2010.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59437 |date=3 June 2010 |page=10273 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100603-0001.htm#10060340000777 |title=House of Lords debates (3 June 2010, 11:00&nbsp;am): Introduction: Lord Wei |publisher=Hansard : House of Lords : 3 June 2010 : Column 365 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official portrait of Meg Hillier crop 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Official portrait of [[Meg Hillier]] ([[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]) of [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]].]]\nThe Hackney borough part of Shoreditch is part of the [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]] constituency, represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2005 by [[Meg Hillier]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of the [[Co-operative Party]]\n\nThe eastern part of Shoreditch, in Tower Hamlets, lies within the constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], represented since 2010 by [[Rushanara Ali]] of the Labour Party.\n\n== Notable local residents ==\n{{Main|List of people from Hackney}}\n*[[Andrew Weatherall]], DJ, producer, and remixer\n*[[Anissa Helou]], cookbook author, teacher and chef specialising in the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa\n*[[Barbara Windsor]], comedian, film and television actress was born there.\n*[[Bill Meyer (artist)|Bill Meyer]], printmaker and artist\n*[[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Playwright|dramatist]] lived in [[Norton Folgate]], the southern continuation of Shoreditch High Street, and wrote plays for the Shoreditch theatres.\n*[[Damien Hirst]], artist; instrumental in the development of the area's art scene in the early 1990s\n*[[Emmanuel Ray]], TV presenter/socialite\n*[[Henry Hate]], celebrity tattoo artist; clients include [[Boy George]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Pete Doherty]]\n*[[Hetty King]], a famous male impersonator of the [[music hall]], was born here.

Known also as the Old North Road, it was a major coaching route to the north, exiting the City at [[Bishopsgate]]. The east\u2013west course of Old Street\u2013Hackney Road was also probably originally a Roman Road, connecting [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] with [[Camulodunum|Colchester]], bypassing the City of London to the south.<ref>Sugden n.d.</ref>\n\nShoreditch Church (officially known as [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]) is of ancient origin. It is featured in the famous line \"when I grow rich say the bells of Shoreditch\", from the English nursery rhyme \"[[Oranges and Lemons]]\".\n\nShoreditch was the site of a house of canonesses, the [[Augustinian]] [[Holywell Priory]] (named after a Holy Well on the site), from the 12th century until its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1539. This priory was located between Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road to east and west, and Batemans Row and Holywell Lane to north and south.

Even so, they drew the wrath of contemporary moralists, as did the local \"base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort\" and the \"great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses\".<ref>Middlesex Justices in 1596; cited in Schoenbaum 1987, p. 126.</ref>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the 17th century, wealthy traders and French [[Huguenot]] silkweavers moved to the area, establishing a textile industry centred to the south around Spitalfields.

There was considerable rivalry with the West End theatres. John Douglass (the owner, from 1845) wrote a letter to ''The Era'' following a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] first night, in which he commented that \"seeing that a hansom cab is used in the new drama at Drury Lane, I beg to state that a hansom cab, drawn by a live horse was used in my drama ... produced at the Standard Theatre ... with real rain, a real flood, and a real balloon.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoreditch Theatres and Halls|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Shoreditch.htm|website=Arthur Lloyd|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* The Shoreditch Empire, also known as The London Music Hall, 95\u201399 Shoreditch High Street (1856\u20131935).

Often conflated with its neighbouring sub-district of Hoxton, the area has been subject to considerable [[gentrification]], with accompanying rises in land and property prices. Former industrial buildings have been converted to offices and flats, while Curtain Road and Old Street are notable for their clubs and pubs which offer a variety of venues to rival those of the West End. Art galleries, bars, restaurants, media businesses and the building of the [[Hackney Community College]] campus are features of this transformation.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the main streets of Shoreditch (Old Street, Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road, Great Eastern Street) were formed into a mile-long one-way system, which became associated with traffic congestion, poor conditions for walking and cycling, high speeds, high collision rates, and delays for bus services. The gyratory system came to be seen as \"the main factor holding back the cultural regeneration of South Shoreditch\"<ref>Teo Greenstraat of [[The Circus Space]], quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> and \"a block to economic recovery\".<ref>Michael Pyner of Shoreditch New Deal Trust, quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> Following a lengthy campaign,<ref>[http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm ''The long road back to a two-way Shoreditch''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727072432/http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm |date=27 July 2011 }} Hackney Cyclists, 2002.</ref> the then newly formed [[Transport for London]] agreed to revert most of the streets to two-way working, a project which was completed in late 2002.\n\n[[File:Shoreditch High Street stn entrance2 April2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shoreditch High Street railway station]], built as part of the [[East London Line extension]].]]\nIn 2005, funding was announced for the [[East London Line Extension]], to extend the existing tube line from [[Whitechapel tube station]] bypassing [[Shoreditch tube station]], and to create a new station named [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street]] closer to central Shoreditch.

These include [[Last.fm]], [[Dopplr]], [[Songkick]], [[SocialGO]] and [[7digital]]. These companies have tended to gravitate towards [[Old Street Roundabout]], giving rise to the term \"Silicon Roundabout\" to describe the area, as used by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] in a speech in November 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|title=Transcript: David Cameron sets out Britain's hi-tech future|author=Duncan Geere|magazine=Wired|access-date=9 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323164624/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, the name of Shoreditch has become synonymous with the concept of contemporary \"[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsterfication]]\" of regenerated urban areas.

The north-eastern part of the map is part of the parish of Shoreditch]]\nShoreditch covers a wide area, but its historic heart lies south of Old Street, around [[Shoreditch High Street]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch Church]]. The districts of [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] have been historically part of Shoreditch since the medieval period and occupy the north-west and north-east of Shoreditch respectively; however, their extent has never been formally defined.\n\nAlthough Shoreditch has been consistently defined, perceptions have blurred in recent years; something that became possible after the [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]] amalgamated with some of its neighbours to become the southern part of the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965.\n\nThe location of the former [[Shoreditch tube station]] (closed 2006), 400 metres outside Shoreditch proper, in nearby [[Bethnal Green]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], influenced this shift. Its replacement, [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street station]], straddles the borough boundary.\n\nMore significant has been the gentrification of the Shoreditch area since the millennium, leading to a marked increase in the area's prestige, which has led businesses in the [[Bethnal Green]] and [[Spitalfields]] areas of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] to include the name Shoreditch in their company's name and marketing material. This is also seen to a lesser extent in the [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] area of the [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Shoreditch Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|right|A map showing the wards of Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nShoreditch was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the [[Middle Ages]] until its merger into the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965. Shoreditch was based for many centuries on the [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Shoreditch (parish)|Shoreditch (St Leonard's)]], part of the county of [[Middlesex]].\n\nParishes in Middlesex were grouped into [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]], with Shoreditch part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Shoreditch part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The Tower Division was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref> - an arrangement which continued until 1899.\n\nThe [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parishes]] provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n \nFor civil purposes, The [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] turned turned the parish area into a new ''Shoreditch District of the Metropolis'', with the same boundaries as the parish. The [[London Government Act 1899]] converted these areas into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s, again based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations. The Borough's areas of Central Shoreditch, [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] were administered from Shoreditch Town Hall, which can still be seen on Old Street. It has been restored and is now run by the Shoreditch Town Hall Trust.\n\nIn 1965, Shoreditch was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n===Governance===\nShoreditch is home to the [[Nat Wei, Baron Wei|Baron of Shoreditch Wei]], who lives in the area and sits as a\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[life peer]] and [[Lords Temporal]] as [[Members of the House of Lords|part]] of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u8996\u983b\uff1a\u82f1\u570b\u83ef\u88d4\u7537\u7235\u97cb\u9cf4\u6069\u5c08\u8a2a\u4e00|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/multimedia/2010/06/100616_vid_nat_wei_1.shtml|work=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 September 2011|author=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|authorlink=BBC|date=17 June 2010|trans-title=Video: British Chinese baron Nat Wei Exclusive Interview 1}}</ref> He was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] on 3 June 2010.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59437 |date=3 June 2010 |page=10273 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100603-0001.htm#10060340000777 |title=House of Lords debates (3 June 2010, 11:00&nbsp;am): Introduction: Lord Wei |publisher=Hansard : House of Lords : 3 June 2010 : Column 365 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official portrait of Meg Hillier crop 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Official portrait of [[Meg Hillier]] ([[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]) of [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]].]]\nThe Hackney borough part of Shoreditch is part of the [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]] constituency, represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2005 by [[Meg Hillier]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of the [[Co-operative Party]]\n\nThe eastern part of Shoreditch, in Tower Hamlets, lies within the constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], represented since 2010 by [[Rushanara Ali]] of the Labour Party.\n\n== Notable local residents ==\n{{Main|List of people from Hackney}}\n*[[Andrew Weatherall]], DJ, producer, and remixer\n*[[Anissa Helou]], cookbook author, teacher and chef specialising in the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa\n*[[Barbara Windsor]], comedian, film and television actress was born there.\n*[[Bill Meyer (artist)|Bill Meyer]], printmaker and artist\n*[[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Playwright|dramatist]] lived in [[Norton Folgate]], the southern continuation of Shoreditch High Street, and wrote plays for the Shoreditch theatres.\n*[[Damien Hirst]], artist; instrumental in the development of the area's art scene in the early 1990s\n*[[Emmanuel Ray]], TV presenter/socialite\n*[[Henry Hate]], celebrity tattoo artist; clients include [[Boy George]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Pete Doherty]]\n*[[Hetty King]], a famous male impersonator of the [[music hall]], was born here.

[[Waterford City and County Council]] is the local government authority for the city. According to the 2016 Census, 53,504 people live in the city, with a wider metropolitan population of 82,963.\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glassmaking industry. Glass, or crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009, when the factory there was shut down after the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc. The Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the Viking Quarter, under new owners, opened in June 2010, after the intervention of Waterford City Council and Waterford Chamber of Commerce, and resumed production. Waterford is also known for being the starting point of [[Ryanair]]'s first flight, a 14-seat [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante|Embraer Bandeirante]] [[turboprop]] aircraft flying between Waterford and [[Gatwick Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Waterford}}\n[[File:Waterford city at night - geograph.org.uk - 1034017.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Waterford Quay at night]]\n\nThe name 'Waterford' comes {{etymology|non|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r|[[Sheep|ram]] (wether) [[fjord]]}}. The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003. Held by the De La Salle College Malvern Archives</ref> In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between [[Irish Free State]] and [[Irish Republican]] troops during the [[Irish Civil War]].\n\n===References in Annals of Inisfallen===\nSee [[Annals of Inisfallen]] (AI)\n* ''AI926.2 The fleet of Port L\u00e1irge [came] over land, and they settled on [[Lough Gur|Loch Gair]].''\n* ''AI927.2 A slaughter of the foreigners of Port L\u00e1irge [was inflicted] at Cell Mo-Chell\u00f3c by the men of [[Munster|Mumu]] and by the foreigners of [[Limerick|Luimnech]].''\n* ''AI984.2 A great naval expedition(?) by the sons of [[Ivar of Limerick|Aralt]] to Port L\u00e1irge, and they and the [[Brian Boru|son of Cenn\u00e9tig]] exchanged hostages there as a guarantee of both together providing a hosting to attack [[Dublin|\u00c1th Cliath]].

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. The [[River Suir]], which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day.

[[Kilmeadan]], about 5&nbsp;km from the city, was home to a very successful [[co-operative]]. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the [[hedge fund]] office of the [[Citibank]] resided here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013|title=50 jobs lost as Citi Bank announce Waterford office closure|first=Christina|last=Finn|website=Thejournal.ie|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022108/http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013/|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=21st Century Business Revised Edition|last=Murphy|first=William|publisher=CJ Fallon|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7144-1923-7|location=Ground Floor \u2013 Block B, Liffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22|pages=437|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Waterford}}\n\nThe [[M9 motorway (Ireland)|M9 motorway]], which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|title=M9 Motorway|author=Irish Motorway Info|work=irishmotorwayinfo.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075015/http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] road connects the city to [[Limerick]] city.

The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003. Held by the De La Salle College Malvern Archives</ref> In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between [[Irish Free State]] and [[Irish Republican]] troops during the [[Irish Civil War]].\n\n===References in Annals of Inisfallen===\nSee [[Annals of Inisfallen]] (AI)\n* ''AI926.2 The fleet of Port L\u00e1irge [came] over land, and they settled on [[Lough Gur|Loch Gair]].''\n* ''AI927.2 A slaughter of the foreigners of Port L\u00e1irge [was inflicted] at Cell Mo-Chell\u00f3c by the men of [[Munster|Mumu]] and by the foreigners of [[Limerick|Luimnech]].''\n* ''AI984.2 A great naval expedition(?) by the sons of [[Ivar of Limerick|Aralt]] to Port L\u00e1irge, and they and the [[Brian Boru|son of Cenn\u00e9tig]] exchanged hostages there as a guarantee of both together providing a hosting to attack [[Dublin|\u00c1th Cliath]].

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. The [[River Suir]], which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry.

The new name reflected a change in instrumentation including flutes, saxophones, oboes and a full percussion section which led to more members joining and a wider variety of music being played. In 1994 the band won the All Ireland Senior Military Band Championships in [[Wesley College (Dublin)|Wesley college]], Dublin under the Baton of Mr Niall O'Connor and 10 years later, in 2004, the band won the South of Ireland Senior Military band Championships in Clonakilty Co Cork under the Baton of the band's current musical director Mr Mark Fitzgerald.\n* '''Waterford Film For All''' (WFFA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfordfilmforall.com/|title=WFFA \u2013 Waterford Film For All|website=Waterfordfilmforall.com|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525101057/http://www.waterfordfilmforall.com/|archivedate=25 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is a non-profit film society whose aim is to offer an alternative to the cineplex experience in Waterford.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day. Places where Waterford Crystal can be seen include New York City, where Waterford Crystal made the 2,668 crystals for the famous New Year's Eve Ball that is dropped each year in [[Times Square]]; [[Westminster Abbey]]; [[Windsor Castle]]; and the [[Kennedy Center]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref>Beeson, Trevor (2002).

[[Kilmeadan]], about 5&nbsp;km from the city, was home to a very successful [[co-operative]]. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the [[hedge fund]] office of the [[Citibank]] resided here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013|title=50 jobs lost as Citi Bank announce Waterford office closure|first=Christina|last=Finn|website=Thejournal.ie|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022108/http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013/|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=21st Century Business Revised Edition|last=Murphy|first=William|publisher=CJ Fallon|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7144-1923-7|location=Ground Floor \u2013 Block B, Liffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22|pages=437|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Waterford}}\n\nThe [[M9 motorway (Ireland)|M9 motorway]], which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|title=M9 Motorway|author=Irish Motorway Info|work=irishmotorwayinfo.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075015/http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] road connects the city to [[Limerick]] city.

He also published a translation of two of the orders of the Mishna into German.\n\nMost of his writings were in German and remain so to this day. ''The First Mishna'' was translated into English, and a selection of his comments on the [[Passover Haggada]] have been published in Hebrew as well.

It started as an oasis around a series of watering holes eight miles north of present-day Maricopa, and about a mile west of Pima Butte. European-American traders and travelers called it Maricopa Wells. Several of Arizona\u2019s rivers, the Gila, Santa Cruz, Vekol and Santa Rosa provided this oasis in the desert with an ample supply of water during this period of time.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, Maricopa Wells was one of the most important relay stations along the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]] and the later more famous [[Butterfield Overland Mail in New Mexico Territory#3rd Division|Butterfield Overland Mail]] Route.  Although little remains of this once bustling community, it played an important part in the progress and development of the Southwest. It was one of the best-known spots in Arizona during this period of time because it had a reliable source of water, and offered an abundant supply of food. The peaceful Pima and Maricopa farmers who lived and farmed nearby sold supplies to travelers and migrants.\n\nThe most prosperous period of time for Maricopa Wells was in the 1870s. During this time the trading center at the Wells provided water and food for not only the east-west travelers, but those who traveled to the north to Phoenix. Fairly good roads had been built by James A. Moore, the proprietor at Maricopa Wells, to all points north, and the Wells was a constant hubbub of activity.\n\nMaricopaville developed south and west of the Wells, following construction of a railroad line from this terminus to Phoenix. In 1879, the Southern Pacific Railroad was in the process of building a railroad line from Yuma to Tucson, and a second railroad line was to be built from Maricopaville, wrapping around the western edge of South Mountain into [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. With the railroad, Maricopaville took on the appearance of a gold rush California boom town, as men worked day and night building hotels, saloons, warehouses, restaurants, theaters, etc.  One newspaper of the time reckoned that with its thousands of people and good location, Maricopaville would be an ideal choice for the location of the state capital.\n\nBut the railroad never built the anticipated line from Maricopaville into Phoenix.  [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] also wanted to be on the railroad line and lobbied the territorial government to gain a stop. Officials agreed. The settlement known as Maricopaville was essentially rebuilt three miles to the east (to the present location of Maricopa) in the early 1880s, in order to accommodate the Maricopa & Phoenix line, planned to go through Kyrene and Tempe to the north on the way to Phoenix. The first train departed from Maricopa for Phoenix on July 4, 1887. All east-west rail travelers had to stop at Maricopa, and those who wanted to go north had to shift to the M & P Railroad.<ref>''Reflections of a Desert Town'', Patricia Brock</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopachamber.org/futureresident/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916061444/http://www.maricopachamber.org/futureresident/history.php |archivedate=September 16, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmaricopa.com/COMMUNITY/History/tabid/131/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723195058/http://www.inmaricopa.com/COMMUNITY/History/tabid/131/Default.aspx |archivedate=July 23, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMaricopa was officially incorporated as a city on October 15, 2003, becoming the 88th incorporated municipality in Arizona.

It started as an oasis around a series of watering holes eight miles north of present-day Maricopa, and about a mile west of Pima Butte. European-American traders and travelers called it Maricopa Wells. Several of Arizona\u2019s rivers, the Gila, Santa Cruz, Vekol and Santa Rosa provided this oasis in the desert with an ample supply of water during this period of time.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, Maricopa Wells was one of the most important relay stations along the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]] and the later more famous [[Butterfield Overland Mail in New Mexico Territory#3rd Division|Butterfield Overland Mail]] Route.  Although little remains of this once bustling community, it played an important part in the progress and development of the Southwest. It was one of the best-known spots in Arizona during this period of time because it had a reliable source of water, and offered an abundant supply of food. The peaceful Pima and Maricopa farmers who lived and farmed nearby sold supplies to travelers and migrants.\n\nThe most prosperous period of time for Maricopa Wells was in the 1870s. During this time the trading center at the Wells provided water and food for not only the east-west travelers, but those who traveled to the north to Phoenix. Fairly good roads had been built by James A. Moore, the proprietor at Maricopa Wells, to all points north, and the Wells was a constant hubbub of activity.\n\nMaricopaville developed south and west of the Wells, following construction of a railroad line from this terminus to Phoenix. In 1879, the Southern Pacific Railroad was in the process of building a railroad line from Yuma to Tucson, and a second railroad line was to be built from Maricopaville, wrapping around the western edge of South Mountain into [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. With the railroad, Maricopaville took on the appearance of a gold rush California boom town, as men worked day and night building hotels, saloons, warehouses, restaurants, theaters, etc.  One newspaper of the time reckoned that with its thousands of people and good location, Maricopaville would be an ideal choice for the location of the state capital.\n\nBut the railroad never built the anticipated line from Maricopaville into Phoenix.  [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] also wanted to be on the railroad line and lobbied the territorial government to gain a stop. Officials agreed. The settlement known as Maricopaville was essentially rebuilt three miles to the east (to the present location of Maricopa) in the early 1880s, in order to accommodate the Maricopa & Phoenix line, planned to go through Kyrene and Tempe to the north on the way to Phoenix. The first train departed from Maricopa for Phoenix on July 4, 1887. All east-west rail travelers had to stop at Maricopa, and those who wanted to go north had to shift to the M & P Railroad.<ref>''Reflections of a Desert Town'', Patricia Brock</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopachamber.org/futureresident/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916061444/http://www.maricopachamber.org/futureresident/history.php |archivedate=September 16, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmaricopa.com/COMMUNITY/History/tabid/131/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723195058/http://www.inmaricopa.com/COMMUNITY/History/tabid/131/Default.aspx |archivedate=July 23, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMaricopa was officially incorporated as a city on October 15, 2003, becoming the 88th incorporated municipality in Arizona.

As it leaves the city for the [[Gila River Indian Community]] to the north or the [[Ak-Chin Indian Community]] to the south, the road changes names to Maricopa Road. A portion of old State Route 347 within Maricopa also exists as Maricopa Road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinalcentral.com/maricopa_monitor/news/addresses-for-maricopa-road-properties-to-officially-change-dec/article_069a5354-dc5b-549e-8ce7-52636a887fe4.html|title=Addresses for Maricopa Road properties to officially change Dec. 1|last=|first=|date=|website=PinalCentral|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMaricopa is also served by [[Arizona State Route 238]], which connects Maricopa to the town of [[Mobile, Arizona|Mobile]], which is incorporated into the city of [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]]. Past Mobile, State Route 238 becomes a county route that connects to [[Arizona State Route 85]] in [[Gila Bend, Arizona|Gila Bend]]. State Route 238 and Mobile Road designations are used interchangeably. State Route 238 ends at State Route 347, and continues east as Smith-Enke Road, a major east-west corridor for the city of Maricopa. Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway also makes up a major corridor for the city, connecting it to the city of [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]]. This road parallels the Union Pacific Railroad at a diagonal, ultimately becoming Plainview Street within Maricopa and Cottonwood Lane in Casa Grande.\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:California-Zephyr-MaricopaAZ.JPG|thumb|California Zephyr railcar at the Maricopa, AZ [[Amtrak]] station]]Maricopa is located on a Union Pacific Railroad line. The city is currently the closest stop to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] on [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' and ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' trains. The [[Maricopa (Amtrak station)|Maricopa depot]] opened in 2001, originally in a converted passenger rail car but now in a metal building.\n\n=== Utilities ===\nMaricopa is served by the following utilities:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maricopa-az.gov/our-city/residents/utilities-services-in-maricopa|title=Utilities & Services in Maricopa|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Maricopa, AZ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n* Cable: Orbitel Communications\n* Electricity: Electrical District #3\n* Natural Gas: [[Southwest Gas]]\n* Telephone/DSL: [[CenturyLink]]\n* Water: Global Water (Santa Cruz Water Company, Palo Verde Utilities), Maricopa Domestic Water Improvement District\n\n=== Bus ===\nThe City of Maricopa operates the City Of Maricopa Express Transit (COMET), which provides local bus service.<ref>{{Cite web| title = COMET Transit System {{!}} Maricopa, AZ| accessdate = 2020-02-03| url = https://www.maricopa-az.gov/departments/development-services/transportation/comet-transit-system}}</ref>\n\n==Municipal organization==\nMaricopa is governed by a Council-Manager form of government. This type of government structure combines the political leadership of elected officials with the managerial experience of an appointed professional manager. The City Council and City Manager work as partners to direct and guide local government.\n\nThe Maricopa City Council consists of the Mayor and six City Council members. The Mayor is elected to serve a four-year term and the City Council members are elected to serve four-year terms on a rotating basis. City Council meetings are held on the first and third Tuesdays of the month.\n\nThere are 10 citizen advisory groups that guide the Maricopa City Council on a myriad of activity. They are the Board of Adjustment, Heritage District Advisory Committee, Industrial Development Authority Board, Merit Board, Parks, Recreation and Library Advisory Committee, Planning and Zoning Commission, Public Safety Personnel Retirement System Board, Transportation Advisory Committee and the Youth Council. Selection to these groups is by City Council action.\n\nThe City is organized into nine departments: the City Manager's Office, the City Clerk's Office, Community Services, Development Services, Economic Development, Finance, Fire, Human Services and the Police Department. More than 250 individuals work for the municipality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Civic and nonprofit organizations==\n*F.O.R.
