It is the shortest common [[middle-distance running]] event. The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track (400-metre track) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896. During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track, therefore requiring four laps.\n\nThe event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile (880 yards), a traditional English racing distance.  Imperial racing distances were common in the United States.   American high schools (in the name of the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]]) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980, following the [[NCAA]]'s conversion in 1976.  Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the [[Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1966 Commonwealth Games]].  800&nbsp;m is 4.67&nbsp;m less than half a [[mile]].\n\nThe event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed. Both the aerobic and [[anaerobic system]]s are being taxed to a high extent, thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems.\n\nRunners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the [[400 metres]] or the [[4 \u00d7 400 metres relay]]<ref>While 1500m runners are usually encouraged to run [[5000 metres]] and/or 3000m steeplechase.</ref> but only [[Alberto Juantorena]] and [[Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1]] have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined, 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the [[200 metres]] while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the [[1500 metres]] or long distance events.\n\n==Training==\n800m runners have training plans that include both speed and endurance work, in order to improve both the [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] energy systems, as both of these are used in the race. Almost all 800m athletes' training will be on the track during the outdoor season (Summer), and will mostly consist of repetitions of distances between 200m and 1000m. Coaches have varying opinions on training during Winter; some argue the athlete should continue to do 800m training and racing on indoor tracks, whereas others argue that [[Cross country running|cross-country]] running is more beneficial as it develops strength and endurance. 800-metre runners tend to include at least one longer run per week in their training schedule, but this may be more depending on their standard. For junior athletes these may be 2\u20134 miles (3\u20136&nbsp;km), however for senior athletes these may be 5\u20137 miles (8\u201311&nbsp;km). [[Sebastian Coe]] ran around 60-70 (95\u2013110&nbsp;km) miles per week at his peak, whereas [[Steve Ovett]] ran 100\u2013120 miles (160\u2013190&nbsp;km). It is worth noting that the training of these two athletes was aimed at the [[1500 metres|1500m]] and [[Mile run|mile]] as well as the 800m. The higher an athlete's standard, the more likely they are to do \"strength and conditioning\" training, which may include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], or [[plyometrics]].\n\n==Race tactics==\nThe 800 m event is also known for its tactical racing techniques. Because the 800 m event is the shortest middle distance event that has all the runners converge on lane one, positioning on the cut-in and the position of the pack is critical to the outcome of the race. It is commonly believed that getting the first or second position early in the race is advantageous as these positions are not usually caught up in the pack. Olympic champions [[Dave Wottle]], [[Yuriy Borzakovskiy]] and others have defied that logic by running a more evenly paced race, lagging behind the pack and kicking past the slowing early leaders. Often the winner of 800 m races at high levels are not determined by the strongest runner but instead by the athlete with the best positioning near the end of the race. This leads to a high probability of an upset. Competitive races tend to put the athletes in different lanes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://az.milesplit.com/articles/143353/a-fans-guide-to-the-800m|title=A Fan's Guide to the 800m|last=Versaw|first=Rob|work=Arizona Milesplit|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}</ref> Sometimes the race will begin on a \"waterfall\" start, making the starting line much more crowded and making it difficult to have a good start. This is common in youth running, but unlikely anywhere else.\n\nTwo common tactics for the 800 metres are running a [[negative split]] or a positive split between laps. The positive split is widely considered to be the more effective strategy, but on occasion experienced runners have been known to use a negative split to their advantage. A positive split is achieved by running the first lap faster than the second lap, and a negative split is achieved by the opposite, running the second lap faster than the first. The current world record holder, [[David Rudisha]], runs using a positive split strategy.  In his 2012 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] race, he ran his first lap in 49.28 seconds and his second lap in 51.63 seconds.

metres''', or '''800 meters''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re.2C -er|US spelling]]), is a common [[track running]] event. It is the shortest common [[middle-distance running]] event. The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track (400-metre track) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896. During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track, therefore requiring four laps.\n\nThe event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile (880 yards), a traditional English racing distance.  Imperial racing distances were common in the United States.   American high schools (in the name of the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]]) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980, following the [[NCAA]]'s conversion in 1976.  Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the [[Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1966 Commonwealth Games]].  800&nbsp;m is 4.67&nbsp;m less than half a [[mile]].\n\nThe event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed. Both the aerobic and [[anaerobic system]]s are being taxed to a high extent, thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems.\n\nRunners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the [[400 metres]] or the [[4 \u00d7 400 metres relay]]<ref>While 1500m runners are usually encouraged to run [[5000 metres]] and/or 3000m steeplechase.</ref> but only [[Alberto Juantorena]] and [[Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1]] have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined, 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the [[200 metres]] while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the [[1500 metres]] or long distance events.\n\n==Training==\n800m runners have training plans that include both speed and endurance work, in order to improve both the [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] energy systems, as both of these are used in the race. Almost all 800m athletes' training will be on the track during the outdoor season (Summer), and will mostly consist of repetitions of distances between 200m and 1000m. Coaches have varying opinions on training during Winter; some argue the athlete should continue to do 800m training and racing on indoor tracks, whereas others argue that [[Cross country running|cross-country]] running is more beneficial as it develops strength and endurance. 800-metre runners tend to include at least one longer run per week in their training schedule, but this may be more depending on their standard. For junior athletes these may be 2\u20134 miles (3\u20136&nbsp;km), however for senior athletes these may be 5\u20137 miles (8\u201311&nbsp;km). [[Sebastian Coe]] ran around 60-70 (95\u2013110&nbsp;km) miles per week at his peak, whereas [[Steve Ovett]] ran 100\u2013120 miles (160\u2013190&nbsp;km). It is worth noting that the training of these two athletes was aimed at the [[1500 metres|1500m]] and [[Mile run|mile]] as well as the 800m. The higher an athlete's standard, the more likely they are to do \"strength and conditioning\" training, which may include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], or [[plyometrics]].\n\n==Race tactics==\nThe 800 m event is also known for its tactical racing techniques. Because the 800 m event is the shortest middle distance event that has all the runners converge on lane one, positioning on the cut-in and the position of the pack is critical to the outcome of the race. It is commonly believed that getting the first or second position early in the race is advantageous as these positions are not usually caught up in the pack. Olympic champions [[Dave Wottle]], [[Yuriy Borzakovskiy]] and others have defied that logic by running a more evenly paced race, lagging behind the pack and kicking past the slowing early leaders. Often the winner of 800 m races at high levels are not determined by the strongest runner but instead by the athlete with the best positioning near the end of the race. This leads to a high probability of an upset. Competitive races tend to put the athletes in different lanes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://az.milesplit.com/articles/143353/a-fans-guide-to-the-800m|title=A Fan's Guide to the 800m|last=Versaw|first=Rob|work=Arizona Milesplit|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}</ref> Sometimes the race will begin on a \"waterfall\" start, making the starting line much more crowded and making it difficult to have a good start. This is common in youth running, but unlikely anywhere else.\n\nTwo common tactics for the 800 metres are running a [[negative split]] or a positive split between laps. The positive split is widely considered to be the more effective strategy, but on occasion experienced runners have been known to use a negative split to their advantage. A positive split is achieved by running the first lap faster than the second lap, and a negative split is achieved by the opposite, running the second lap faster than the first. The current world record holder, [[David Rudisha]], runs using a positive split strategy.  In his 2012 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] race, he ran his first lap in 49.28 seconds and his second lap in 51.63 seconds. Theoretically, an even split is the most effective strategy, but it is nearly impossible to achieve due to the race's length.\n\n==Continental records==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Area\n!colspan=3| Men\n!colspan=3| Women\n|-\n!

Given that in [[biology]] many [[scientific classification|phyla]], families and [[genera]] have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] rather than on [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].\n\nA large proportion of all [[life|life on Earth]] lives in the ocean. The exact size of this ''large proportion'' is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered.

The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in [[surface tension]] between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the [[oceanic trench]]es, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. Specific habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], the surrounds of [[seamount]]s and [[thermal vent]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) {{convert|25-32|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length. [[Marine ecosystem|Marine ecology]] is the study of how marine organisms interact with each other and the environment.\n\nMarine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support [[recreation]] and [[tourism]] all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].<ref name=\"DMS\">{{cite journal | title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response| last1=Foley| first1=Jonathan A.| last2=Taylor| first2=Karl E.| last3=Ghan| first3=Steven J.| doi=10.1007/BF00142502| journal=Climatic Change| volume=18| issue=1| year=1991| pages=1| bibcode=1991ClCh...18....1F}}</ref> [[Shore]]lines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.<ref name=\"Sousa\">{{cite book| last=Sousa| first=Wayne P.| editor1-last=Pickett| editor1-first=Steward T.

It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean).

During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world. Many voyages contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge. Among the most significant were the voyages of {{HMS|Beagle}} where [[Charles Darwin]] came up with his theories of [[evolution]] and on the formation of [[coral reefs]].<ref>Ward, Ritchie R.

Tyler. Deep-sea biology: a natural history of organisms at the deep-sea floor. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991: 1</ref> This era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies because they lacked technology that would allow them to adequately examine species that lived in deep parts of the oceans.\n\nThe creation of marine laboratories was important because it allowed marine biologists to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. The oldest marine laboratory in the world, [[Station biologique de Roscoff]], was established in France in 1872. In the United States, the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] dates back to 1903, while the prominent [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] was founded in 1930.<ref>Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888-1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole.

Microbes are responsible for virtually all the [[photosynthesis]] that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and other [[nutrients]] and trace elements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151210181647.htm |title=Functions of global ocean microbiome key to understanding environmental changes |date=December 10, 2015 |website=www.sciencedaily.com |publisher=University of Georgia |access-date=December 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMicroscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood. For example, the role of [[virus]]es in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suttle\n|first=C.A.|title=Viruses in the Sea|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=437|issue=9|pages=356\u2013361|doi=10.1038/nature04160|pmid=16163346|bibcode=2005Natur.437..356S}}</ref>\n\nThe role of [[phytoplankton]] is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous [[primary production|primary producers]] on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of [[algae]] (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[Euglenid|euglenoids]], [[coccolithophorid]]s, [[cryptomonad]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[chlorophyte]]s, [[prasinophyte]]s, and [[silicoflagellate]]s.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many [[Protozoa]] are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates, [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[radiolarian]]s. Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[chaetognatha|chaetognaths]], [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[Tunicate|urochordates]], and [[annelid]]s such as [[polychaete]]s. Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms. Two examples are [[fish larva]]e and sea stars (also called [[starfish]]).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Plants and algae ===\n{{main article|Marine algae and plants}}\n\nMicroscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding places for larval forms of larger fish and foraging places for invertebrates.\n\nAlgal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the [[ecological niche|niche]] occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic [[algae]] in the ocean, such as ''[[Sargassum]]'' and [[kelp]], which are commonly known as [[seaweed]]s that create [[kelp forest]]s.\n\nPlants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the [[seagrass]]es (examples of which are eelgrass, ''[[Zostera]]'', and turtle grass, ''Thalassia''). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The [[foreshore|intertidal zone]] is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where [[mangroves]] or [[cordgrass]] or [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|beach grass]] might grow. \n{{clear}}\n\n===Invertebrates===\n[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Crown-of-thorns starfish]]}}]]\n{{Main|Marine invertebrates}}\n\nAs on land, [[invertebrates]] make up a huge portion of all life in the sea. Invertebrate sea life includes [[Cnidaria]] such as [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemone]]s; [[Ctenophora (phylum)|Ctenophora]]; [[sea worm]]s including the [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nemertea]], [[Annelida]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Echiura]], [[Chaetognatha]], and [[Phoronida]]; [[Mollusca]] including [[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]; [[Arthropoda]] including [[Chelicerata]] and [[Crustacea]]; [[Porifera]]; [[Bryozoa]]; [[Echinodermata]] including starfish; and [[Urochordata]] including [[sea squirt]]s or [[tunicate]]s. Invertebrates have no backbone. There are over a million species.\n\n=== Fungi ===\n{{main|Marine fungi}}\n[[File:Grilse001.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Mature salmon with fungal disease]]\n\nOver 1500 species of [[fungi]] are known from marine environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=K.D. |author2=E.B.J.

Most [[extant taxon|extant]] marine reptiles, except for some sea snakes, are [[oviparity|oviparous]] and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Thus most species, excepting sea turtles, spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Despite their marine adaptations, most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries.<ref name=\"Sti74\">Stidworthy J. 1974.

(Tube sponge).jpg|caption=[[Coral reef]]s provide marine habitats for tube sponges, which in turn become marine habitats for fish}}\n{{main|Marine habitats}}\n\nMarine habitats can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the [[shoreline]] to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean and affected by [[ocean current]]s, while demersal habitats are near or on the bottom. Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and sea grasses, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.\n\n===Intertidal and near shore===\n[[File:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools with sea stars and [[sea anemone]]]]\n\n[[Intertidal zone]]s, the areas that are close to the shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life can be found within this zone. Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].{{clear left}}\n\n===Estuaries===\n[[File:Urdaibai, Bizkaia, Euskal Herria.jpg|thumb|left|Estuaries have shifting flows of sea water and fresh water.]]\n\n[[Estuaries]] are also near shore and influenced by the [[tides]]. An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea.<ref name=\"james\">{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D.

They are subject both to marine influences\u2014such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water\u2014and to riverine influences\u2014such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The shifting flows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.<ref name=\"McLusky\">{{cite book |last=McLusky |first=D.

The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.\n\nMuch attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.<ref>NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year.

At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists.

Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[biome]]s and many new [[microbe]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations .{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== Subfields ==\nThe [[marine ecosystem]] is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as [[phycology]], [[invertebrate zoology]] and [[ichthyology]]. Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in [[sea water]] and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as [[carbon dioxide]] displacement). Recent marine [[biotechnology]] has focused largely on marine [[biomolecule]]s, especially [[protein]]s, that may have uses in medicine or engineering. Marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire [[Bionics|biomimetic material]]s.\n\n===Marine biodiversity===\n\n{{empty section|date=April 2019}}\n=== Related fields ===\nMarine biology is a branch of [[biology]]. It is closely linked to [[oceanography]] and may be regarded as a sub-field of [[marine science]]. It also encompasses many ideas from [[ecology]]. [[Fisheries science]] and [[marine conservation]] can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as [[environmental studies]]). Marine Chemistry, Physical oceanography and Atmospheric sciences are closely related to this field.\n\n==Distribution factors==\nAn active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s of various species and where they spend their time. Technologies that aid in this discovery include [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s, [[acoustic tag]]s, and a variety of other [[data loggers]]. Marine biologists study how the [[ocean current]]s, [[tide]]s and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms, including their growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and newer underwater visual devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nMost ocean life breeds in specific places, nests or not in others, spends time as juveniles in still others, and in maturity in yet others. Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts of their life cycles especially in the infant and juvenile years.

Specific habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], the surrounds of [[seamount]]s and [[thermal vent]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary.

[[Marine ecosystem|Marine ecology]] is the study of how marine organisms interact with each other and the environment.\n\nMarine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support [[recreation]] and [[tourism]] all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet.

The oldest marine laboratory in the world, [[Station biologique de Roscoff]], was established in France in 1872. In the United States, the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] dates back to 1903, while the prominent [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] was founded in 1930.<ref>Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888-1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole.

Phytoplankton are categorized into [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of [[algae]] (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[Euglenid|euglenoids]], [[coccolithophorid]]s, [[cryptomonad]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[chlorophyte]]s, [[prasinophyte]]s, and [[silicoflagellate]]s.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many [[Protozoa]] are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates, [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[radiolarian]]s. Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[chaetognatha|chaetognaths]], [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[Tunicate|urochordates]], and [[annelid]]s such as [[polychaete]]s. Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms. Two examples are [[fish larva]]e and sea stars (also called [[starfish]]).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Plants and algae ===\n{{main article|Marine algae and plants}}\n\nMicroscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding places for larval forms of larger fish and foraging places for invertebrates.\n\nAlgal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the [[ecological niche|niche]] occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic [[algae]] in the ocean, such as ''[[Sargassum]]'' and [[kelp]], which are commonly known as [[seaweed]]s that create [[kelp forest]]s.\n\nPlants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the [[seagrass]]es (examples of which are eelgrass, ''[[Zostera]]'', and turtle grass, ''Thalassia''). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The [[foreshore|intertidal zone]] is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where [[mangroves]] or [[cordgrass]] or [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|beach grass]] might grow. \n{{clear}}\n\n===Invertebrates===\n[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Crown-of-thorns starfish]]}}]]\n{{Main|Marine invertebrates}}\n\nAs on land, [[invertebrates]] make up a huge portion of all life in the sea. Invertebrate sea life includes [[Cnidaria]] such as [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemone]]s; [[Ctenophora (phylum)|Ctenophora]]; [[sea worm]]s including the [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nemertea]], [[Annelida]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Echiura]], [[Chaetognatha]], and [[Phoronida]]; [[Mollusca]] including [[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]; [[Arthropoda]] including [[Chelicerata]] and [[Crustacea]]; [[Porifera]]; [[Bryozoa]]; [[Echinodermata]] including starfish; and [[Urochordata]] including [[sea squirt]]s or [[tunicate]]s.

Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the [[shoreline]] to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean and affected by [[ocean current]]s, while demersal habitats are near or on the bottom. Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and sea grasses, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.\n\n===Intertidal and near shore===\n[[File:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools with sea stars and [[sea anemone]]]]\n\n[[Intertidal zone]]s, the areas that are close to the shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life can be found within this zone. Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].{{clear left}}\n\n===Estuaries===\n[[File:Urdaibai, Bizkaia, Euskal Herria.jpg|thumb|left|Estuaries have shifting flows of sea water and fresh water.]]\n\n[[Estuaries]] are also near shore and influenced by the [[tides]].

The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.\n\nMuch attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] weather phenomenon.

Much of the aphotic zone's energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]].{{clear left}}\n\n=== Deep sea and trenches ===\n[[File:Deep sea chimaera.jpg|thumb|A deep-sea chimaera.

At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.<ref>[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.</ref> In general, the deep sea is considered to start at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/geology-and-oceanography/geology-and-oceanography/aphotic-zone|title=Aphotic Zone {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as [[bio-luminescence]]. Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[biome]]s and many new [[microbe]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations .{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== Subfields ==\nThe [[marine ecosystem]] is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as [[phycology]], [[invertebrate zoology]] and [[ichthyology]]. Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in [[sea water]] and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as [[carbon dioxide]] displacement). Recent marine [[biotechnology]] has focused largely on marine [[biomolecule]]s, especially [[protein]]s, that may have uses in medicine or engineering. Marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire [[Bionics|biomimetic material]]s.\n\n===Marine biodiversity===\n\n{{empty section|date=April 2019}}\n=== Related fields ===\nMarine biology is a branch of [[biology]]. It is closely linked to [[oceanography]] and may be regarded as a sub-field of [[marine science]]. It also encompasses many ideas from [[ecology]]. [[Fisheries science]] and [[marine conservation]] can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as [[environmental studies]]). Marine Chemistry, Physical oceanography and Atmospheric sciences are closely related to this field.\n\n==Distribution factors==\nAn active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s of various species and where they spend their time. Technologies that aid in this discovery include [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s, [[acoustic tag]]s, and a variety of other [[data loggers]]. Marine biologists study how the [[ocean current]]s, [[tide]]s and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms, including their growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and newer underwater visual devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nMost ocean life breeds in specific places, nests or not in others, spends time as juveniles in still others, and in maturity in yet others. Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts of their life cycles especially in the infant and juvenile years. For example, it is still largely unknown where juvenile [[sea turtle]]s and some year-1 [[shark]]s travel. Recent advances in underwater tracking devices are illuminating what we know about marine organisms that live at great Ocean depths.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=82eb97f4b587306a3537ecf16&id=e398851e6b&e=%5BUNIQID%5D | title=March 2014 Newsletter - What's Going on at Desert Star}}</ref> The information that [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s give aids in certain time of the year fishing closures and development of a [[marine protected area]]. This data is important to both scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that by restricting commercial fishing in one small area they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Marine life|Water|Underwater diving}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Acoustic ecology]]\n* [[Aquaculture]]\n* [[Bathymetry]]\n* [[Freshwater biology]]\n* [[Modular ocean model]]\n* [[Oceanic basin]]\n* [[Oceanic climate]]\n* [[Phycology]]\n* [[World Ocean Atlas]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Lists ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Glossary of ecology]]\n* [[Index of biology articles]]\n* [[Large marine ecosystem]]\n* [[List of ecologists]]\n* [[List of marine biologists]]\n* [[List of marine ecoregions (WWF)]]\n* [[Outline of biology]]\n* [[Outline of ecology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further references ==\n* Morrissey J and Sumich J (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2cm_s-I01kcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Introduction+to+the+Biology+of+Marine+Life%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xGpWVMDQDuXUmgXO74KACA&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Introduction%20to%20the%20Biology%20of%20Marine%20Life%22&f=false ''Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life''] Jones & Bartlett Publishers. {{ISBN|9780763781606}}.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://ocean.si.edu/ Smithsonian Ocean Portal]\n* [http://www.mcsuk.org/ Marine Conservation Society]\n* {{dmoz|Science/Biology/Ecology/Aquatic_Ecology/Marine}}\n* [http://www.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/maec Marine Ecology - an evolutionary perspective]\n* [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mae.2011.32.issue-s1/issuetoc Free special issue: Marine Biology in Time and Space]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGRJjuMLMgE Creatures of the deep ocean] \u2013 ''National Geographic'' documentary, 2010.\n* [http://www.exploris.org.uk Exploris]\n* [http://content.lib.washington.edu/fishweb/index.html Freshwater and Marine Image Bank] - From the University of Washington Library\n* [http://www.marinetraining.eu Marine Training Portal] - Portal grouping training initiatives in the field of Marine Biology\n\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=marine}}\n{{fishery science topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marine Biology}}\n[[Category:Marine biology| ]]\n[[Category:Biological oceanography]]\n[[Category:Fisheries science]]\n[[Category:Oceanographical terminology]]\n", "name_user": "97.122.191.213", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology"}

The Cavaliers claimed to have reached an understanding with Boozer and his agent on a deal for approximately $39 million over six years, which he would have signed if they let him out of his current deal.\n\nCleveland then proceeded to release him from his contract making him a restricted free agent.

However, he suffered an injury, missing the later part of the season, which contributed to the Jazz missing [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for only the second time in 22 years, and he was publicly criticized for a lack of effort by team owner [[Larry H. Miller|Larry Miller]].\n\nAs the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] began, Boozer was still recovering from injury, and then aggravated a hamstring, causing him to miss the first half of that season as well. He returned to action in late February, easing into action by coming off the bench for the Jazz. In the middle of March, he was placed back into the starting lineup. From that point, he finished the season in impressive fashion, averaging over 20 points and almost 10 rebounds per game and firmly establishing himself as the Jazz's starting power forward once again.\n\nBoozer got off to a strong start in the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], winning the Western Conference Player of the Week Award and helping the Jazz to win eleven of their first twelve games. Boozer was named part of the [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] roster as a reserve, but could not participate because of a hairline fracture in his left [[fibula]].\n\nIn an April 23, 2007 game against the [[Houston Rockets]] (game two of the first round of the 2007 playoffs), Boozer scored 41 points, tying the career high he had set a month earlier on March 26 (vs. the [[Washington Wizards]]). He also led the Jazz past the Rockets in game 7 of the first round in the NBA Playoffs, scoring 35 points, grabbing 14 rebounds and two clutch free throws to secure the victory in Boozer's first playoff series.\n\nThe Jazz would go on to win their second round series against the upstart Golden State Warriors, 4 games to 1, and advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1998. Even though they lost 4 games to 1 to the more experienced San Antonio Spurs, Boozer proved valuable and durable. He ended the season averaging 20.9 points and 11.7 rebounds per game, and playing in 74 of 82 games. He was even better in the playoffs, increasing his output to 23.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game, and appearing in all 17 Jazz playoff games.\n\nIn November 2007, Boozer was named [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Player of the Month.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/news/pom_071203.html |title=Dwight Howard, Boozer Named Players of the Month |access-date=December 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109203514/http://www.nba.com/news/pom_071203.html |archive-date=January 9, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By mid-December, he was among the league's top five performers in [[point (basketball)|scoring]], [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] and [[field goal percentage]].

Determined to not allow him to beat them, the Rockets geared their defense more to stopping Boozer and his production was somewhat limited (16.0 points and 11.7 rebounds per game), but the Jazz defeated the Rockets, 4\u20132. In the second round of the 2008 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the top seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games.\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], Boozer's ability to stay healthy was questioned by fans and media alike, as he missed 44 games following arthroscopic left knee surgery. He missed time from late November 2008 to late February 2009. When he played, his numbers were 16.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, in 37 games (all starts). With his possible pending free agency at the end of the season looming, it seemed likely Boozer would leave. However, when the deadline for choosing free agency or opting into the remaining year came, he surprised many by opting in for the 2009\u201310 season with the Jazz. The Jazz management stated publicly they were happy to have him return and play for them, and Boozer did the same.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 NBA season|2009\u201310]], Boozer played well, averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and shot 56.2% from the field, a career high. He played in 78 of 82 games and avoided injury, which boded well heading into the 2010 summer.\n\n===Chicago Bulls (2010\u20132014)===\n[[File:Carlos Boozer and Andray Blatche.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Boozer posting up [[Andray Blatche]] in a game for the Bulls in 2011.]]\nOn July 8, 2010, Boozer was acquired by the [[Chicago Bulls]] in a [[Sign and trade|sign-and-trade]] deal with the Jazz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6168 |title=Bulls sign Carlos Boozer |work=InsideHoops.com |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113223521/http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6168 |archive-date=November 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nba/news/story?id=5361792 |title=Boozer has Bulls deal |work=ESPN.com |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite missing 23 games due to injury in 2010\u201311, Boozer still managed to average 17.5 points and 9.6 rebounds per game while also helping the Bulls get the first seed in the Eastern Conference.

I think I've made that clear.\"<ref>[http://basketbawful.blogspot.com.au/2008/07/word-of-day-pull-boozer.html Word of the Day: Pull a Boozer]</ref>\n\n===Utah Jazz (2004\u20132010)===\n[[File:Carlos Boozer-2.jpeg|thumb|left|Carlos Boozer shooting a free throw while playing with the [[Utah Jazz]] in March 2008.|300x300px]]\nIn his first season with the Jazz in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]], Boozer averaged 17 points and 9 rebounds per game. However, he suffered an injury, missing the later part of the season, which contributed to the Jazz missing [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for only the second time in 22 years, and he was publicly criticized for a lack of effort by team owner [[Larry H. Miller|Larry Miller]].\n\nAs the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] began, Boozer was still recovering from injury, and then aggravated a hamstring, causing him to miss the first half of that season as well. He returned to action in late February, easing into action by coming off the bench for the Jazz. In the middle of March, he was placed back into the starting lineup. From that point, he finished the season in impressive fashion, averaging over 20 points and almost 10 rebounds per game and firmly establishing himself as the Jazz's starting power forward once again.\n\nBoozer got off to a strong start in the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], winning the Western Conference Player of the Week Award and helping the Jazz to win eleven of their first twelve games. Boozer was named part of the [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] roster as a reserve, but could not participate because of a hairline fracture in his left [[fibula]].\n\nIn an April 23, 2007 game against the [[Houston Rockets]] (game two of the first round of the 2007 playoffs), Boozer scored 41 points, tying the career high he had set a month earlier on March 26 (vs. the [[Washington Wizards]]). He also led the Jazz past the Rockets in game 7 of the first round in the NBA Playoffs, scoring 35 points, grabbing 14 rebounds and two clutch free throws to secure the victory in Boozer's first playoff series.\n\nThe Jazz would go on to win their second round series against the upstart Golden State Warriors, 4 games to 1, and advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1998. Even though they lost 4 games to 1 to the more experienced San Antonio Spurs, Boozer proved valuable and durable. He ended the season averaging 20.9 points and 11.7 rebounds per game, and playing in 74 of 82 games. He was even better in the playoffs, increasing his output to 23.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game, and appearing in all 17 Jazz playoff games.\n\nIn November 2007, Boozer was named [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Player of the Month.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/news/pom_071203.html |title=Dwight Howard, Boozer Named Players of the Month |access-date=December 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109203514/http://www.nba.com/news/pom_071203.html |archive-date=January 9, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By mid-December, he was among the league's top five performers in [[point (basketball)|scoring]], [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] and [[field goal percentage]]. Although he later slipped in all of these categories, he continued to produce solid numbers. Boozer was again chosen as a backup in the All-Star Game, finishing with 14 points and 10 rebounds in just 19 minutes of play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280217032 |title=Allen's flurry of 3s help East hold on for All-Star win |work=ESPN.com |date=February 17, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> He registered his first career [[triple-double]] against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] on February 13, 2008, with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280213025 |title=Boozer's first career triple-double highlights Utah's blowout of Sonics |work=ESPN.com |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2008 playoffs, the Jazz faced the Houston Rockets in the first round for the second year in a row. Determined to not allow him to beat them, the Rockets geared their defense more to stopping Boozer and his production was somewhat limited (16.0 points and 11.7 rebounds per game), but the Jazz defeated the Rockets, 4\u20132. In the second round of the 2008 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the top seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games.\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], Boozer's ability to stay healthy was questioned by fans and media alike, as he missed 44 games following arthroscopic left knee surgery. He missed time from late November 2008 to late February 2009. When he played, his numbers were 16.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, in 37 games (all starts). With his possible pending free agency at the end of the season looming, it seemed likely Boozer would leave. However, when the deadline for choosing free agency or opting into the remaining year came, he surprised many by opting in for the 2009\u201310 season with the Jazz. The Jazz management stated publicly they were happy to have him return and play for them, and Boozer did the same.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 NBA season|2009\u201310]], Boozer played well, averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and shot 56.2% from the field, a career high. He played in 78 of 82 games and avoided injury, which boded well heading into the 2010 summer.\n\n===Chicago Bulls (2010\u20132014)===\n[[File:Carlos Boozer and Andray Blatche.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Boozer posting up [[Andray Blatche]] in a game for the Bulls in 2011.]]\nOn July 8, 2010, Boozer was acquired by the [[Chicago Bulls]] in a [[Sign and trade|sign-and-trade]] deal with the Jazz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6168 |title=Bulls sign Carlos Boozer |work=InsideHoops.com |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113223521/http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6168 |archive-date=November 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nba/news/story?id=5361792 |title=Boozer has Bulls deal |work=ESPN.com |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite missing 23 games due to injury in 2010\u201311, Boozer still managed to average 17.5 points and 9.6 rebounds per game while also helping the Bulls get the first seed in the Eastern Conference.

The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] as '''HMS ''Hercules''''' for the British [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], but construction was put on hold when the war ended. India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961. ''Vikrant'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] as the first [[aircraft carrier]] of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the [[naval blockade]] of [[East Pakistan]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].\n\nIn its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in January 1997. She was preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Cuffe Parade]], [[Mumbai]] until 2012. In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction and [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] in November 2014 after final clearance from the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]].\n\n==History and construction==\n\n{{See also|1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier}}\nIn 1943 the [[Royal Navy]] commissioned six [[light aircraft carrier]]s in an effort to counter the [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies.<ref name=\"faaa-hercules\"/> The [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]], commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized [[fleet aircraft carrier]]s and the less expensive but limited-capability [[escort carrier]]s.{{Sfn|Konstam|2012|p=46}}\n\nSixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were [[keel laying|laid down]] as what became the ''Colossus'' class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the ''Majestic'' class.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|pp=199\u2013200}} The improvements from the ''Colossus'' class to the ''Majestic'' class included heavier displacement, armament, [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]], [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] and aircraft capacity.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=185}} Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of [[World War II]], as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.\nInstead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several [[Commonwealth nations]]. The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=199}}\n\nHMS ''Hercules'', the fifth ship in the ''Majestic'' class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] on the [[River Tyne]].

Captain Pritam Singh Mahindroo was the first commanding officer of the ship, which carried British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and French Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant [[Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani]], who later served as admiral and [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff of India]] from 1984 to 1987. ''Vikrant'' formally joined the Indian Navy's fleet in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) on 3 November 1961, when she was received at [[Ballard Pier]] by then [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"INS Vikrant - Bharat Rakshak\"/>\n\nIn December of that year, the ship was deployed for [[Annexation of Goa|Operation Vijay]] (the code name for the annexation of Goa) off the coast of Goa with two [[destroyer]]s, {{INS|Rajput|D141|6}} and {{INS|Kirpan|1959|6}}.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=203}} ''Vikrant'' did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference.<ref name=\"Operation Vijay: The Liberation of 'Estado da India'- Goa, Daman and Diu\">{{cite web|author1=Brigadier A.

As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}} On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}}\n\nThe ship began preliminary [[sea trial]]s on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26\u201327 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of {{convert|400|psi|lk=on}} and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ship's speed to {{convert|14|kn}}. With the growing expectations of a [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|war with Pakistan]] in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of ''Vikrant'' in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain [[Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani]] told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral [[S. M. Nanda|Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda]]:\n\n{{quote\n|text=...during the 1965 war ''Vikrant'' was sitting in Bombay Harbour and did not go out to sea. If the same thing happened in 1971, ''Vikrant'' would be called a white elephant and naval aviation would be written off.

There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three {{sclass-|Daphne|submarine|1}}s acquired by the [[Pakistan Navy]] posed a significant risk to the carrier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational.{{efn|The A1 boiler was completely blanked off due to serious problems.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}}}} Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and ''Vikrant'' was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 [[Knot (unit)|knots]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=120}}\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1971===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1971}}\n[[File:Indian Navy Sea Hawk aircraft during 1971 Indo-Pakistani war.jpg|thumb|''Vikrant''{{'}}s Sea Hawk squadron ashore during the December 1971 Indo-Pakistan war]]\nAs a part of preparations for the war, ''Vikrant'' was assigned to the [[Eastern Naval Command]], then to the Eastern Fleet. This fleet consisted of INS ''Vikrant'', the two {{sclass-|Leopard|frigate}}s {{INS|Brahmaputra|1957|6}} and {{INS|Beas|1958|6}}, the two [[Arnala-class corvette|Petya III-class]] [[corvette]]s {{INS|Kamorta|P77|6}} and {{INS|Kavaratti|P80|6}}, and one submarine, {{INS|Khanderi|1968|6}}. The main reason behind strengthening the Eastern Fleet was to counter the Pakistani maritime forces deployed in support of military operations in [[East Bengal]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=120}} A surveillance area of {{convert|18,000|sqmi}}, confined by a triangle with a base of {{convert|270|mi|abbr=on}} and sides of {{convert|165|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|mi|abbr=on}}, was set up in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Any ship in this area was to be challenged and checked. If found to be neutral, it would be escorted to the nearest Indian port, otherwise, it would be captured, and taken as a [[war prize]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nIn the meantime, intelligence reports confirmed that Pakistan was to deploy a US-built {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|2}}, {{ship|PNS|Ghazi}}. ''Ghazi'' was considered as a serious threat to ''Vikrant'' by the Indian Navy, as ''Vikrant''{{'}}s approximate position would be known by the Pakistanis once she started operating aircraft. Of the four available surface ships, INS ''Kavaratti'' had no [[sonar]], which meant that the other three had to remain in close vicinity {{convert|5|\u2013|10|mi|abbr=on}} of ''Vikrant'', without which the carrier would be completely vulnerable to attack by ''Ghazi''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nOn 23 July, ''Vikrant'' sailed off to [[Cochin]] in company with the Western Fleet. En route, before reaching Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After the completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for [[Madras]], escorted by ''Brahmaputra'' and ''Beas''. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an [[Br\u00e9guet 1050 Aliz\u00e9|Aliz\u00e9]] without compromising the speed restrictions.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=122}} The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Aliz\u00e9 aircraft would have to land at close to [[Stall (aviation)|stalling]] speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) launches an Alize aircraft during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.jpg|thumb|A Br\u00e9guet 1050 Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft taking off from INS ''Vikrant''|left]]\n\nBy the end of September, ''Vikrant'' and her escorts reached [[Port Blair]]. En route to [[Visakhapatnam]], tactical exercises were conducted in the presence of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, ''Vikrant'' set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26\u201327 October at Vishakhapatnam. ''Vikrant'' then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail ''Vikrant'' to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that ''Vikrant'' was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn 23 November, an emergency was declared in Pakistan after a clash of Indian and Pakistani troops in [[East Pakistan]] two days earlier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}} On 2 December, the Eastern Fleet proceeded to its patrol area in anticipation of an attack by Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had deployed ''Ghazi'' on 14 November with the explicit goal of targeting and sinking ''Vikrant'', and ''Ghazi'' reached a location near Madras by the 23rd.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}}{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} In an attempt to deceive the Pakistan Navy and ''Ghazi'', India's Naval Headquarters deployed ''Rajput'' as a decoy\u2014the ship sailed {{convert|160|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Vishakhapatnam and broadcast a significant amount of radio traffic, making her appear to be ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=142}}\n\n''Ghazi'', meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} On the night of 3\u20134 December, a muffled underwater explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a [[clearance diver|clearance diving team]] was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that ''Ghazi'' had sunk in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\nThe reason for ''Ghazi''{{'}}s fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's official historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed the position of the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that ''Ghazi'' had come up to [[Periscope#Naval use|periscope depth]] to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to [[crash dive]], which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: on the night of the explosion, ''Rajput'' was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two [[depth charge]]s on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}} The third possibility is that there was a mishap when ''Ghazi'' was laying [[Naval mine|mines]] on the day before hostilities broke out.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\n''Vikrant'' was redeployed towards [[Chittagong]] at the outbreak of hostilities. On 4 December, the ship's Sea Hawks struck shipping in Chittagong and [[Cox's Bazar]] harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of the ships present. Later strikes targeted [[Khulna]] and the [[Port of Mongla]], which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan.{{Sfn|Roy|1995|p=165}} On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the [[cantonment]] area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Aliz\u00e9s continued on Cox's Bazar. After this, ''Vikrant''{{'}}s fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to [[Paradip]] for refueling.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=139}} The crew of INS ''Vikrant'' earned two [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s and twelve [[Vir Chakra]] gallantry medals for their part in the war.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}}\n\n===Later years===\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.jpg|thumb|A Sea King helicopter with INS ''Vikrant'']]\n''Vikrant'' did not see much service after the war, and was given two major modernisation [[refit]]s\u2014the first one from 1979 to 1981 and the second one from 1987 to 1989.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2009|p=151}} In the first phase, her boilers, radars, communication systems  and anti-aircraft guns were modernised, and facilities to operate Sea Harriers were installed.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=276}} In the second phase, facilities to operate the new Sea Harrier Vertical/Short Take Off and Land (V/STOL) fighter aircraft and the new Sea King Mk 42B Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters were introduced.

Navy]]. The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] as '''HMS ''Hercules''''' for the British [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], but construction was put on hold when the war ended. India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961. ''Vikrant'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] as the first [[aircraft carrier]] of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the [[naval blockade]] of [[East Pakistan]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].\n\nIn its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in January 1997. She was preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Cuffe Parade]], [[Mumbai]] until 2012. In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction and [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] in November 2014 after final clearance from the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]].\n\n==History and construction==\n\n{{See also|1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier}}\nIn 1943 the [[Royal Navy]] commissioned six [[light aircraft carrier]]s in an effort to counter the [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies.<ref name=\"faaa-hercules\"/> The [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]], commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized [[fleet aircraft carrier]]s and the less expensive but limited-capability [[escort carrier]]s.{{Sfn|Konstam|2012|p=46}}\n\nSixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were [[keel laying|laid down]] as what became the ''Colossus'' class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the ''Majestic'' class.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|pp=199\u2013200}} The improvements from the ''Colossus'' class to the ''Majestic'' class included heavier displacement, armament, [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]], [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] and aircraft capacity.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=185}} Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of [[World War II]], as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.\nInstead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several [[Commonwealth nations]]. The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=199}}\n\nHMS ''Hercules'', the fifth ship in the ''Majestic'' class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] on the [[River Tyne]]. After World War II ended with [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan's surrender]] on 2 September 1945, she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946.<ref name=faaa-hercules>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/ships/Hercules.html|title=HMS Hercules|publisher=Fleet Air Arm Archive|access-date=13 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131203708/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/ships/Hercules.html|archivedate=31 January 2012}}</ref> At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete.<ref name=\"INS Vikrant - Bharat Rakshak\"/> Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in [[Gare Loch|Gareloch]] [[Firth of Clyde|off the Clyde]]. In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to [[Belfast]] to complete her construction and modifications by [[Harland and Wolff]]. Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an angled deck, [[steam catapult]]s, and a modified [[Aircraft carrier#Structure|island]].{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=203}}\n\n==Design and description==\n\n''Vikrant'' displaced {{convert|16,000|t|LT|-1|abbr=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|19,500|t|LT|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].

She was powered by a pair of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine|geared steam turbine]]s, driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by four [[Three-drum boiler#Admiralty boiler|Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|40,000|ihp|lk=in}} which gave a maximum speed of {{convert|25|kn|lk=in}}. ''Vikrant'' carried about {{convert|3175|t|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel oil that gave her a range of {{convert|12000|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|14|kn}}, and {{convert|6200|mi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|23|kn}}.

Captain Pritam Singh Mahindroo was the first commanding officer of the ship, which carried British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and French Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant [[Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani]], who later served as admiral and [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff of India]] from 1984 to 1987. ''Vikrant'' formally joined the Indian Navy's fleet in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) on 3 November 1961, when she was received at [[Ballard Pier]] by then [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"INS Vikrant - Bharat Rakshak\"/>\n\nIn December of that year, the ship was deployed for [[Annexation of Goa|Operation Vijay]] (the code name for the annexation of Goa) off the coast of Goa with two [[destroyer]]s, {{INS|Rajput|D141|6}} and {{INS|Kirpan|1959|6}}.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=203}} ''Vikrant'' did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference.<ref name=\"Operation Vijay: The Liberation of 'Estado da India'- Goa, Daman and Diu\">{{cite web|author1=Brigadier A.

As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}} On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}}\n\nThe ship began preliminary [[sea trial]]s on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26\u201327 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of {{convert|400|psi|lk=on}} and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ship's speed to {{convert|14|kn}}. With the growing expectations of a [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|war with Pakistan]] in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of ''Vikrant'' in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain [[Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani]] told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral [[S. M. Nanda|Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda]]:\n\n{{quote\n|text=...during the 1965 war ''Vikrant'' was sitting in Bombay Harbour and did not go out to sea. If the same thing happened in 1971, ''Vikrant'' would be called a white elephant and naval aviation would be written off.

There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three {{sclass-|Daphne|submarine|1}}s acquired by the [[Pakistan Navy]] posed a significant risk to the carrier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational.{{efn|The A1 boiler was completely blanked off due to serious problems.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}}}} Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and ''Vikrant'' was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 [[Knot (unit)|knots]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=120}}\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1971===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1971}}\n[[File:Indian Navy Sea Hawk aircraft during 1971 Indo-Pakistani war.jpg|thumb|''Vikrant''{{'}}s Sea Hawk squadron ashore during the December 1971 Indo-Pakistan war]]\nAs a part of preparations for the war, ''Vikrant'' was assigned to the [[Eastern Naval Command]], then to the Eastern Fleet. This fleet consisted of INS ''Vikrant'', the two {{sclass-|Leopard|frigate}}s {{INS|Brahmaputra|1957|6}} and {{INS|Beas|1958|6}}, the two [[Arnala-class corvette|Petya III-class]] [[corvette]]s {{INS|Kamorta|P77|6}} and {{INS|Kavaratti|P80|6}}, and one submarine, {{INS|Khanderi|S22|6}}. The main reason behind strengthening the Eastern Fleet was to counter the Pakistani maritime forces deployed in support of military operations in [[East Bengal]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=120}} A surveillance area of {{convert|18,000|sqmi}}, confined by a triangle with a base of {{convert|270|mi|abbr=on}} and sides of {{convert|165|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|mi|abbr=on}}, was set up in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Any ship in this area was to be challenged and checked. If found to be neutral, it would be escorted to the nearest Indian port, otherwise, it would be captured, and taken as a [[war prize]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nIn the meantime, intelligence reports confirmed that Pakistan was to deploy a US-built {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|2}}, {{ship|PNS|Ghazi}}. ''Ghazi'' was considered as a serious threat to ''Vikrant'' by the Indian Navy, as ''Vikrant''{{'}}s approximate position would be known by the Pakistanis once she started operating aircraft. Of the four available surface ships, INS ''Kavaratti'' had no [[sonar]], which meant that the other three had to remain in close vicinity {{convert|5|\u2013|10|mi|abbr=on}} of ''Vikrant'', without which the carrier would be completely vulnerable to attack by ''Ghazi''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nOn 23 July, ''Vikrant'' sailed off to [[Cochin]] in company with the Western Fleet. En route, before reaching Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After the completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for [[Madras]], escorted by ''Brahmaputra'' and ''Beas''. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an [[Br\u00e9guet 1050 Aliz\u00e9|Aliz\u00e9]] without compromising the speed restrictions.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=122}} The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Aliz\u00e9 aircraft would have to land at close to [[Stall (aviation)|stalling]] speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) launches an Alize aircraft during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.jpg|thumb|A Br\u00e9guet 1050 Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft taking off from INS ''Vikrant''|left]]\n\nBy the end of September, ''Vikrant'' and her escorts reached [[Port Blair]]. En route to [[Visakhapatnam]], tactical exercises were conducted in the presence of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, ''Vikrant'' set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26\u201327 October at Vishakhapatnam. ''Vikrant'' then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail ''Vikrant'' to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that ''Vikrant'' was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn 23 November, an emergency was declared in Pakistan after a clash of Indian and Pakistani troops in [[East Pakistan]] two days earlier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}} On 2 December, the Eastern Fleet proceeded to its patrol area in anticipation of an attack by Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had deployed ''Ghazi'' on 14 November with the explicit goal of targeting and sinking ''Vikrant'', and ''Ghazi'' reached a location near Madras by the 23rd.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}}{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} In an attempt to deceive the Pakistan Navy and ''Ghazi'', India's Naval Headquarters deployed ''Rajput'' as a decoy\u2014the ship sailed {{convert|160|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Vishakhapatnam and broadcast a significant amount of radio traffic, making her appear to be ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=142}}\n\n''Ghazi'', meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} On the night of 3\u20134 December, a muffled underwater explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a [[clearance diver|clearance diving team]] was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that ''Ghazi'' had sunk in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\nThe reason for ''Ghazi''{{'}}s fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's official historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed the position of the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that ''Ghazi'' had come up to [[Periscope#Naval use|periscope depth]] to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to [[crash dive]], which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: on the night of the explosion, ''Rajput'' was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two [[depth charge]]s on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}} The third possibility is that there was a mishap when ''Ghazi'' was laying [[Naval mine|mines]] on the day before hostilities broke out.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\n''Vikrant'' was redeployed towards [[Chittagong]] at the outbreak of hostilities. On 4 December, the ship's Sea Hawks struck shipping in Chittagong and [[Cox's Bazar]] harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of the ships present. Later strikes targeted [[Khulna]] and the [[Port of Mongla]], which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan.{{Sfn|Roy|1995|p=165}} On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the [[cantonment]] area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Aliz\u00e9s continued on Cox's Bazar. After this, ''Vikrant''{{'}}s fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to [[Paradip]] for refueling.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=139}} The crew of INS ''Vikrant'' earned two [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s and twelve [[Vir Chakra]] gallantry medals for their part in the war.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}}\n\n===Later years===\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.jpg|thumb|A Sea King helicopter with INS ''Vikrant'']]\n''Vikrant'' did not see much service after the war, and was given two major modernisation [[refit]]s\u2014the first one from 1979 to 1981 and the second one from 1987 to 1989.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2009|p=151}} In the first phase, her boilers, radars, communication systems  and anti-aircraft guns were modernised, and facilities to operate Sea Harriers were installed.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=276}} In the second phase, facilities to operate the new Sea Harrier Vertical/Short Take Off and Land (V/STOL) fighter aircraft and the new Sea King Mk 42B Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters were introduced.
