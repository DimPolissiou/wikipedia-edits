The city is centred along the [[Brisbane River]], and its eastern suburbs line the shores of [[Moreton Bay]], a bay of the [[Coral Sea]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.\n\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are relatively calm, being sheltered from large [[swell (ocean)|swells]] by [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], [[North Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and [[Bribie Island|Bribie]] islands, whereas unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of the bay islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south.\n\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly.<ref name=\"thenandnow\">{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}</ref> The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Herbert Taylor Range]], such as the summit of [[Mount Coot-tha, Queensland|Mount Coot-tha]], reaching up to {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and the smaller [[Enoggera Hill]].

These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II.<ref name=\"oldwindmill\"/> The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records.

Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].

The Old Windmill was originally used for the grinding of grain and a punishment for the convicts who manually operated the grinding mill. The Old Windmill tower's other significant claim to fame, largely ignored, is that the first television signals in the southern hemisphere were transmitted from it by experimenters in April 1934\u2014long before TV commenced in most places. These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II.<ref name=\"oldwindmill\"/> The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records. Built with [[Brisbane tuff]] from the nearby [[Kangaroo Point Cliffs]] and sandstone from a quarry near today's Albion Park Racecourse, it is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane. It contains a museum and can also be hired for small functions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Australia's Capital Cities |last=Statham-Drew |first=Pamela|page=257 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40832-5 |year=1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Australia |last=Pike |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Insight |isbn=978-981-234-799-2 |year=2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |title=The Commissariat Stores |accessdate=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523150756/http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |archivedate=23 May 2008 }}</ref> Greater Brisbane had a density of {{convert|148|PD/sqkm}} in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|title=2016 Census Community Profile \u2013 Greater Brisbane (3GBRI \u2013 GCCSA)|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714080526/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|archivedate=14 July 2017}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081035/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |archivedate=14 July 2017}}, ZIPed Excel spreadsheet. Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].
