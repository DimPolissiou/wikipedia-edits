{"title_page": "Diego Bianchi", "text_new": "'''Diego Bianchi''' (born 1969 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]) is an Argentinian visual artist. He lives and works in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nDiego Bianchi received his degree in graphic design from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 1992, after which he participated in a critique seminar run by Pablo Siquier between 2002 and 2003. Between 2003 and 2005, Bianchi also participated in a program for visual artists co-run by the Centro Cultural Ricardo Rojas and the University of Buenos Aires, funded by the Beca Kuitca scholarship. He subsequently received a scholarship to attend [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] (Maine, USA), from which he graduated in 2006.\n\nBianchi has accrued extensive teaching experience, leading numerous workshops around the world. These include a number of critique seminars at the [[Universidad Torcuato di Tella]] Buenos Aires (2013, 2015); an Antiproject workshop at the [[Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste Berlin]] in Dresden, Germany (2016); and an artist workshop at the Mandale Fruta Lugano in Buenos Aires (2017). He has received a number of awards, including the arteBA-Petrobras Award to the visual arts in 2007 and the Grant of Secretar\u00eda de Cultura de la Naci\u00f3n in 2006.\n\nHe is represented by the Galerie Jocelyn Wolff in Paris, France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diego Bianchi \u2013 Biography |url=https://galeriewolff.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BIANCHI_Biography.pdf |website=Galerie Jocelyn Wolff |accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Artistic Work == \n\nA prominent figure on the Latin American art scene, Diego Bianchi\u2019s artistic work is made up of eclectic sculptures and installations, often utilizing elements of performance, which address both aesthetic standards and socio-political subjects. His pieces are constructed with visually transgressive materials that range from discarded objects such as chairs, pipes or electronics, to colorful casts of various body-parts, seemingly put together in a haphazard manner to create curious constructions that fill up the exhibition space. While the choice of material remains relatively open, Bianchi often works with smooth surfaces and placing and attaching them in various constellations. The discarded elements \u2013 which could be considered as trash \u2013 are transferred by the artist into a new context through their placement in a different artistic ecosystem, aesthetically working to \u201cdesanctify the work of art\u201d through their constant reconstructions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzenstein |first1=In\u00e9s |title=Irreversible |journal=RUB: Perspectivas sobre la obra de Diego Bianchi/Perspectives on the Work of Diego Bianchi |date=2019 |pages=262-269}}</ref> This approach is most visible in Bianchi\u2019s recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires, El presente est\u00e1 encantador (2017), in which a number of individual sculptures made up of haphazardly fused and seemingly random elements take over the space holding the museum\u2019s permanent collection, directing the viewer into a dialogue with his precedents.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Villa |first1=Javier |title=Press Release - El Presente Est\u00e1 Encantador/ The Enchanting Now |journal=Museo de Arte Moderno - MAMBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina |date=2017}}</ref>\n\nDiego Bianchi\u2019s work is situated on the border between realist and conceptualist traditions, with many of his approach being traceable to the oeuvre of European artists such as Piero Manzoni, Daniel Spoerri, Guiseppe Penone, Arman.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzenstein |first1=In\u00e9s |title=Irreversible |journal=RUB: Perspectivas sobre la obra de Diego Bianchi/Perspectives on the Work of Diego Bianchi |date=2019 |pages=262-269}}</ref> \n\nOne of the more dominant themes of Bianchi\u2019s work is the repetitive use of the human body as an artistic element. While visible already in his earlier works, the emphasis on the physical has become more influential in his recent sculptures and installations. Citing the words of feminist artist Barbara Krueger, he takes an approach in which the \u201cbody is more a battlefield than a temple\u201d, and therefore an object to be dismembered and distorted. These recent works, such as Pooldance 4 (2017) or Multileg (2017), actively assemble and dis-assemble the borders between the human and the object. Linked to overarching themes of deconstruction and unraveling, these works disrupt the viewer\u2019s expectations and play with the borders between the personal and the impersonal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Massacese |first1=Julieta |title=Life Ensues at Another Pace: Uses and Dimensions of the Body in the Work of Diego Bianchi |journal=RUB: Perspectivas sobre la obra de Diego Bianchi/Perspectives on the Work of Diego Bianchi |date=2019}</ref>    The Suspension of Disbelief (2014) is a work which activates these notions in a performance piece. Taking over the entire room, the installation is activated by the performer who suspended on a web of strings attached to his clothing and to his body: the mouth, a finger, his uncovered penis or from both sides of his t-shirt. Every movement also moves the strings, connecting the body to eerie objects that resemble severed body-parts formed out of latex or plastic, or to everyday objects such as a broom or a chair.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pontbriand |first1=Chantal |title=A late evening in the future |journal=RUB |date=date unknown}}</ref>  The preoccupation with the physical appears also in earlier installations, such as the entrance designed by the artist for his exhibition Imperialismo Minimalism (2006) at the Sendros Gallery in Buenos Aires.

Starting at the early 2000s, his pieces reflect the evolution of this process brought to the foreground by the spread of neoliberalist policies in Latin America, expressed through an extensive engagement with the relationship between bodies, objects and the spaces which they inhabit.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ostrander |first1=Tobias |title=Waste After Waste - Press Release |journal=P\u00e9rez Art museum, Miami, USA |date=2015 |url=https://galeriewolff.com/artists/diego-bianchi/}}</ref> At the same time, through exhibitions such as Shutdown (2016), the artist engages with the perceived numbness of the contemporary art world towards social issues, and the disconnect between the proliferation of aesthetically idyllic art and the more brutal world which it inhabits.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sztulwark |first1=Diego |title=Shutdown - Press Release |journal=Barro Arte contempor\u00e1neo, Buenos Aires, Argentina |date=2016 |url=https://galeriewolff.com/artists/diego-bianchi/}}</ref>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n=== Selected solo exhibitions ===\n* 2019: Soft Realism, Galerie Jocelyn Wolff, Paris \n* 2018: Pervert Vitrine, 7 rue de la R\u00e9publique, Marseille \n* 2017: Museo abandonado [Abandoned Museum].

He later attended Harris High School in Rugby from 1995\u20131999.\n\n==Career==\nMkandawire was a trainee at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] for five seasons but did not make an appearance for the first team due to the lack of opportunities at the club at the time. Albion released him in 2004 after winning promotion to the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~523251,00.html\n|title=Albion release eight players\n|publisher=West Bromwich F.C.\n|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Hereford United===\nHaving had two loan spells with [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in the 2003\u201304 season, he signed permanently for them for the 2004\u201305 season. Prior to this he had a trial in the United States with [[New England Revolution]].\n\nHe was a first team regular at centre-back in the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305 season]] making the most appearances of all the central defenders in the squad. He also chipped in with six goals, more than any other defender that season. This consistency continued into the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] where he missed only four matches, and scored nine goals. When club captain Tony James was injured, Mkandawire took the captain's armband and led Hereford to the playoff final, scoring in the crucial semi-final against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]]. He lifted the trophy after a 3\u20132 win over [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax]] and was subsequently named Player of the Year, for the second season in succession.\n\nFor the 2006\u201307 season he was named as team captain for Hereford's first season back in the Football League. He was a regular in Hereford's defence, scoring twice in the league, and his solid performances had led to speculation over him moving to a bigger club. Despite an improved contract offer in December 2006, which reportedly would have made him the highest earner in the club's history, he decided that his future lay elsewhere.\n\n===Leyton Orient===\nOn 6 June 2007 he signed a three-year deal with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], who had previously seen a \u00a360,000 bid rejected.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leyton_orient/6728037.stm\n|title=O's swoop for Bulls' Mkandawire\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=6 June 2007\n|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref> Dubbed one of the best young centre backs in the Football League, he made his Orient debut in a 2\u20131 win at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 11 August 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n|date=11 August 2007\n|url=http://www.leytonorient.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10439~37459,00.html\n|title=Southend vs Leyton Orient\n|publisher=Leyton Orient F.C.\n|accessdate=2 September 2007}}</ref> Three weeks later, on 1 September, Mkandawire scored his first goal for the club \u2013 and Orient's 5000th in league football \u2013 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]].<ref>{{cite news\n|date=1 September 2007\n|url=http://www.leytonorient.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10439~37512,00.html\n|title=Leyton Orient vs Northampton\n|publisher=Leyton Orient F.C.\n|accessdate=2 September 2007}}</ref> His performance in Orient's 1\u20130 home win over [[A.F.C.

He later attended Harris High School in Rugby from 1995\u20131999.\n\n==Career==\nMkandawire was a trainee at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] for five seasons but did not make an appearance for the first team due to the lack of opportunities at the club at the time. Albion released him in 2004 after winning promotion to the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~523251,00.html\n|title=Albion release eight players\n|publisher=West Bromwich F.C.\n|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Hereford United===\nHaving had two loan spells with [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in the 2003\u201304 season, he signed permanently for them for the 2004\u201305 season. Prior to this he had a trial in the United States with [[New England Revolution]].\n\nHe was a first team regular at centre-back in the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305 season]] making the most appearances of all the central defenders in the squad. He also chipped in with six goals, more than any other defender that season. This consistency continued into the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] where he missed only four matches, and scored nine goals. When club captain Tony James was injured, Mkandawire took the captain's armband and led Hereford to the playoff final, scoring in the crucial semi-final against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]]. He lifted the trophy after a 3\u20132 win over [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax]] and was subsequently named Player of the Year, for the second season in succession.\n\nFor the 2006\u201307 season he was named as team captain for Hereford's first season back in the Football League. He was a regular in Hereford's defence, scoring twice in the league, and his solid performances had led to speculation over him moving to a bigger club. Despite an improved contract offer in December 2006, which reportedly would have made him the highest earner in the club's history, he decided that his future lay elsewhere.\n\n===Leyton Orient===\nOn 6 June 2007 he signed a three-year deal with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], who had previously seen a \u00a360,000 bid rejected.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leyton_orient/6728037.stm\n|title=O's swoop for Bulls' Mkandawire\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=6 June 2007\n|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref> Dubbed one of the best young centre backs in the Football League, he made his Orient debut in a 2\u20131 win at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 11 August 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n|date=11 August 2007\n|url=http://www.leytonorient.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10439~37459,00.html\n|title=Southend vs Leyton Orient\n|publisher=Leyton Orient F.C.\n|accessdate=2 September 2007}}</ref> Three weeks later, on 1 September, Mkandawire scored his first goal for the club \u2013 and Orient's 5000th in league football \u2013 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]].<ref>{{cite news\n|date=1 September 2007\n|url=http://www.leytonorient.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10439~37512,00.html\n|title=Leyton Orient vs Northampton\n|publisher=Leyton Orient F.C.\n|accessdate=2 September 2007}}</ref> His performance in Orient's 1\u20130 home win over [[A.F.C.

He is also an accomplished multi-instrumentalist who works across many genres including classical, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music. He performs regularly on guitar, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki and vocals.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com daveflynn.com]. daveflynn.com (17 November 2010). Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n==Early experiences==\nFlynn was born and raised in [[Dublin]], Ireland. His early musical experiences included brief periods studying piano and tin whistle, but it was not until his early teens that Flynn really took to music, teaching himself how to play rock guitar. He developed an interest in classical guitar in his mid-teens and taught himself how to read music notation, he also learnt classical guitar by ear from recordings. He composed his first piece for classical guitar aged 16.\n\nUpon leaving school in 1995 he studied rock music at [[Ballyfermot]] Senior College, Dublin. Around this time Flynn started composing songs and became a regular performer on the Dublin singer-songwriter scene which spawned some of Ireland's current crop of successful songwriters such as [[Damien Rice]] and [[Damien Dempsey]]. He was also lead guitarist of the rock band Maize.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/songwriter.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124726/http://www.daveflynn.com/songwriter.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref> He later developed a strong interest in [[traditional Irish music]] which he learnt through recordings and workshops at various Irish music festivals.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/Irish.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124742/http://www.daveflynn.com/Irish.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Formal studies==\nIn 1998 Flynn began formal classical music studies at the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama, initially studying classical guitar on a part-time basis with [[John Feeley]]. In 1999 he enrolled in the full-time music degree course at the Conservatory, continuing his guitar studies with Feeley while majoring in composition. Now fully committed to composing, Flynn won the [[Irish Music Rights Organisation|IMRO]] Composition Award in 2002 at the [[Feis Ceoil]] in Dublin for his string orchestra piece ''Mesh''.\n\nWhile at DIT he co-founded the [[Dublin Guitar Quartet]] with fellow students. He graduated in 2003 at which time he left the Dublin Guitar Quartet in order to move to London where he became the first person from the Republic of Ireland to be accepted onto the master's degree in Composition course at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. He was awarded bursaries from the [[Arts Council of Ireland]], Guildhall Trust and [[Michael Collins Memorial Foundation]] in order to fund these studies. At Guildhall he studied composition with [[Malcolm Singer]] and electro-acoustic music with [[Nye Parry]] and he formed his own ensemble, the David Flynn Collective. He graduated from the Guildhall in 2004.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/Classical.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321165221/http://www.daveflynn.com/Classical.htm |date=21 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe returned to DIT in 2006 where he undertook a research Ph.D. entitled ''Traditional Irish Music: A Path to New Music''.

His prize was a commission to elaborate ''Slip'' into his ''String Quartet No. 2 \"The Cranning\"'' for the 2005 festival where it was premiered by the [[Smith Quartet]] to the acclaim of critics including Neil Fisher of ''The Times'' who praised Flynn for \"incorporating traditional Irish music without Hollywood pastiche\".<ref>Fisher, Neil: \"Concert: Huddersfield Festival\", in: ''The Times'', 30 November 2005.</ref>\n\nMusic critic Michael Dervan of ''The Irish Times'' wrote: \"Flynn is attempting to bring the influence of traditional Irish music into the hallowed realms of the classical string quartet and moments in the Smith Quartet's performance of this minimalist influenced work gelled to perfection.\"<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2005/1130/1132330257845.html ireland.com \u2013 The Irish Times \u2013 Wed, 30 Nov 2005 \u2013 Experiments with sound<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEarlier in 2004 Flynn had instigated the foundation of the [[Young Composers Collective]] (YCC) in Ireland. Flynn announced the YCC with an article in the [[Journal of Music in Ireland]] (JMI) in which he criticised established bodies for failing to support young composers. The article caused considerable controversy and debate but ultimately led to the YCC providing a platform for a large number of previously unknown young composers to have their music performed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejmi.com/article/240 |title=The JMI : Young Composers' Collective : David Flynn<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=30 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117031713/http://www.thejmi.com/article/240 |archive-date=17 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The YCC has since evolved into the [[Irish Composers' Collective]].

Despite some harsh criticism of Flynn's ideas from some of the established Irish composers, his article resonated with traditional Irish musicians who had in the past largely been ignored or denigrated by the Irish classical music establishment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejmi.com/article/317 |title=The JMI : Looking for the Irish Bart\u00f3k : David Flynn<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=30 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117050128/http://www.thejmi.com/article/317 |archive-date=17 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis article directly led to Flynn's contact with the renowned traditional Irish fiddler [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]] and his musical partner, guitarist [[Dennis Cahill (musician)|Dennis Cahill]]. In 2006, the [[Masters of Tradition Festival]] in Cork commissioned Flynn to compose a piece for Hayes and Cahill to perform with the classical violinist [[Ioana Petcu-Colan]]. The resulting piece ''Music for the Departed'' was premiered at the Masters of Tradition Festival in August 2006 and received its US Premiere in 2010 at the Irish American Arts Center in New York. It was described as \"A magnificent new work for fiddle, violin and guitar\" by the ''Irish Examiner'' (USA).<ref>[http://www.irishexaminerusa.com/mt/2010/03/23/out_about_113.html Out & About]. Irish Examiner USA. Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFlynn has since worked with [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]] on a number of other projects. In 2010, Hayes premiered ''Aontacht'', a concerto for Irish fiddle and orchestra with the [[RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra]] in Ireland's National Concert Hall. The concert also featured a new arrangement of ''Music for the Departed'' with a string orchestra added to the fiddle, violin and guitar trio of the original.<ref name=\"wordpress1\">[http://daveflynnnews.wordpress.com/ Dave Flynn News Page | Just another WordPress.com weblog]. Daveflynnnews.wordpress.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n''Aontacht'' was widely praised as a ground-breaking work. [[The Journal of Music|Journal of Music]] editor Toner Quinn wrote \"The precision of Flynn\u2019s writing displayed years of studying the music of Hayes: his style, rhythm, technical ability and aesthetic. At the same time, the composer moved the fiddle-player into unfamiliar territory, compelling him to climb through shifting, plated orchestral accompaniment. Each time Hayes arrived at a plateau, Flynn had spun the map, but Hayes was undeterred, ascending and chasing even harder. It was thrilling, heady and explosive. Brophy danced on the podium. I moved to the edge of my seat.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tonerquinn.com/2014/01/31/music-and-the-betrayal-of-ireland/|title=Music and the Betrayal of Ireland|last=tonerquinn|date=2014-01-31|website=Toner Quinn|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIrish Times critic Michael Dervan wrote \"Flynn\u2019s new Aontacht, premiered by Hayes with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra under David Brophy on Wednesday, is no conventional concerto. There\u2019s not really much in the way of dialogue or give and take. It\u2019s a vehicle for a traditional musician, with the orchestra cast in the role of a backing group, a sometimes assertive and noisy backing group, but a backing group nonetheless. And the soloist is worked pretty hard, with hardly a pause for breath. The solo part is unconventional, too \u2013 all notated with precision, but not intended to be played as written. It\u2019s more on the lines of a template, which the fiddler can adapt to his own preferred inflections or spur-of-the-moment inspiration. Hayes is one of those players who projects a great sense of long-term purpose. His energy feels as if it\u2019s focused on a point that\u2019s well ahead of wherever he\u2019s actually at. You don\u2019t just want to hear him in the now, you want to stay with him to experience the future he\u2019s so clearly promising. He sustained that unflagging sense of focus through the strange tilt and lilt of Flynn\u2019s melodic writing.

This is an unusual opera as it calls for vocalists who sing in the Irish traditional [[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean n\u00f3s]] style rather than a classical singing style. The bi-lingual libretto was written in English by P\u00e1draic O'Beirn and Dave Flynn with Irish translations by Billy Mag Fhloinn.

Flynn remained in London until the beginning of 2006 when he returned to live in Ireland.\n\nFlynn continues to build a parallel career as concert music composer and multi-genre performer. His debut recording '[[Dra\u00edocht]]', a mix of traditional Irish music and new compositions and songs based on the tradition, was released late in 2006. Most of the songs on the album were co-written with the poet/lyricist [[P\u00e1draic \u00d3'Be\u00edrn]]. Also featured on the album are some of his regular musical partners including fiddler [[Liz Coleman (musician)|Liz Coleman]], percussionist [[Aidan Dunphy]], bassist [[Brian O'Toole]] and guitarist [[Ciar\u00e1n Swift]]. The album was co-produced by Flynn with engineers [[Manus Lunny]] and Paul Thomas. Writing in Irish Music Magazine, critic John O'Regan says, \"Dra\u00edocht is one of the most surprising debuts to hit my ears in ages ... An interesting and intriguing collection from a tunesmith, instrumentalist and composer, Dave Flynn is a name to conjure with and Dra\u00edocht is very definitely worth an open-minded listen.\"<ref>[http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/releases/0712dec/ December 2007].

There is also music by [[Ed Reavy]], [[Liz Carroll]]. [[Charlie Lennon]], [[Larry Redican]] and [[Tommy Peoples]]. One of Flynn's own compositions, ''The Mahatma of the Glen'', a tribute to the late fiddle player [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]], also features.

He is the founder and artistic director of the [[Irish Memory Orchestra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishmemoryorchestra.com/|title=DAVE FLYNN'S IRISH MEMORY ORCHESTRA|website=DAVE FLYNN'S IRISH MEMORY ORCHESTRA|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> His recent music is noteworthy for merging the influence of traditional [[Irish music]] with contemporary classical music and [[jazz]]. He is also an accomplished multi-instrumentalist who works across many genres including classical, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music. He performs regularly on guitar, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki and vocals.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com daveflynn.com]. daveflynn.com (17 November 2010). Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n==Early experiences==\nFlynn was born and raised in [[Dublin]], Ireland. His early musical experiences included brief periods studying piano and tin whistle, but it was not until his early teens that Flynn really took to music, teaching himself how to play rock guitar. He developed an interest in classical guitar in his mid-teens and taught himself how to read music notation, he also learnt classical guitar by ear from recordings. He composed his first piece for classical guitar aged 16.\n\nUpon leaving school in 1995 he studied rock music at [[Ballyfermot]] Senior College, Dublin. Around this time Flynn started composing songs and became a regular performer on the Dublin singer-songwriter scene which spawned some of Ireland's current crop of successful songwriters such as [[Damien Rice]] and [[Damien Dempsey]]. He was also lead guitarist of the rock band Maize.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/songwriter.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124726/http://www.daveflynn.com/songwriter.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref> He later developed a strong interest in [[traditional Irish music]] which he learnt through recordings and workshops at various Irish music festivals.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/Irish.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124742/http://www.daveflynn.com/Irish.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Formal studies==\nIn 1998 Flynn began formal classical music studies at the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama, initially studying classical guitar on a part-time basis with [[John Feeley]]. In 1999 he enrolled in the full-time music degree course at the Conservatory, continuing his guitar studies with Feeley while majoring in composition. Now fully committed to composing, Flynn won the [[Irish Music Rights Organisation|IMRO]] Composition Award in 2002 at the [[Feis Ceoil]] in Dublin for his string orchestra piece ''Mesh''.\n\nWhile at DIT he co-founded the [[Dublin Guitar Quartet]] with fellow students. He graduated in 2003 at which time he left the Dublin Guitar Quartet in order to move to London where he became the first person from the Republic of Ireland to be accepted onto the master's degree in Composition course at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. He was awarded bursaries from the [[Arts Council of Ireland]], Guildhall Trust and [[Michael Collins Memorial Foundation]] in order to fund these studies. At Guildhall he studied composition with [[Malcolm Singer]] and electro-acoustic music with [[Nye Parry]] and he formed his own ensemble, the David Flynn Collective. He graduated from the Guildhall in 2004.<ref>[http://www.daveflynn.com/Classical.htm daveflynn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321165221/http://www.daveflynn.com/Classical.htm |date=21 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe returned to DIT in 2006 where he undertook a research Ph.D. entitled ''Traditional Irish Music: A Path to New Music''.

His works from this period are often influenced by the minimalist music of [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams,]] [[Philip Glass]] and [[Steve Reich]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmcireland.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/new-volume-of-complete-works-for-solo-guitar-by-dave-flynn/|title=New volume of complete works for Solo Guitar by Dave Flynn|last=Cmcireland|date=2011-02-03|website=Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nSoon after graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 2004, Flynn's string quartet piece ''Slip'' was selected for the Young Composers Workshop at the 2004 [[Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival]], which led to Flynn being awarded the 2004 Young Composers Award at the Festival. His prize was a commission to elaborate ''Slip'' into his ''String Quartet No. 2 \"The Cranning\"'' for the 2005 festival where it was premiered by the [[Smith Quartet]] to the acclaim of critics including Neil Fisher of ''The Times'' who praised Flynn for \"incorporating traditional Irish music without Hollywood pastiche\".<ref>Fisher, Neil: \"Concert: Huddersfield Festival\", in: ''The Times'', 30 November 2005.</ref>\n\nMusic critic Michael Dervan of ''The Irish Times'' wrote: \"Flynn is attempting to bring the influence of traditional Irish music into the hallowed realms of the classical string quartet and moments in the Smith Quartet's performance of this minimalist influenced work gelled to perfection.\"<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2005/1130/1132330257845.html ireland.com \u2013 The Irish Times \u2013 Wed, 30 Nov 2005 \u2013 Experiments with sound<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEarlier in 2004 Flynn had instigated the foundation of the [[Young Composers Collective]] (YCC) in Ireland. Flynn announced the YCC with an article in the [[Journal of Music in Ireland]] (JMI) in which he criticised established bodies for failing to support young composers. The article caused considerable controversy and debate but ultimately led to the YCC providing a platform for a large number of previously unknown young composers to have their music performed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejmi.com/article/240 |title=The JMI : Young Composers' Collective : David Flynn<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=30 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117031713/http://www.thejmi.com/article/240 |archive-date=17 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The YCC has since evolved into the [[Irish Composers' Collective]].

Despite some harsh criticism of Flynn's ideas from some of the established Irish composers, his article resonated with traditional Irish musicians who had in the past largely been ignored or denigrated by the Irish classical music establishment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejmi.com/article/317 |title=The JMI : Looking for the Irish Bart\u00f3k : David Flynn<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=30 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117050128/http://www.thejmi.com/article/317 |archive-date=17 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis article directly led to Flynn's contact with the renowned traditional Irish fiddler [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]] and his musical partner, guitarist [[Dennis Cahill (musician)|Dennis Cahill]]. In 2006, the [[Masters of Tradition Festival]] in Cork commissioned Flynn to compose a piece for Hayes and Cahill to perform with the classical violinist [[Ioana Petcu-Colan]]. The resulting piece ''Music for the Departed'' was premiered at the Masters of Tradition Festival in August 2006 and received its US Premiere in 2010 at the Irish American Arts Center in New York. It was described as \"A magnificent new work for fiddle, violin and guitar\" by the ''Irish Examiner'' (USA).<ref>[http://www.irishexaminerusa.com/mt/2010/03/23/out_about_113.html Out & About]. Irish Examiner USA. Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n=== 2010's ===\nFlynn has since worked with [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]] on a number of other projects. In 2010, Hayes premiered ''Aontacht'', a concerto for Irish fiddle and orchestra with the [[RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra]] in Ireland's National Concert Hall. The concert also featured a new arrangement of ''Music for the Departed'' with a string orchestra added to the fiddle, violin and guitar trio of the original.<ref name=\"wordpress1\">[http://daveflynnnews.wordpress.com/ Dave Flynn News Page | Just another WordPress.com weblog]. Daveflynnnews.wordpress.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\n''Aontacht'' was widely praised as a ground-breaking work. [[The Journal of Music|Journal of Music]] editor Toner Quinn wrote \"The precision of Flynn\u2019s writing displayed years of studying the music of Hayes: his style, rhythm, technical ability and aesthetic. At the same time, the composer moved the fiddle-player into unfamiliar territory, compelling him to climb through shifting, plated orchestral accompaniment. Each time Hayes arrived at a plateau, Flynn had spun the map, but Hayes was undeterred, ascending and chasing even harder. It was thrilling, heady and explosive. Brophy danced on the podium. I moved to the edge of my seat.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tonerquinn.com/2014/01/31/music-and-the-betrayal-of-ireland/|title=Music and the Betrayal of Ireland|last=tonerquinn|date=2014-01-31|website=Toner Quinn|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIrish Times critic Michael Dervan wrote \"Flynn\u2019s new Aontacht, premiered by Hayes with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra under David Brophy on Wednesday, is no conventional concerto. There\u2019s not really much in the way of dialogue or give and take. It\u2019s a vehicle for a traditional musician, with the orchestra cast in the role of a backing group, a sometimes assertive and noisy backing group, but a backing group nonetheless. And the soloist is worked pretty hard, with hardly a pause for breath. The solo part is unconventional, too \u2013 all notated with precision, but not intended to be played as written. It\u2019s more on the lines of a template, which the fiddler can adapt to his own preferred inflections or spur-of-the-moment inspiration. Hayes is one of those players who projects a great sense of long-term purpose. His energy feels as if it\u2019s focused on a point that\u2019s well ahead of wherever he\u2019s actually at. You don\u2019t just want to hear him in the now, you want to stay with him to experience the future he\u2019s so clearly promising. He sustained that unflagging sense of focus through the strange tilt and lilt of Flynn\u2019s melodic writing. And it was in the work\u2019s most unrelentingly busy movement, the finale which the composer describes as an \u201cepic reel which climbs gradually from the depths of anger to the heights of ecstasy\u201d, that performer and work seemed most effectively aligned.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/martin-hayes-fiddle-dennis-cahill-guitar-brona-cahill-violin-rt%C3%A9-co-david-brophy-1.679117|title=Martin Hayes (fiddle), Dennis Cahill (guitar), Brona Cahill (violin), RT\u00c9 CO/David Brophy|last=Dervan|first=Michael|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nFlynn continues to work with traditional Irish musicians in the creation of new concert works.

This is an unusual opera as it calls for vocalists who sing in the Irish traditional [[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean n\u00f3s]] style rather than a classical singing style. The bi-lingual libretto was written in English by P\u00e1draic O'Beirn and Dave Flynn with Irish translations by Billy Mag Fhloinn. The opera was premiered in St. Flannan's Cathedral, [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daveflynn.com/mna-brian-boru.html|title=Mna Brian Boru|website=DAVE FLYNN COMPOSER/GUITARIST|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2014, Flynn released a minimalist solo electric guitar album \"Winter Variations\" on his label Frisbee Records.

Flynn remained in London until the beginning of 2006 when he returned to live in Ireland.\n\nFlynn continues to build a parallel career as concert music composer and multi-genre performer. His debut recording '[[Dra\u00edocht]]', a mix of traditional Irish music and new compositions and songs based on the tradition, was released late in 2006. Most of the songs on the album were co-written with the poet/lyricist [[P\u00e1draic \u00d3'Be\u00edrn]]. Also featured on the album are some of his regular musical partners including fiddler [[Liz Coleman (musician)|Liz Coleman]], percussionist [[Aidan Dunphy]], bassist [[Brian O'Toole]] and guitarist [[Ciar\u00e1n Swift]]. The album was co-produced by Flynn with engineers [[Manus Lunny]] and Paul Thomas. Writing in Irish Music Magazine, critic John O'Regan says, \"Dra\u00edocht is one of the most surprising debuts to hit my ears in ages ... An interesting and intriguing collection from a tunesmith, instrumentalist and composer, Dave Flynn is a name to conjure with and Dra\u00edocht is very definitely worth an open-minded listen.\"<ref>[http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/releases/0712dec/ December 2007]. Irish Music Magazine. Retrieved on 2013-06-07.</ref>\n\nFlynn's second album, ''Contemporary Traditional Irish Guitar'', was released in 2009 on Frisbee Records. The album contains completely solo guitar versions of music by some of the best traditional Irish music composers of the 20th Century, most particularly [[Paddy Fahey]], 20 Fahey compositions feature on the album. There is also music by [[Ed Reavy]], [[Liz Carroll]]. [[Charlie Lennon]], [[Larry Redican]] and [[Tommy Peoples]]. One of Flynn's own compositions, ''The Mahatma of the Glen'', a tribute to the late fiddle player [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]], also features. This is a reworking of three of the sections of his earlier piece ''Music for the Departed''. The album has received considerable critical acclaim.<ref>[http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/releases/0610june/ June 2010]. Irish Music Magazine.

The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of [[capillary|capillaries]] around the ophthalmic branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]], just under the surface of the face. There is also malformation of blood vessels in the [[pia mater]] overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark. This causes [[calcification]] of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the [[cerebral cortex]].\n\nNeurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age. Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark, which vary in severity. There may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark.\n\nSome children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays; about 50% will have [[glaucoma]] (optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure), which can be present at birth or develop later. Glaucoma can be expressed as [[leukocoria]], which should include also further evaluation for [[retinoblastoma]]. Increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket ([[buphthalmos]]).\n\nSturge\u2013Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby's head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS due to mutation of gene GNAQ, this network of nerves doesn't go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and blood flowing to the brain, which can affect brain tissue development.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{See also|List of radiographic findings associated with cutaneous conditions}}\n[[Computed tomography|CT]] and [[MRI]] are most often used to identify intracranial abnormalities. When a child is born with a facial cutaneous vascular malformation covering a portion of the upper or the lower eyelids, imaging should be performed to screen for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The haemangioma present on the surface of the brain is in the vast majority of cases on the same side as the birth mark and gradually results in calcification of the underlying brain and atrophy of the affected region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sturge-Weber syndrome: Radiopaedia.org|url=http://radiopaedia.org/articles/sturge-weber-syndrome-1}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment for Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome is symptomatic. [[Laser surgery|Laser]] treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark. [[Anticonvulsant]] medications may be used to control seizures. Doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma, and surgery may be performed on more serious cases.  When one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective, the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain ([[hemispherectomy]]). [[Physical therapy]] should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. [[Educational Therapy|Educational therapy]] is often prescribed for those with intellectual disability or developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays.\nBrain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than pre-surgery. Surgeons may also opt to \"switch-off\" the affected side of the brain.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13471262 |title=Norfolk girl recovers after half of brain 'switched off' |work=BBC News | date=2011-05-20}}</ref>\n\nLatanoprost (Xalatan), a [[prostaglandin]], may significantly reduce IOP ([[intraocular pressure]]) in patients with [[glaucoma]] associated with Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome. [[Latanoprost]] is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC).  The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of ethnicity, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects.  Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]] loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of [[anterior uveitis]], and [[diabetes mellitus]]. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or [[hypertrichosis]] that may become cosmetically objectionable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of [[capillary|capillaries]] around the ophthalmic branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]], just under the surface of the face. There is also malformation of blood vessels in the [[pia mater]] overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark. This causes [[calcification]] of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the [[cerebral cortex]].\n\nNeurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age. Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark, which vary in severity. There may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark.\n\nSome children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays; about 50% will have [[glaucoma]] (optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure), which can be present at birth or develop later. Glaucoma can be expressed as [[leukocoria]], which should include also further evaluation for [[retinoblastoma]]. Increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket ([[buphthalmos]]).\n\nSturge\u2013Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby's head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS due to mutation of gene GNAQ, this network of nerves doesn't go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and blood flowing to the brain, which can affect brain tissue development.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{See also|List of radiographic findings associated with cutaneous conditions}}\n[[Computed tomography|CT]] and [[MRI]] are most often used to identify intracranial abnormalities. When a child is born with a facial cutaneous vascular malformation covering a portion of the upper or the lower eyelids, imaging should be performed to screen for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The haemangioma present on the surface of the brain is in the vast majority of cases on the same side as the birth mark and gradually results in calcification of the underlying brain and atrophy of the affected region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sturge-Weber syndrome: Radiopaedia.org|url=http://radiopaedia.org/articles/sturge-weber-syndrome-1}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment for Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome is symptomatic. [[Laser surgery|Laser]] treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark. [[Anticonvulsant]] medications may be used to control seizures. Doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma, and surgery may be performed on more serious cases.  When one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective, the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain ([[hemispherectomy]]). [[Physical therapy]] should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. [[Educational Therapy|Educational therapy]] is often prescribed for those with intellectual disability or developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays.\nBrain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than pre-surgery. Surgeons may also opt to \"switch-off\" the affected side of the brain.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13471262 |title=Norfolk girl recovers after half of brain 'switched off' |work=BBC News | date=2011-05-20}}</ref>\n\nLatanoprost (Xalatan), a [[prostaglandin]], may significantly reduce IOP ([[intraocular pressure]]) in patients with [[glaucoma]] associated with Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome. [[Latanoprost]] is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC).  The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of ethnicity, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects.  Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]] loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of [[anterior uveitis]], and [[diabetes mellitus]]. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or [[hypertrichosis]] that may become cosmetically objectionable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures are resistant to treatment.

This traded as Maison Auzoux. Auzoux also made large scale zoological and botanical models for educational use. The models were called \"anatomy clastique\" (Greek klastos - broken in pieces), because they could be taken apart to show the full structure. The company also traded in other natural history material.\n\n==Fabrication process==\n\nThe process invented by Dr Auzoux consisted in a mix of paper pulp, glue and cork powder, pressed in paper-lined molds, following papier-mach\u00e9 method.<ref> \u00ab Guillaume Ruiz. Les mod\u00e8les en papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 du Docteur Auzoux au mus\u00e9e de l'Ecole v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d'Alfort, Th\u00e8se de doctorat v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire, 2009 \u00bb [archive] (consult\u00e9 le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2012).</ref>\n\nFor simpler, less articulated pieces, like large-scale representations of organs, he used plaster molds lined with several layers of colored paper imbibed with glue. The glue-moistened paper follows every detail of the mold ; the layers, starting with thin paper then progressing on heavier paper, will give resistance to the future piece. The use of papers of different colours helps keeping trace of the layers. As many as twelve layers of paper could be used. The model thus obtained was hollow, light and resistant. \n\nFor articulated pieces, he designed a paste that would dry in a material dense enough that fasteners and hinges could be fixed, or include metal frames for larger models.\nThe molds used in that case were in a metal alloy. Workers would line them with a paper and cardboard shell, consisting of only 3 to 4 layers, then fill them with the paste, called \"terre\" = earth, made of flour glue, shredded paper, shredded oakum, chalk and cork powder, the latter said to be the crucial ingredient in the mix. The mold was then closed and placed under a press to compact the paste and spread it into the finest details.\nThe dried pieces were then completed with details such as veins, arteries and nerves made of fabric-covered metal wires, equipped with closing hooks, painted, labelled, varnished and assembled.\n\n==The anatomical models factory in Saint-Aubin-d'\u00c9crosville==\n\nThe success met in France and abroad by his anatomical reproductions, due to their technicity and accuracy led the Dr. Auzoux to found a workshop in his birthplace village Saint-Aubin-d'\u00c9crosville (Eure, France). \nThe number of workers grew and by 1868, more than eighty men and women were employed to produce hundred of pieces sold worldwide each year. A shop was also opened 8 rue du Paon in Paris in 1833, that would ship sales in France and other countries. \nWhen Louis Auzoux died in 1880, his clastic anatomical models were internationally known and his society prosperous.\nThe competition and multiplication of other kinds of teaching aids for the study of anatomy (photography, video, digital models, plastination...) led the Auzoux firm to turn to other materials, like cheaper resin models in the 1980s, then close in the early 2000s. \nThe [[:fr:Mus%C3%A9e de l%27%C3%A9corch%C3%A9 d%27anatomie|Mus\u00e9e de l'Ecorch\u00e9]] opened in nearby Le Neubourg (Eure, France) with a collection of production tools and models salvaged from the closing factory, and the input of former workers on techniques used.\n\nThe personal archives of Dr Louis Auzoux are kept in the French national archives (Archives nationales) under shelf number 242AP.\n\n==Works and publications==\n*'Anatomie clastique du Dr Auzoux: tableau synoptique du cheval', \u00c9diteur : l'auteur (Paris), 1845, 1 vol.
